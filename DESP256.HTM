 DESPERADO, Born with the gift of laughter and a sense that the world is mad

 Perhaps the strangest of all O.J. facts:  When the police searched
 his house they seized a tape of a recent movie because one of the
 songs on the soundtrack was "Backstabbers" by the O'Jays.

     Richard Meinertzhagen, "Middle East Diary, 1917-1956" (NY: Thomas
Yoseloff, 1959).  Whew!  What a character!  This book is part diary
entries, part his letters to various government officials, part
his letters to The Times on Zionism, of which which he was a rabid
supporter although not himself Jewish.  The book covers the period
from his intelligence work during WWI (which he combined with
ornithology) -- he does a section on T.E. Lawrence -- through
his service as General Allenby's Political Officer in Jerusalem
then the Colonial Office and the War Office in London.  Meinertzhagen
is always right (it's HIS diary, after all).  He never ceases to
lambast everyone concerned for what he felt was Britain's betrayal
of the Balfour Declaration.
     He is big on 'taking action.'  Example:  In 1939 he went alone
but carrying a loaded revolver to a meeting with Hitler and Ribbentrop,
and durned near used it on Hitler.  He always regretted that he had
not.  Example:  In 1948 he goes out to tour around Israel.  His
ship docks at Haifa.  From the porthole he sees a group of Hagganah
chasing Palestinians through the streets, firing at them.  Meinerzhagen
borrows the gun of a British soldier in sick bay on the ship and
rushes down the gangplank and actually gets off a couple of shots
before the people responsible for him get him corralled.
     On an Arab who disagreed with him:  "He is as big a fox as ever,
disguising his dishonest and immoral nature behind his fat, jovial,
schoolboy face.  He is not half as able as Nuri nor has he half the
energy.  During the last war he fought with us and against us.  He
is a dangerous rogue."
     "Hitler raised his hand exclaiming 'Heil Hitler;' I thought it
rather odd that he should 'heil' himself, so I raised my hand and
said, 'Heil Meinertzhagen.'  Nobody smiled."

Subject: [dgg: To kiss a Frog.]

From: David Grubbs &lt;dgg&gt;

A computer programmer happens across a frog in the road.  The frog
pipes up, "I'm really a beautiful princess and if you kiss me, I'll
stay with you for a week".  The programmer shrugs his sholders and puts
the frog in his pocket.

A few minutes later, the frog says "OK, OK, if you kiss me, I'll give
you great sex for a week".  The programmer nods and puts the frog back
in his pocket.

A few minutes later, "Turn me back into a princess and I'll give you
great sex for a whole year!".  The programmer smiles and walks on.

Finally, the frog says, "What's wrong with you?  I've promised you
great sex for a year from a beautiful princess and you won't even kiss
a frog?"  "I'm a programmer," he replies.  "I don't have time for
sex....  But a talking frog is pretty neat."

Subject: RE: #2 Original Chest Cartilage

Got any plans to enlist the help of others to track down lost subscribers?

Alumni associations circulate lists of the lost.  But do some subscribers
hope to keep it a deep dark secret?

 Longtime reader AHM has a good point, but I have no idea what to do
 about it.  I have purged the list of about 400 names.  In most cases
 it was clear the addresses no longer existed, but with that many
 errors I thought I had to plow ahead and try to get down to a list I
 could live with.  That means many lost subscribers.  I could put
 together a list of the lost, but I'm tired of fooling with it.  I
 guess I'm dreaming that the lost will find their way back without my
 having spent days in Emacs sorting out old addresses.  I'm pretty
 sure most of the bad addresses are gone, so I'd like to just get down
 to compiling these things and stop removing names for awhile.  Too
 much psychic pain in purging.

&gt;From a Technology Review (7/93) article on sophisticated uses of
databases for personalizing junk mail:

One clever marketer for an anti-aging cream compiled a list of likely
prospects and mailed out ads with before-and-after pictures with a
note scrawled across the top along the lines of "Kathy--Try this.  It
works.  R."  A recently divorced woman, convinced that the note came
from her ex-husband's new wife, murdered them both.

In the CS department here there has been a joke going around that is supposed
to have come from one of Microsoft's software developers.  It has reference
to Ford's 'Quality is Job 1' slogan.  At Microsoft:
        'Quality is Job 1.1'

Like other kinds of intelligence, the storyteller's is partly natural,
partly trained. It is composed of several qualities, most of which, in
normal people, are signs of either immaturity or incivility: wit (a
tendency to make irreverent connections); obstinacy and a tendency toward
churlishness (a refusal to believe what all sensible people know is true);
childishness (an apparent lack of mental focus and serious life purpose; a
fondness for daydreaming and telling pointless lies, a lack of proper
respect, mischievousness, an unseemly propensity for crying over nothing);
a marked tendency toward oral or anal fixation or both (the oral
manifested by excessive eating, drinking, smoking and chattering; the anal
by nervous cleanliness and neatness coupled with a weird fascination with
dirty jokes); remarkable powers of eidetic recall, or visual memory (a
usual feature of early adolescence and mental retardation); a strange
admixture of shameless playfulness and embarrassing earnestness, the
latter often heightened by irrationally intense feelings for or against
religion; patience like a cat's; a criminal streak of cunning;
psychological instability; recklessness, impulsiveness and improvidence;
and finally, an inexplicable and incurable addiction to stories, written
or oral, bad or good.  Not all writers have exactly these same features,
of course.  Occasionally one finds one who is not abnormally improvident.

 Of course, the same words could be appplied to blues singers.

 Stories are all we have.

 How about sending contributions to tompar@world.std.com instead of
 replying?  It will cut down the amount of cutting down I have to do.
 However, I'll continue to cull from everywhere, mangling the credits,
 but saving the stories.
