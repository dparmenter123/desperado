The November 1994 surflist archive

from 11.16.94
Here is a short surfing list from last night's insomnia.  I've been asked to
give the list a wider distribution.  If you don't want it, send me mail or
just flush it.

Steve Crandall

======
Allegro is a record distributor.  There are a few audio files to download and
a catalog

        http://www.teleport.com/~allegro/

======
Sony's site is changing every week.  They are focusing on the music component,
but there are placeholders for films, electronic publishing and consumer
products.  This is a good example of passive advertising at ethernet rates
(awful from home at POTS rates!)

An interesting note is that they intend to sell over the Internet when
transactions become "secure".  You would sample a track, decide you wanted the
full CD, make the transaction and receive the CD via overnight delivery for
less than Sam Goodies price.

        http://www.music.sony.com/

=======
The ALIS Control Center
ALIS is the Auroral Large Imaging System - an array of ccd cameras that
populate a 50 x 50km grid in Northern Sweden for the study of auroras.
It is still under development, but there are some stunning images when
auroras are present. (check station 7 in Kilvo today for example).
Running these through your favorite image processing program can pull out
very interesting detail.

        http://snake.irf.se/
=======
Pollitical Satire from the Capitol Steps.  They attack both sides.  Full
songs to download, pointers to Gore's comics (and speculation that the WH
server doesn't point to them:-)

http://pfm.het.brown.edu/people/mende/steps/index.html
=======
IBM's home page for their new Internet service.  Surprisingly well
thought-out.We're planning to have a subset of this ready in about 8 months.

        http://www.ibm.net
=======
Tweeds - a catalog front for a conservative women's fashion catalog.  They
take orders via an 800 number

        http://www.shopping2000.com/shopping2000/tweeds/
=======
Sundance -- hyper-yuppie stuff from Rober Redford

        http://www.enet.net/serv/sundance/store/store_home.html
=======
Tower Records -- access to their catalog as well as 50 or so 10 second cuts
from "featured" albums

        http://www.shopping2000.com/shopping2000/tower/
=======
Sticking with the shopping2000 store front, REI has put their catalog on the
Internet

        http://www.shopping2000.com/shopping2000/rei/
=======
DEC's technical journal.  I haven't seen this before.. Digital has their
tehcnical journal on line..

        http://www.digital.com/info/DTJ/dtj.html
=======
Paper Direct -- my wife uses this place for her home business.  It was
surprising (perhaps not though) to find them on the Internet

        http://www.imn.net/paperdirect/index.html
=======
For you ham radio operators, AMSAT has a site

        http://www.qualcomm.com/amsat/AmsatHome.html
=======
The British Tourist Authority

        http://www.interactive.line.com/british.html
=======
A random collection of events in the US

        http://www.interactive.line.com/travelers/cover.html
=======
Oxford Books on line.  This looks promising (they claim about 300k titles),
butnone of the URLs in their page seem to work (they have an underconstruction
note)  It is probably worth a visit later:

        http://www.ping.com/oxford/main.htm
=======
Catalog Mart
Subscribe to a huge number of catalogs and crush the US postal service or
fuel your fireplace

        http://catalog.savvy.com/
=======
Chocolate
Pointers to a half dozen cholocate providers
        http://www.ios.com/~shag/chocolate.html
=======
EE Times

        http://techweb.cmp.com/eet/
=======
Montana Public Televsion
&gt;From MSU in Bozeman (I'm from Montana, so I'm partisan)  They claim to have a
T1 connection, which would put them near the top of media capabilities.

        http://www.kusm.montana.edu/
======
Probably something to sell high bandwidth into homes with prepubescent males -
skateboarding videos
        http://enternet.iuma.com/skate/video.html
=======
The University of Ill has some classes on the Web.

        http://www.uiuc.edu/webclasses.html

Pointers to some servers (some are slow/mean servers) with pretty pictures of
minerals
        http://www.rahul.net/infodyn/rockhounds/rockhounds.html
=======
CBC
The major shortwave providers (BBC, CBC and VOA) seem to be getting into
the Internet business.  The parallel between a shortwave listener and an
Internet surfer is probably close.

        http://town.hall.org/Archives/radio/Mirrors/CBC/cbc.html

=======
Student newspaper 0- Vocal Point
A student newspaper from Boulder Colorado.  I believe this was put up wiht
help from a GIS MTS.

        http://bvsd.k12.co.us/cent/Newspaper/Newspaper.html
Surfing note from 11.17.94              Steve Crandall
========
Classified ads -- 6 lines for 90 days cost $10.  There is very little there
now:

        http://www.shore.net/olm/
=======
Biological, Agricultural and Medical resources on the Internet.  I was pointed
to this by a friend who is a wheat farmer back in Montana!

        http://lib-www.ucr.edu/bioag/
=======
Comet Halley Stuff

If you want to look at the some of the data gathered between 81 and 89 during
the Halley's Coment return, here is an overview repository summarizing data
available on 18 CD ROMs  (along with information on how to get the CD ROMs -
sure to be best sellers:-)

        http://eyes.gsfc.nasa.gov/
=======
SL-9 collision
The top 20 images of the SL-9 event last Summer are available from:

        http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/top20.html
=======
Comets!
For the serious amateur interesting in observing comets ... light curves,
ephemerides, recent observations, etc.

        http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/
=======
HST home page
Can't afford that nice Celestron or Meade?  Your tax dollars are paying for
a real telescope -- the Hubble Space Telescope.  This site has released
images, education kits, etc...

        http://www.stsci.edu/OPO.html
=======
Ring around the Planet
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have ring systems.  Here is a home
page with information on planetary rings.  There has been considerable effort
in the past decade attempting to understand these beasts.  Some good stuff.

        http://ringside.arc.nasa.gov/
=======
More aurora stuff
Unlike the Sweidsh observatory, this site publishes recent sightings (hours
old) as well as geomagnetic forcasts -- much nicer than waiting for WWV at
14 minutues (or whenever they do the geomagnetic forecast) after the hour..

        http://www.geo.mtu.edu/weather/aurora/
=======
How deep can you get?
The Ocean Drilling Program -- the largest collaboration in the Earth Sciences.
Lots of interesting looking stuff.

        http://tam2000.tamu.edu/~odp/
=======
Timeline
Do you confuse the Silurian with the Devonian?  This handy geological timeline
will help get you straight.  (Believe it or not, this will be useful to me
as my wife is heavily into fossils -- (not a reflection on me, I hope:-))

        gopher://wiretap.spies.com/00/Library/Document/geologic.tbl
=======
Skakey Ground
When the Earth moves, you usually get a report from Caltech.  This is the
homepage for their seismology lab with very recent data. There are pointers
to the major observatories of the world.  Neat site.

        http://www.gps.caltech.edu/seismo/seismo.page.html
=======
Technology Review
For the MIT folks -- Technology Review

        http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena/org/t/techreview/www/tr.html
=======
Perforations
A magazine that "developes different themes of comtemporary life as they
relate to technology."  One issue is "After the Book: Writing Literature/
Writing Technology."  I haven't read enough of it yet to see if they have
any insight..

        http://noel.pd.org/perforations/perforations.html
=======
GFX
An online magazine from RPI. -- some PC and Internet news.

Surf report for the morning of 11.21.94

The Yahoo hierarchy went through 20,000 entries on Friday!

Surfing notes from the early morning of 11.22.94

Steve Crandall
=======

Some of the classics - The Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid.  There are larger
repositorie
s, but this one claims that it will focus on the things that you tried to
avoid in your Western Civilization classes as a Freshman...

        http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~joelja/classics.html
=======
The Bookzone claims to specialize in obscure books.  They have highlighted a
few books and provide slip jacket notes, a table of contents, and the first
paragraph.  The selection isn't large, but it does live up to its obscure
billing.

        http://www.ttx.com/bookzone
=======
Laser discs, CD Roms etc..  This site offers all of this stuff and, although
still under construction, has a large laser disc section. The prices seem
similar to some discount prices I've seen and they offer free shipping for
large orders.

        http://funstuff.com/
=======
Booze on the Web --- 800 Spirits.

        http://owl.net/OWLspace/spirits/800.spirits.html
=======
The Electronic Telegraph offers its paper to folks on the Web.  You have to
register with them.  Once registered, they give you am eight digit PIN.  The
problem is that this is catching on at several sites and I now have a
piece of paper with a half dozen PINs on it.

Grumbling aside, the layout is reasonable, with news summaries as well as
the full text of the articles.

        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/

=======
This has been around for awhile, but much of the serious construction is
now complete.  The San Jose Mercury Times.

http://mosaic.sjmercury.com/today.html

There are ads on some of the pages and some features are only available on
a subscription basis.
=======
British Telecom is getting into the Internet business.  They explain some of
their services and offer a mechanism to register for more information.  Not
a well-done site, but BT is certainly a major player.  They also seem to be
pushing ISDN.

        http://www.bt.net/
=======
If you have registered for Hotwired, check out the Club Med section
        http://www.hotwired.com/Coin/Spnsrs/Clubmed/
for an example of excessive giffage
=======
Uprise designs has "strange" tshirts and is notable as they claim to have the
ultimate in "geekware"

        http://arthole.com/OED/shirts.html
=======
SWISH
Information on an indexing system (Simple Web Indexing System for Humans).  It
looks like it is public domain and claims to be easy to use

        http://www.eit.com/software/swish/swish.html

and Word Perfect.

Here's something for the kids.  Rather than X rated sites, why not give them
a list of books that have been banned for one reason or another?  Maybe this
approach would get some of them interested in literature...

Here are some surfing comments from 11.26.94

Steve Crandall

===

Playboy -- it had to happen.  They've been there for awhile with a catalog,
but now they are putting content on their webserver.  This is a method to
get their stories and interviews if you are offended by the pictures.
Notable this month is a Bill Gates interview for those of you who are into
the "Cult of Bill"

======
Swiss Telecom -- for those interested in PTTs

        http://gdv015.vptt.ch/

I don't know what was slower -- my 14.4 line or their server... They claim
to offer ATM and ISDN in switzerland.  They also have a page on their R&amp;D
dept.
=======
White Rabbit toys.  High end/typically European toys to spoil your kids

"Adult" replacement for a 900 line.  It looks like you use their software and

good ad for Unix boxes and Macs...
