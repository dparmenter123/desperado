Hi, Desperado! This is Tokyo Rose. (I bought Bohn's password from IBM.)

I'm so sad that your company has taken your raise away and isn't telling you
the truth about it. What they really mean is two things: "Don't
bother resigning in protest, nobody's hiring," and "Everyone else is afraid of
Japanese competition and suffering from the recession. They aren't paying
their people. We could, but now we don't have to." You didn't get much
analysis of Digital's finances, now did you? Maybe they'd like to take your
raise money and build another work-the-issues-off-line facility in Stow.

Don't be a sucker, GI. Don't let your government sacrifice you. You could
be home eating Christmas dinner instead of getting sick out here. Our Japanese
soldiers aren't afraid of the jungle; they live there.

                TIMES are TOUGH! (or are they?)

        These are some facts about some DIGITAL Sales Force "meetings"
        that took place at the Merrimack Hilton last week.   We were
        wondering how everyone feels about a little woods meeting like this
        (Fancy dinner, open bar, the entire dining room and casino tables)
        in the same week our salary freezes were announced.

        I suppose motivating out sales force is a good way to get sales
        up and pull the company thru these tough economic times, but
        really.......  ask your friends?

Subj:   money

The total bill for the four days that DIGITAL was at the Hilton was
somewhere around $52,000.  Though this figure includes the rooms, the
total room bill was only around $10,000 I'm sure.  The company gave the
hotel a money order or something like that and said here you go, guys
spend it however you want to give the people a good time.  The Hilton
rented all the casino tables and the models from Cinderella modeling
agency.  Must be rough to have to spend that kind of money for
something like that!

Subject: "YOUR BENEFITS AT DIGITAL" -- watching money go up in $moke

I received my benefits packet today in the mail.  In light of the recent
announcement regarding salaries and freezes, it certainly feels like having
someone rub salt in the wound when I look at the package outlining my
benefits.  I heard an estimate that it cost in the area of $100 to produce
each of these elegant (and useless) packages.

I would be quite satisfied to have my benefits copied on newsprint and see
a few extra dollars in my check.  If money is so tight, why throw it away
on trivialities?  I understand that times are tough economically, but I'd
rather not be insulted by things like this while I "bite the bullet."

Maybe we should be biting the benefits package.  Something's rotten in
Denmark.

In exactly 24 hours, I intend to THROW AWAY a perfectly good KSR-33
Teletype terminal, with documentation.  I already have four terminals
at home, and my apartment is too small.   The KSR-33 is the kind without
the paper tape punch, unfortunately, but a relic is a relic.

If you, or anyone you know, can't bear the thought of a perfectly good relic
hitting the trash, get in touch with me via mail (KERMIT::TARDIFF) or
phone (DTN 264-8296) before Tuesday at noon -- the thing is free to the
first person who gets to me in time.

Tom, you can send this around to the DESPERADOS, but please don't attach my
my name to it.  I prefer to go silently.  This bumper sticker seen on
Route 3, en route to ZK:
