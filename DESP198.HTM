        This is the *real* 2028.  That so-called 2028 of last week was a
        fraud, phony, and imposter, clearly given away by the fact that
        it was correctly labelled 2027 by the publisher and was only labelled
        2028 by me.  If the publisher had followed established procedures,
        the subject line of the mail message would have been wrong too.

        Starting out strong, this issue.  Al Casey is a radio-controlled
        flyer.  His personal name is "THE DESERT RAT (I-RC-AV8)".  About a
        year ago I reprinted his signature, with cactus-and-rat terminal
        art.  Roy Orbison was also a radiaviator and Al got to know him
        through the hobby.  Al wrote a tribute to Roy for the RECORDS
        notesfile at DEC and I asked him if I could reprint it here.  His
        gracious reply follows, and then his eloquent tribute.

Subj:   RE: permission

Tom,

Thanx for the kind words.  Please feel free to share whatever replies I've
written on Roy.  I appreciate your asking permission but it wasn't really
necessary as my purpose for writing about Roy was to share this beautiful
person with the many friends he could never have met personally.

Adios,  Al

Well, it's been over 14-months since the tragic passing of Roy Orbison and,
at long last, I feel like talking about it.  The hurt has ebbed and I think
there may now be some therapeutic value in sharing what I know of the
circumstances surrounding Roy's untimely death.

On the night of December 6th, about 7:00PM MST, I received a call from Roy.
He'd just finished the Toledo concert and had returned to Hendersonville
(Tennessee) to relax and visit freinds and family before hitting the road
again.  Roy sounded really _UP_...I'd never heard him sound better; he and
his R/C (radio controlled model aircraft) buddy, Benny Birchfield, had been
"playing airplanes" for the past two days and just having a ball.

Roy said they'd spent the day flying, then browsing the local hobby shops and,
finally, visiting a nearby Air National Guard base to get some authentic
paint for an F-16 model he and Benny were finishing up.

We talked for more than a half-hour and Roy said he was _really_ ready for
a rest and planned to take several months off as soon as he returned from
England where another Travelling Wilburys video was to be taped.  He asked
for the dates of the R/C scale model extravaganza my modeling group, the
one-Eighth Air Force (of which Roy and Benny were honorary members), throws
twice annually and assured me he and Benny would definitely be attending.
This would have been in mid-March '89.

Roy then handed the phone to Benny who told me he was having a hard time
keeping up with "the Kid"...couldn't remember when he'd seen him looking
better or being in better spirits.  Benny said Roy'd been working harder
with his physical trainer lately and had lost 30-pounds.  Also, he'd had
the wattle beneath his chin "fixed" and Benny said Roy looked 20-years
younger.

We hung up and I felt great, as I always did after a call from Roy, really
looking forward to seeing him again in the Spring.  I hadn't seen him since
he invited me to be his guest at a special, private concert he gave the
previous May at a local swanky resort.

You can well imagine the terrific shock when I heard on the radio the very
next morning that Roy had died of a massive heart attack.  "It CAN'T be!" I
thought to myself, "I _just_ talked to him!!"  I was stunned!  Loss of
personal family members hadn't hurt much worse than this.  My wife said
that, sometimes, without being aware of it, people somehow sense impending
death and pick up loose ends, get things in order and contact close friends
one last time.  Her suggestion that I should be proud that I was one of the
last people Roy talked to helped...but somehow it didn't.

That night, after a _really_ rough day at work (I'd do OK 'til well meaning
folks would offer me their condolences, then I'd lose it), I called Benny
to find out what'd happened.  Benny, of course, was devastated but knew I
_needed_ to know so he shared the details with me.

After our phone call, Roy'd had dinner with Benny and his wife, Grand Ol'
Opry star, Jean Shepherd.  Jean had fixed a specialty rice dish of hers
and Benny said Roy really enjoyed it, having several extra helpings.  After
dinner, Roy went to his home (just a few blocks away) where his mother and
brother, Sammy, reside.  Benny said it'd barely been an hour (about 11:30PM
Hendersonville time) when he got a frantic phone call from Sammy saying,
"Come over quick!  Roy's passed out in the bathroon and we can't wake him up."

Benny and Jean rushed to Roy's home and Benny said the moment he saw him,
he knew Roy was gone.  Benny said he'd collapsed so suddenly he didn't even
brace himself for the fall, cutting his knee and forehead in the process.
Benny knew it was a bad sign that the cuts were not bleeding.  The
paramedics arrived right after Benny and worked on Roy for over a half-hour
before transposrting him to the hospital where doctors worked on him
another half-hour to 45-minutes.  The doctors told Benny the attack had
been so massive that they couldn't have saved Roy if he'd been afflicted right
there in the hospital!

I didn't attend the funeral in California but flew to Nashville and attended a
memorial service attended by Roy's closest friends, including Johhny Cash
and other celebrities.  I told Benny I felt out of place but he assured me I
had as much reason to be there as anyone in attendance which made me feel good.

A couple of weeks later, I wrote a letter to Roy's widow, Barbara, begging
she pardon my intrusion but hoping that expressing what Roy's frienship had
meant to me, just a Joe average, non-music business type, might help to
ease her grief.  I also expressed to Roy's sons how proud they should be that
their Dad had brought so much joy to just plain folks like me all over the
world.

Benny told me that Barbara had mentioned my letter to him and had said that
it helped to know that Roy had real friends outside the 'business.'  I was
surprised and very gratified to recieve a lovely note from Barbara some
while later.  The note included a touching sentiment written, supposedly,
by an unknown author.  However, from its content, I prefer to believe that
Roy himself might've written it...perhaps for Barbara, perhaps for all who
knew and loved him.  I'll share it with you here and let you be the judge:

                TO THOSE WHO LOVE AND
                THOSE WHO LOVE ME

        When I am gone, release me, let me go-
        I have so many things to see and do.
        You mustn't tie yourself to me with tears.
        Be thankful for our many beautiful years.

        I gave to you my love.  You can only guess
        How much you gave to me in happiness.
        I thank you for the love you each have shown
        But now it's time I traveled on alone.

        So grieve awhile for me, if grieve you must.
        Then let your grief be comforted by trust.
        It's only for a time that we must part
        So bless the memories within your heart.

        I won't be far away, for life goes on
        So if you need me, call and I will come.
        Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near
        And if you listen with your heart, you'll hear
        All my love around you soft and clear.

        And then, when you must come this way alone,
        I'll greet you with a smile and say-

                                Welcome home!

The note was signed, "Thank you for loving Roy,   Barbara Orbison."

I hope sharing this with those of you who were fans of "the Kid" will help,
as it helped me, to deal with the loss of "the man who had bells in his
throat."  He left me with _so_ many good memories...and not a single bad
one!  So long, Kid...I love you!

(TDR, not to be confused with time domain reflectometer)

If "#" is an octothorpe then it doesn"t take a big leap of faith to
assume that "*" is a hexathorpe.  And of course "+" is a quadrathorpe.
This being the case, then there must be names for other lesser known
"thorpes".  Naming becomes problematic because the name chosen must
reflect the true value and usage of a given thorpe.  For example, there
is a temptation to call a "o" a circular unithorpe, but the "." is, of
course the true unithorpe, albeit a "baseline unithrope".  This means
that the "o" must be something else and due to its resemblence to a
monocle it must be a monothrope.  This leaves all the other "thorpes"
out there to be named.  I have recently undertaken the Definitive
Thorpe Dictionary (DTD), not to be confused with Document Type Definition.

Among our recent entries are:
    #       -  octothorpe (also called the grandfather thorpe)
    *       -  hexathorpe
    +       -  quadrathorpe
    .       -  unithorpe
    -       -  horizontal duothorpe
    _       -  baseline duothorpe
    =       -  bifurcated dual duothorpe
    ~       -  sino-duothorpe (superior sino-duothorpe for tilde)
    !       -  baseline unithorpe superior vertical duothorpe
    @       -  archimedes monothorpe
    i       -  vertical duothorpe superior unithorpe
    o       -  monothorpe
    /\      -  ascending, descending duothorpe (credit D.Hall for this one)
    &amp; gclef -  left, right inebriated duothorpe
    :       -  dual vertical unithorpe
  ruleline  -  horizontal baseline megathorpe

Hi Tom,
        I was listening to NPR (That's National Public Radio for you
        non-hoity-toity types) this morning on the way to work when I
        heard this item: The city of Springfield Mass. has appointed
        a new harbormaster; of course as us Massachussetsians know,
        Springfield has no harbor! But that's O.K. the harbormaster in
        Springfield receives no salary.

        On a similar note: the town of Lake Los-Angeles CA. is voting
        on whether to change it's name since it has no lake, and is 100
        miles from Los-Angeles. Even if they change the name of the town,
        They will still be in Antelope County which, of course, has no
        antelope!

Such is life,
 - Mark

Subj:   sci.electronics excerpts

Well, this is certainly stupid.  It's also probably amusing to Hardware
types other than myself, though maybe they've all seen it before...

If you don't like long letters about wanton destruction and taking
stupid risks with one's personal health, you might as well hit D now.
If, on the other hand, you like the sort of stuff that Survival
Research Labs do, then this is for you.

What's that?  You don't read sci.electronics on a regular basis?  Well, no
need to miss out on all the fun that's been going down there recently!

No indeed.  Here, in fact, are some excerpts -- this seems to be a hot topic,
so watch sci.electronics for yet more fun stuff to do with all those broken
(or just breakable) things.

Does anyone out there have some firsthand experience in destroying various
electronic items for sick-minded amusement ? I would like to share some of
mine and hear from others.

CRT's   : From TV's/monitors. Wonderful implosions if dropped into an open
        manhole or thrown inside a storm-drain tunnel. Vociferous THUD. Must
        drop on face. 25" color tubes are the best ! Once i chucked one into
        a concrete ditch, face-first, with 1-1/2" water. IT DIDNT BREAK !

Light bulbs &amp; tubes : Similar to above, but have short POP followed by
                        tinkling sound of glass. Sometimes emit small cloud
                        of sparks if done in the dark. Light bulbs can be
                        subjected to perversely-higher-than-normal voltage
                        which results in the 'Xenon Effect'. Can also apply
                        normal voltage, allow to heat, and dunk in water;
                        makes a good 'Splort' sound.

Fluorescent tubes :  Best if thrown like a javelin. Very loud if stood
                     upright and allowed to fall on hard surface.

Capacitors      : Alltime favorite. Just make sure the applied voltage
                (usually 120 VAC) is 3+ times greater than the WVDC of
                the victim. Nice sparky explosion with smoke. One
                drawback to large (&gt;1000uF) caps is that they pop the
                circuit breaker. Especially nice if you have 220/50A
                service. DON'T USE 'AC' CAPACITORS UNLESS THEY ARE
                MARKED 'NO P.C.B.'S'. Polychlorinated Bi-phenyls (PCB's)
                are an extreme environmental hazard.

IC's            : Nice pop with good orange/blue flames. Static memory
                chips are the best.

Batteries       : If you are patient, alkaline and zinc-carbon cells are
                quite amusing. Best to use a variac rated at 10+ amps and
                adjust from 0-120 VAC. Fresh batteries smoke and sizzle,
                while 'dead' batteries put-out nice green/blue/orange
                fireworks along with ample amounts of smoke. One victim
                popped out of its case with a loud 'suction-cup' noise.
                Still to be investigated are lead-acid and NiCd species.

Resistors       : Up to 10K-ohms and under 1 watt are susceptible to 120VAC.
                Depending upon value, they will heat-up, discolor, smoke, and
                flame-out, sometimes with a pleasant 'Bzzzzzztttttt-Phuffff'
                sound.

Motors          : No luck so far. Have tried running 60hz 3450 RPM motor at
                about 190Hz (~11000 RPM). Really screams. Desired effect
                was to cause armature to fly apart. Problem is that higher
                frequency operation requires higher voltage. To be
                investigated further this summer.

                Special case: Vacuum cleaner motors can be placed over a
                shallow pan of gasoline and energized. Can get 6-8 foot
                flame tower. Water and salt-water doesn't produce desired
                effect.

Speakers        : Ignite while playing music by Twisted Sister. Can also
                connect to lo-freq (5-20Hz) oscillator and use as a 'shake
                table'. Once, while 'inebriated' in a microprocessor class
                at UCLA, I filled it with wine-cooler and gawked at the
                various patterns while the speaker was driven by a radio
                tuned to KMET (Ah, yes, the MIGHTY MET 94.7, now defunct
                thanks to yuppies).

Transformers    : Remove iron core, unwind and tie one end across street.
                Hold bobbin with screwdriver, et-al. Wait for car. Good
                vibrating WIZZZZZZZ shakes your whole body while it unwinds.
                Leftover 'E' cores make so-so judo stars.

&gt;Capacitors

   I have also had some fun with capacitors.  A few friends and myself once
made a kind of 'cannon' that had a capacitor mounted in one end.  When the
cap blew, the metal can would fly out like a projectile and go about 20-30
feet.  Destructive and wasteful, but fun.

&gt; Resistors

   I find that resistances around 100 ohms are optimum.  The larger the
wattage, (up to about 1 watt), the longer the wait, but the more spectacular
the results.
    I'll have to try the old batteries ....

        I once managed to knock something into a light bulb while it was
turned off.  Shattered the glass envelope but left the fillament intact.
Figured I would see what happened if I turned it on.  Hint: There *is* a
reason why they bother going to the trouble of enclosing the fillament in
an inert gas.

&gt; Fluorescent tubes

        I once had a temporary job when I was in high school helping out at
a tennis club changing light bulbs.  It was an indoor club, with the courts
in a very high (40-50 ft?) ceiling structure, with banks of flourescent
tubes up top.  Changing the tubes is a bitch, so they wait until a fair
percentage are out, then change them all.  We had a mobile scaffolding, on
which we climbed to take out the old tubes and put in new ones.  The surface
of the courts was that composition stuff; not what you'd call soft, but a
lot softer than concrete or even asphalt.  It's amazing what happens when
you drop a tube from that height.  The tube is fairly light for its cross
section so it reaches terminal velocity pretty fast and sort of floats down,
wobbling a bit.  It probably only takes a second or so to hit, but it seems
like a *lot* longer.  Then you hear this little *pong* and in place of the
tube there are zillions of bits of glass and a little cloud of dust.  It's
really pretty surrealistic.

&gt; Capacitors

        Take a big electrolytic, the kind about the size of a can of
Fosters, with the big screw terminals on top.  Say 450,000 uF at 35V.  If
you don't have one handy, there are probably some in the power supply of
that 11/780 in the machine room that won't be missed. :-) Charge it up good,
to about the rated voltage.  Now you've got a couple of dozen coulumbs just
waiting to to find some conducting surface.  Like your neighbor's metal desk
top, or the wall of an elevator.  Be creative.

CRTs: satisfactory results can be achieved by placing these on a hard
surface, flat side up, and dropping forged metal objects on them from
heights exceeding ten meters (lower heights result in poor performance
-- nothing but a gradual cracking).

A most satisfactory bang can be had by placing a TV picture tube (19"

the parking lot, dusting it liberally with talcum powder or gypsum, and
throwing an axe at it.

For best results, use a Porsche or Mercedes.

From: BITNET%"EIEB360@UTXVM.BITNET" 27-FEB-1990 13:41:45.05
Subject: LETTER TO _ACADEMIC COMPUTING_
Date:         Tue, 27 Feb 90 08:46:50 CST

MBUERS, COMMENTS WILL BE MUCH APPRECIATED!

     In "Student Writing: Can the Machine Maim the Message?" (Academic
Computing 4 [January 1990]), Marcia Peoples Halio of the University of
Delaware reports that freshman writing students produced consistently
poorer essays using Macintosh computers than their peers working in
facilities equipped with MS-DOS computers.  She attributes the difference
in the quality of student writing to differences between the computers
themselves, and specifically to the difference between the Macintosh's
graphical interface and the character-based, command-line interface of the
MS-DOS machines.  Her own experience, along with that of four instructors
who taught on both Macintoshes and IBMs during the Fall 1988 semester,
"seems to demonstrate," she says, that "using the Mac or the IBM could have
[a significant] effect on students' writing" (17).

     As we shall indicate below, Halio's article is seriously flawed by
methodological and interpretive errors; it would likely have been forgotten
had it appeared elsewhere. Publication in Academic Computing has given it
wide circulation, however, not only among faculty members involved with
writing instruction, but among administrators responsible for purchasing
equipment for their campuses: its potential impact is therefore
considerable.

     This letter grows out of discussions taking place over a BITNET
discussion loop called Megabyte University (moderated by Fred Kemp at Texas
Tech University) between ]DATE 1] and [DATE 2].  Megabyte University
"enrolls" some 70 people interested in writing instruction; these include
faculty members and graduate students from universities and colleges across
the United States; approximately a dozen members became involved in the
discussion of Halio's article.  Participants were at first inclined to
dismiss the article as trivial, until faculty members participating both in
Megabyte University and in another loop called HUMANIST, with some 600
members in 20 countries (edited by Willard McCarty at the University of
Toronto) reported receiving photocopies of Halio's article from deans and
other administrators, with comments to the effect that Halio has "proved"
the inferiority of the Macintosh as a machine for writing instruction.
These reports have persuaded us that we should explain the problems that
seem to us so evident to other readers of Academic Computing.  We do not
seek to demonstrate that Halio is wrong; our point is that it's not at all
clear what the University of Delaware experience demonstrates, and that far
more careful study is necessary.

     The evidence Halio offers consists of her own qualitative observations
about the writing of her students and those of several other instructors,
as she believes them to have been "confirmed" (18) by the Writer's
Workbench text analysis program's Style module; she also cites the remarks
of four unidentified instructors who responded to a query from her.  Halio
also quotes at length from three student papers produced on the Macintosh
(17).  They are indeed poorly written, though they might have been much
worse without deserving the public trashing Halio gives them (17).
Furthermore, since much of Halio's contempt is directed at the topics
chosen by Macintosh users (17), one wants to know how two of these students
came up with identical topics ("American Eaters") if they were given only
the general "writing suggestions" Halio describes (17).

     Direct comparison of these examples with sample essays produced on IBM
computers would have been extremely helpful, but Halio offers no samples of
writing done on an IBM.  Instead, she uses results obtained from Writer's
Workbench to make her case against the Macintosh.  Macintosh users wrote
"fewer complex sentences" than IBM users, used more "to be" verbs, and
wrote shorter sentences; their essays also received lower scores on the
Kincaid readability scale- - 7.95 for Mac users, as opposed to 12.1 for
students writing on the IBM.  These results, says Halio, "confirmed [her]
initial impressions" (18); but they do not necessarily mean what she says
they do.

     The Writers' Workbench Style program supplies a great deal of
information about a piece of text, but its analyses have only about eighty
percent accuracy, and much of its output can be confusing to those who
don't know how to interpret it.  Three of Halio's Writers' Workbench
measurements are suspect even if the program's information is accurate:

     (a) Readability scores are just that--measures of
     readability-- not of writing ability. In general, a
     high readability score means that the writing is hard
     to understand.  Clear business writing and general
     magazine writing, for instance, normally score from 8
     to 10 on the Kincaid scale, not 12.1.

     (b) Sentence length, as Halio says, is related to
     readability.  Most writers of non-technical prose
     average about 16-20 words per sentence.  Many style
     analysis programs would reject the 22.6-word average
     that Halio cites as desirable.

     (c) "To be" verbs are too high in both samples that
     Halio cites.  Even the 23 percent scored by IBM users
     in Halio's sample exceeds the 15 to 19 percent usually
     found in professional writing.

Thus it is not clear that students using the IBM really did produce
significantly better papers than those using the Macintosh.  Certainly
these data offer no grounds for concluding that the differences have been
caused by the computers the students were using.

     Halio provides a similarly misleading description of the Delaware
student population, saying only that "all students in the computer sections
[of Delaware's freshman writing course] have roughly comparable levels of
writing ability" "because their SAT scores as well as the results of a
placement essay have put them in the medium writing- ability range (they
did not qualify for the Honors Program, nor were they placed in the
remedial sections)" (17).  This "medium writing-ability range" is a good
deal wider than Halio implies (one presumes, for instance, that instructors
felt justified in using the full grading scale to delineate differences
among individual students).  A more useful study would provide detail about
the students and their backgrounds and the attitudes toward writing they
brought with them into the classroom-- in other words, information about
the factors influencing the students' classroom performance and, indeed,
their initial choice of which sections to take.  Detailed information about
the students' racial, ethnic, and class affiliations, about their gender,
and (not least, in this context) about their previous experience with
computers is crucial to an informed evaluation of the differences Halio
says she observed in student writing.  Halio says that students were free
to choose between Macintosh- or IBM-based sections of the freshman writing
course; and it's precisely because the students were free to choose that we
need to know so much more about them and the reasons for their choices.

     Finally, a reliable study would provide specific information about
Delaware's writing curriculum, and about the ways in which computers are
integrated into the composing process and the curriculum generally.   Halio
says nothing about the curriculum, however, and she implies that students
are left to figure out for themselves how best to use the computers for
writing: "after approximately one and one-half hours of instruction, they
then work to improve their computer skills from self-paced handouts
prepared by our Academic Computing Support services. They use the public
sites on their own time to write their papers" (17; emphasis added).  This
may be enough training for students to learn the basic elements of word
processing, though even that depends in large part on their familiarity
with word processing and the particular word processing package involved,
which Halio does not identify (at the University of Texas at Austin, for
instance, the Union Microcenter offers Beginning, Intermediate, and
Advanced courses on both MS-DOS and Macintosh versions of Microsoft Word,
each an hour and a half long.)  But there is a considerable difference
between using a word processor to enter and manipulate text which has
already been composed, and using the word processor as a fundamental part
of the composing process.  Even trained, professional writers making the
transition from pen and legal pad or typewriter to word processor require
considerably longer than an hour and half's training to integrate the word
processor completely into their methods of composition.

     Halio has raised serious questions about the possible impact of
hardware and software design upon students and others who use computers to
write, and her evident desire to focus our attention on potentially serious
problems is laudable.  It is incumbent upon all of us to consider these
questions.  But in rushing prematurely to publication rather than waiting
for the results of the "more carefully controlled experiment" she says she
is now conducting (45), Halio has acted irresponsibly-- and so has Academic
Computing.

Re Marcia Peoples Halio, the mail says that students were allowed to
choose their own word processor.  Did it occur to Halio or Forbes that
people's choice of word processor could be correlated with other
traits that are correlated with writing ability?  To put it crudely,
perhaps the ones who wrote about Heavy Issues ones chose IBM PCs
because they already learned how to use them, the better to run their
spreadsheets with and prepare for their lives as investment bankers,
whereas ones who wrote about popular culture chose whatever was
easiest to learn.

The tendency of people to find clear causality in the most anecdotal
of evidence is astounding.

At least the former group of students has learned the important lesson
that to get high regard from your teacher, you should pick a topic
that your teacher thinks is interesting and important, rather than one
that you think is interesting and important.

My own writing habits,  established many years ago using two fingers
on a manual typewriter, weathered the transition to touch typing using a
"programmer's editor" (as word-processor enthusiasts call them)
completely unchanged.  I always wrote as if I had a DELETE key, arrows,
cut and paste, and all.  I used to cut and paste all the time.  My
practice was to correct all typos as I made them, using Whiteout,
Correctape, and white correcting tape.  My aim was to have the first
draft be the equivalent of a second or third draft by refusing to move
forward until I was happy with what I had.  If an error was on the top
half of the page, I fixed it with technology.  If it was on the bottom
half of a page, I cut it off and typed a new bottom half.  (Yes, I know,
that was technology too.)  I once actually documented my practice by
saving every single piece of paper that resulted from writing a chapter
of a book I was working on.  It took approximately three pieces of paper to
produce one finished manuscript page.  I once scraped a teaspoonful of
sticky white Correctype powder out of the guts of my good old Royal
office model.

And, my years of EDT, Zmacs, XLSE, Xywrite, and LSE notwithstanding, the
Royal is still in perfect working condition, covered and lubed, ready for
the post-atomic-war era, if I need it.  I guess I should store some
Correctype, correcting tape, Scotch tape, and scissors too.

Subject: Service Interaction

This was in a letter from a friend of mine who works at microsoft.  I
thought it would be a good example of what feature interaction can
actually do. . .

A particularly insidious kind of sales call now appearing in several
cities is one which is initiated by computer, and contains recorded
questions by some mellifluous voice that requires answers in simple
digits or "yes" and "no". A voice recognition circuit then processes
your answers and asks further questions based on your former answers.
The sales pitch is usually disguised as a survey of some kind.
The despicable thing about these things is that they won't leave you
alone. If you hang up, they will just call back again.

One day my wife got a call from one of these computer systems, and her
answering machine answered. The conversation that followed was
hilarious, as it consisted of two machines talking to each other
without having the slightest idea about what each other was saying.
The conversation wound up in an endless loop, as follows:

[PHONE] *RING*

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "...At the tone, please give your message.
BEEEEEP."

[PHONE] "Hello. This is [company_name], and we are taking a telephone
survey ... when I ask a question, wait for the beep, then please
speak plainly.  I will repeat your answer back to you, and verify it.
First, what is your phone number? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

(The answering machine, upon hearing the beep, got confused and thought

it was a play-back command, and generated another beep in response.)

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[PHONE] "Thank you! Your phone number was 443-28347-47756-377764-22222.
Is that correct? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any children? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[PHONE] Thank you! What is the age of your first child? BEEEEEEEEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[PHONE] "Your first child is 1,222 years old. Is that correct?
BEEEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[---------------  BEGIN ENDLESS LOOP ----------------]

[PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any more children? BEEEEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[PHONE] "Thank you! What is this child's age? BEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[PHONE] "This child is 4,233 years old. Is that correct? BEEEEP."

[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

[---------------------END LOOP -----------------------]

My wife, upon noticing that the answering machine had been going for
over half an hour, turned up the volume to find out what was going on.
When she discovered this endless loop (by now she had over 200 children,
all over 1,000 years old), she switched off the answering machine. The
computer never called again.

In case any of you thought you were a bad influence on me (not that I
think you are), this anecdote proves that being a moral bad influence is
just one of the many services now provided by our state and local
governments.

Do you remember those "Make it in Massachusetts" bumper stickers from a
few years back?  Blue with white lettering and a white fist with the
thumb up?  Seen on the back of an official Arlington Sewer and Water
Division truck this morning, was one that had been skillfully altered,
probably with a razor blade.  The inscription read "Wak it in
Massachusetts" and as for what the fist was doing, well....

Re: Desperado # 2027

I believe that I can answer half of Tom Carlin's question about
panties and other forms of underwear:  Ladies' panties are the
direct descendant of ladies' drawers, which consisted of two
tubular portions, one for each leg, drawn (hence the name) together
at the top by a drawstring.  I suspect that the singular usage for
brassiere comes from an unwillingness to allude to the actual part
of the anatomy covered by that article of clothing.  Americans use
the French word for "arm covering", while the French call them
"un couvre-coup", literally "neck covering."  Obviously, one has
only one neck, n'est-ce pas?

Didactically yours,

Well, actually, as you say, Tom, George Carlin did, but who's counting?

&gt; The deadline is over, but wotthehell, free the things.  And, while you're
&gt; at it, seek the answer to George Carlin's question:  "How come it's a
&gt; *pair* of panties but *a* brassiere?"

I've always speculated that it might be because we are dealing with an
entity that has two distinct parts, a front and a back, as opposed to
an entity that has (in essence) only a front.  Well, two fronts,
actually, but that's a 1920s term, and we know those people were all
fouled up on spirits manufactured in the enamel of their own homes or,
if not there, in the parlor of the nearest medium.  Didja ever notice
how those practitioners never called themselves smalls or larges?

(Actually, I don't think I ever speculated about this topic before,
either.)

in re the ejaculation in your first line, tom, might I assume that you
are a follower of the doings of archy and mehitabel?

The back and front theory is wrong, wrong, wrong.  Actually, Dick AND
"Mom", as you recall, Pantalone is a commedia del'arte character - a
skinny old dotard, they say - who wore tight trousers.  From that,
circuitously, a pant, of which he wore one on each leg, constituting a
pair, itself an old term for a coordinated set, not necessarily two, as
in a pair of scissors, which happens to be two, but the dictionary has "a
pair of beads", while a brassiere is clearly a single garment, invented,
as you say, in modern times, to *conceal* women's breasts, strangely
enough, a plan since abandoned in favor of using the brassiere in
coordination with the darts in the front of a blouse for a smooth,
ladylike look.

The theft of a dozen priceless art objects from the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum was quite a shock, but not to worry - the FBI is on the job. From an
AP article about the case:

        "The FBI searched the world Monday for the ancient Chinese vase
         and 11 paintings and drawings by artists such as Rembrandt,
         Degas and Vermeer taken early Sunday from the museum."

Struck by the elegance of the sentence, it took me a few moments to appreciate
just how fine a job our FBI is doing - and to wonder what they're going to
search on Tuesday.

This robbery was right out of the beloved Batman comics of my youth:  midnight
raid on an idiosyncratic museum by clever thieves dressed as cops.  The current
so-called  Batman is a nut, however, and not a very nice one.

    If this decade and century and millennium business weren't bad enough, I've
    just been informed that the frog-eating French say "dix jours" (10
    mornings) when they mean a week and "quinze jours" (15 mornings) when they
    mean two weeks.

"Jour" means "day" in French.  "Morning" is "matin".

It's a ravishingly beautiful language.  Please don't ravage it.

Subj:   Truth in defaming

 &gt; The Japanese trained pyromaniac bats to burn California houses in
 &gt; WWII.  Several forest fires ensued from bats bearing bombs released
 &gt; from subs offshore.  And of course, the US Navy thinks it's peachy to
 &gt; send bomb-bearing porpoises off on purpose.  Eviles of war.  They
 &gt; should only kill people, not unoffending animals.

This is clearly apocryphal; the facts turned on their head.  A Harvard
chemistry professor invented napalm during WWII.  It was put to
significant use in flame throwers.  Other more imaginative uses were
considered.  One was to equip bats with small napalm-charged incindiary
devices.  The bats were cooled, which sent them into hybernation.
They were then to be flown over Japanese cities (with their
hyper-inflammable construction), and dropped from planes.  The bats
would wake up when they hit warmer near-ground air temperatures, and
fly to usual bat-beloved places, like under the eaves of buildings;
then delayed timers would ignite the charge.  There were fairly
serious field tests, but it didn't quite add up, and was never
deployed.  The story put forward in =D= doesn't add up.

        - B.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
No, it doesn't add up.  Occam's Razor shaved me too close on that one.  I
should have remembered the paper houses of Japan.  The bats were ours,
released by us, and flew into our own territory, and set us on fire.

I just learned, by the way, that all the ladybugs sold to gardeners come
from one valley in a California, and that they are genetically programmed
to fly one mile up from their birthplace so they can be blown to the
other end of the valley.  When folks buy ladybugs to protect their
gardens from Kennebunkport to Tucumcari, these bugs fly one mile up and
are blown off into someone else's garden, or, so says last week's Wall
Street Journal.
