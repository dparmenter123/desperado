 Things may be clearing up for "Blue Sky".  The movie, the last made
 by Tony Richardson, went nowhere at the box office after languishing
 for four years behind the impenetrable wall of corporate collapse
 and Hollywood inability to see that Jessica Lange as a sexpot and
 Tommy Lee Jones as a driven hero (with the rascally Powers Booth
 completing the triangle) was a formula for a hell of a movie.  It's
 a love story of the 50s.  She's classically hot to trot and he stays
 with her because she brings him excitement.  As one of their
 daughters puts it, "She's crazy and he's blind."  Powers Booth, the
 CO, gets Tommy out of the way by sending him out to a nuclear test
 site (David gloms Bathsheba) where he witnesses two cowboys get
 caught in the fallout.  No one wants to know about it and when he
 gets back the CO locks him up in the mental ward.  And Jessica gets
 her butt in gear to get him out.  A great show and how that Jessica
 is likely for the Oscar, you may get another chance to see it.

Subject: A contribution to your august and delightfully bizarre periodical

While traipsing through my humor mail folder today I tripped across these two
slightly dated messages and thought of Desperado.  While over a year old, they
may still be entertaining to your readers.  The "product" in question is doing
quite well in the market and has develop numerous new features on its own -
including harrassing the cat, hiding in large urns and demanding stories be
read to it.  It is feared that she will become System 7.5 Savvy and start
demanding additional resources before her time.

[BTW, I have permission from the original author to share these with Depseradi
and he has encouraged inclusion of his compuserve address as well.]

Subj:   GROUT HOUSE NORTH ALERT!!!

PRESS RELEASE

Moved over newswire
11:30pm 27 January 1993

For immediate release

GROUT 2.1 IS ANNOUNCED

NEWTON, MA - Cliff and Ellen Grout of Grout House North have announced the
development of Grout 2.1, a new hardware extension that will be delivered
sometime in September.  Concieved as a private venture, Grout 2.1 will be a
one-of-a-kind unit initially relying on the primary processors, but will
eventually become a stand-alone system.  "We do not expect any delays
concerning the shipping date." said Ellen, who is in charge of product
development and project management.  No specs will be provided until the
release date.

Grout 2.1 will be System 7 savvy and fully Huggies compatible.

END OF RELEASE

[Sometime during the development cycle the product's first ultrasound scan and
circulated - sort of a contextual inquiry during the early development phase.
Based on the fuzzy round image of this nascent young'un, the product was
nicknamed "Grape".]

Subject: CMJ

Tom,

One  thing  you  might want to make clear to the desperado audience is that
the  CMJ that is sent to home subscribers is different than the one that is
sent  to  radio  stations.  The one that is sent to stations does come with
"Certain  Damage" CD's but the magazine content is every chart known to man
followed  by  about  a  dozen  pages  of  chart analysis, CMJ's "hot picks"
(strange,  nothing  EVER  gets  a  bad  review  in  CMJ),  industry  people
contributing  blurbs about why all their releases are really "hot", college
radio  music  directors  thanking  all  the industry reps who gave the most
"gifts"  (dinners with the stars, "hot" tickets, 20 copies of the new CD's,
T-shirts,  nifty  posters, whatever it takes to get your putrid band on the
playlist,   and   yes,   some  non-commercial  stations  do  have  playlist
requirements).  Oh  yes,  stuffed  in  the back is the "reporting" section,
where  radio  stations  list  their  top  20 for the two week period. Indie
companies  use  these  lists to figure out who should get their records. If
you  want  good  service,  you  need  to  report.  To  report,  you need to
subscribe, which runs your favorite college station several hundred dollars
a year.

So  if  you're wondering where your 10 cent track comes from, a chunk of it
came  from all us fools who want record service. (Of course, an even larger
chunk  comes from record companies who put their ads in this rag, luckily
none  of the labels I regularly purchase goods from fall into this category).

 You should know that Lisa loves music that scares the hell out of
 most people.  Yes, noted that CMJ, like so many capitalist
 institutions, rides on the backs of its customers.  That said, when
 the thing comes in the mail, I put it on and listen in the
 background.  Then I check off what I like and program the CD to put
 my choices on a tape.  The resulting tape has a more interesting
 playlist than any non-college station I might try.  It's not all
 heavy metal and rap, or even alternative.  I find lots of good
 mainstream music that anyone who likes three-chord rock&amp;roll would
 find entertaining.  I just don't buy CDs the way I used to buy
 records, and CMJ helps make up for the lousiness of radio even as it
 contributes to it.

                           Computer numbers

Many times people talk about kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
occasionally terabytes, and in the future you may be hearing about
petabytes; but some folks don't know what those are. Well, here are
the values:

    1 kilobyte =                        1,024  bytes (1,024**1)
    1 megabyte =                    1,048,576  bytes (1,024**2)
    1 gigabyte =                1,073,741,824  bytes (1,024**3)
    1 terabyte =            1,099,511,627,776  bytes (1,024**4)

And now the newest big number, the PETAbyte:

    1 PETAbyte =        1,125,899,906,842,624  bytes (1,024**5)

    I had to share this with you while it's still hot from the press --
yesterday the Social Actions office here at Hickam Air Force Base published
and distributed hundreds of copies of a "Human Relations Disparaging Terms"
pamphlet.  God knows how many man-hours (or wymyn-hours) went into its
production, but it's obviously the product of extensive research.  Social
Actions cites Webster's Third International Dictionary (1986) as the source,
and they thoughtfully offer the following caution on the cover: "Contains
terms which may be used or taken offensively." The list itself is entitled
"Slurs."  Without further ado, I give you the list in its entirety, leaving
out only the definitions (the truly motivated will beat a quick path to the
nearest Webster's).

    By the way, this is not the first "Human Relations Disparaging Terms"
pamphlet Social Actions has published -- last year's Table of Taboo Terms
included slurs inexplicably absent this time around: e.g., Dutch, Dutch
courage, going Dutch, fem, femme, female, four-eyes, and yellow (the
adjective, as opposed to the noun "yellowbelly").
    "Say, didn't they omit a few Disparaging Terms?" you ask.  Yes, even
the most casual slinger of slurs will note some gaps, and I won't bore you
by trying to list them.  But take "raghead," for example -- why isn't it
here?  After careful consideration, I've come to the following conclusion:
becoming an official Disparaging Term is akin to attaining sainthood.  An
offensive term has to have a long history, a pedigree as it were, before
the scholars at Social Actions will put it on The List.  Consider
"conventicler," if you will: a religious heretic who attends conventicles,
or secret meetings.  This word was last uttered in normal conversation
sometime in the 17th Century. "Campbellite," a follower of Alexander
Campbell, founder of the Disciples of Christ, is by contrast one of the
newer slurs on The List, and it is at least a hundred years old.  So you
see, these things take time.  Just as the Vatican beatifies candidates
before granting them sainthood, I imagine that Social Actions maintains a
list of Semi-Slurs, containing words which may someday attain full
Disparaging Termhood.  I fully expect to see "raghead" (not to mention
"camel jockey" and "sand monkey") hit the Big Time by, say, 2015.
    "So what about 'bastard' or 'slut?'" you ask -- Anglo-Saxon words that
have been around since the opposable thumb -- why aren't they on The List?
And if you can't call someone a "whoreson," is it okay to call someone a
"whore?"  Hey, these Social Actions people have college degrees!  I'm
certainly not going to argue with them.  But YOU can!  Call or write and
ask them why YOUR favorite slurs aren't on the list -- their number is
(808) 449-1701, and the address is 15 ABW/SL, Hickam AFB HI 96853.
