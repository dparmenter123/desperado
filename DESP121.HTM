 There have been a number of additions to the mailing list who have not seen
 "the definitive word" on DESPERADO.  We also like to send this intro out
 from time to time, anyway, just for fun.

 And, I'm going on vacation to sunny St. Barts for two weeks, so I thought
 I'd give you some reading till I get back and till Therry has a new issue
 ready to go out.                               /john

                      YOUR FIRST DESPERADO

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Here is the motto of Desperado, and also the conditions that prevail
(some might call them rules, but not me).

                               MOTTO

                I stay cool, and dig all jive,
                That's the way I stay alive.
                My motto, as I live and learn, is
                "Dig and be dug in return."

                                -- Langston Hughes

                                =*=

            OFTEN ROWDY, BUT NEVER RAW, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT

Somehow or other, your name has gotten added to the Desperado mailing
list.

Desperado is an electronic rag that I send around the net from time to
time to several hundred Digital desperados from Australia to Sweden,
and even in Marlboro.  Everyone on the list is there by request.
(There are also lots of forwards, secondary and tertiary desperados,
but I don't know about them.)

The thing consists of whatever interests me on the day I send it out.
It's about half humor, half rumor, and half miscellaneous
clusterdness.  Most of it is mail I've gotten from other people.  Some
of it is mail from me.  Feel free to comment on anything, but if you
want the original sender to hear your views, you should send them mail
direct, in addition to whatever you send to me.  I can't use everything
that's sent to me, but lots of discussions that start in Desperado
continue off line.

Everything in between strings of vertical bars (octal ASCII 174, | )
is written by me, along with the headlines, and all the pretty
decorations.

Desperado is designed to be scrolled a la' RSX, not paged a la' VMS.
If you get it on a VMS system, use the command EXTRACT TT: to get the
best-looking Desperado.  That way, you also get to see the VT100
escape treatments that I thoughtlessly include from time to time.

Submissions from NEMO:: are anonymous.  Most are from people who don't
want their names published for whatever reason. Sometimes I decide
that your name should be left off for your own protection.  Some
NEMO:: submissions are from me.

I don't forward everything that is sent in.  I rarely forward the
heavily forwarded stuff unless it's too good to pass up.  Except for
submissions from NEMO::, everything else in Desperado comes
approximately as is from the person who sent it, although I usually
try to correct spellings and grammar. Don't send me anything that
looks like you wrote it yourself unless you wrote it yourself.  As for
my part, I often cut submissions down, but I don't put words in your
mouth.  I do save everything interesting that comes my way, whether I
forward it or not. Information on these archives of network life is
available on request.

All known issues of Desperado can be viewed on Kermit, the home node.
The files all have titles like DESPNOV83.MAI or DESPDEC82.MAI.  The
oldest one is DESPJUL80.MAI (and our birthday is July 29, 1980).
Kermit has an account with the name DECNET and the password KERMIT.
(Bring on your industrial spies!)  RSX users can list the files using
a command in the following form:

        NFT TI:=KERMIT/DECNET/KERMIT::DB2:[303,5]DESPJUL80.MAI

VMS users can do the same with a command in the form:

        TYPE KERMIT"DECNET KERMIT"::DB2:[303,5]DESPJUL80.MAI

You can also copy the files, obviously.  Some of the files are pretty
long.  [This hasn't been working lately, but give it a try.  Maybe its'
fixed by now.]

I send out a Desperado when I can.  If you send me something with a
date or time in it, I may miss your deadline.  Too bad, huh?

Desperado is an underground benefit for DEC employes.  Don't forward
it outside, please.  It probably doesn't hurt to send a hard copy to
someone outside, but let's all be discreet.

It's usually not this boring.

The preceding program, which may have contained material not suitable for all
Digital employees, was written by our Founder, the original editor, the
inimitable Tom Parmenter, now grazing in the Elysian fields of Symbolics,
a Cambridge concern. The new staff is John Covert, a mail wizard of power,
who does the publishing, and Therry Neilsen-Steinhardt, a woman of charm
and culture and a low badge number, who does the editing.

Send contributions to BOOKIE::NEILSEN. I operate on the same lack of
principles as Mr. Parmenter, so what he says about his style applies to
my judgement or lack thereof as well.

Send requests for subscriptions to CASTOR::DESPERADO-REQUEST or
CASTOR::DESPERADO_REQUEST.
