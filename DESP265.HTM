I tried calling 1-800-969-4874   [1-800-WOW-IT'S-HOT] as instructed in
Desperado.  The system appeared to crash when I selected a sound to hear.
Another triumph of technology.

        I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton
        about 20 years ago. When somebody there predicted the market
        for microprocessors would eventually be in the millions,
        someone else said, "Where are they all going to go? It's not
        like you need a computer in every doorknob!"

        Years later, I went back to the same hotel. I noticed the room
        keys had been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots
        in the doors.

        There was a computer in every doorknob.

                                 quoted from an Internet message

In fact, you can go to Home Depot, HQ, etc. today and buy a replacement
doorknob  that has a microprocessor in it to replace your _home_ lock.  A small
LED  display on the front shows a single digit. Turning the knob to the right
or left  and holding it allows you to select the digits of the desired
combination.  When  all selected correctly the door unlocks.  After about 15-20
seconds it  automatically relocks itself.

I have often walked
Down that street before
though my keycard
never stuck in any door
But all at once am I
fifteen seconds shy
Now that I'm on the
street where you live.

=o= Fans and detractors of "News of the Weird" should check out
Cecil Adams' last book, _Return_of_the_Straight_Dope_, which
includes correspondence between Adams, "NotW" editor Chuck
Shepherd, and Jan Brunvand hisself, regarding the legendary
practice of "gerbil-stuffing."

=o= At issue was a "NotW" item which cited a medical journal as
listing "a live, shaved, declawed gerbil" among items removed
&gt;from various patients' hinterlands.  Investigation revealed that
no such thing was listed in any medical journal.

=o= Shepherd referred to it as a "transcribing error."

=o= That said, though, I do offer this item from "No Comment",
a similar feature that runs in _The_Progressive_.  I'm sure
that even Number Two Son, whose alma mater is located in the
East Coast's version of Santa Cruz, will enjoy it:

  The Santa Cruz Sentinel reports:  "Confessed armed robber Mark
  Joseph Johnson said he spent his take . . . [on] toilet paper
  and incense for his neighbors, paid his rent, saw some movies,
  ate nice dinners . . . He purposely spent the money locally,
  he said.  ``I shopped locally to make sure the money went back
  in.  Really, I thought that up,'' he said."

Think globally.  Shop locally.

Hmmm! Suggests that "mangry" should mean "of, about, or concerning a
manger," and "dangry"... well, I guess not. Too bad, though.

Subject: Re: #10 Not entirely idle (angry/hungry)

On your comments about ANGRY and HUNGRY:

This is indeed an old puzzle that has wasted a lot of time, but not
because there isn't one.  The time is wasted because the solution is as
old as the problem and no one goes and looks it up.

I include the answer from the rec.puzzles archive below, but first,
here's a quote from "Dickson's Word Treasury" by Paul Dickson:

   Each year some 2,500 letters come into Merriam-Webster asking questions
 about language.  These are all answered through its Language Research
 Service, a fancy name for the fact that the company encourages people who
 buy its dictionaries to ask questions about words and usage.

   One question, however, requires a form response because it is asked so
 often.  For reasons unclear, it is unrivaled as the most commonly asked
 question about English.

   The question always boils down to this: "I have been told that there are
 three words that end in -gry.  'Angry' and 'hungry' are easy to find, but
 what is the third?"

   The trick in the question is that the third is hardly a household word.
 Among the 460,000 entries in "Webster's Third New International Dictionary",
 the only other -gry word is "anhungry", an obsolete synonym for hungry,
 which owes its dictionary survival to the fact that Shakespeare used it.
 The "Third" also contains "aggry bead", a form of glass bead, but there is
 no evidence that "aggry" is ever used without the word "bead".

   Merriam-Webster editors found a few more in the massive 13-volume "Oxford
 English Dictionary", but they are so rare that some cannot be found in print
 outside the dictionary itself.  The OED contains "mawgry", "magry", and
 "maugry", which are all obsolete variant spellings of "maugre" (an archaic
 way of saying "in spite of"); "puggry", which is a variant spelling of the
 word "puggree" (a light scarf worn around a sun helmet); and "iggry", which
 is an English spelling of an Arabic word meaning "to hurry up".

================================================================
&gt;From the rec.puzzles archive:

==&gt; language/english/spelling/gry.p &lt;==
Find three completely different words ending in "gry."

==&gt; language/english/spelling/gry.s &lt;==
Aside from "angry" and "hungry" and words derived therefrom, there is
only one word ending with "-gry" in Webster's Third Unabridged: "aggry."
However, this word is defective in that it is part of a phrase "aggry beads."
The OED's usage examples all talk about "aggry beads."

Moving to older dictionaries, we find that "gry" itself is a word in Webster's
Second Unabridged (and the OED):

gry, n. [L. gry, a trifle; Gr. gry, a grunt]
   1. a measure equal to one-tenth of a line. [Obs.] (Obs. = obsolete)
   2. anything very small. [Rare.]
