At risk of seeming pedantic, I repeat my earlier query:  Does anyone know the
name of the
<h2 align=center><tt>New Zealander</tt></h2>
                                       who first achieved powered, sustained,
but NOT controlled heavier-than-air flight?  That word "controlled" seems to
be a minor stumbling block...

Emile Berliner was the gentleman who invented what he claimed to be the first
successful "talking machine", which I believe he called the "Gramophone".  His
machine used the now universal (for monophonic recording) "lateral" scribing;
Edison's machine used "hill-and-dale" cutting.  Berliner, I do believe, was
successful about a year before Edison, but because Edison was a merchandiser
par excellence Berliner is virtually forgotten.  The interesting point to
Edison's success is that when the Victrola Talking Machine Company hit the
market with its entry into the field, Edison's device began its decline into
oblivion.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I missed the word "controlled" in the first query, but I'd say that a
powered, sustained
<h2 align=center><tt>uncontrolled</tt></h2>
                                         flight is no day at the beach.
Control is what flying is all about.  Before they invented the
airplane, the Wright brothers invented the wind tunnel.  It may be
flatteringly mythical to think of them as tinkering bicycle mechanics,
but they were serious engineers who knew exactly what they were doing.

Correct on Berliner.  His record player used a disk, not a cylinder
like Edison's.  He engaged in a long patent fight with Edison.

I misspelled Atanassoff, by the way.

Some overdue comments on frosted raisin bread.

Frosting was not a total win.  When you took a slice of bread out of the
package, the frosting ALWAYS stuck to the wrapper so that you wound up with a
naked slice of raisin bread and a frosted piece of cellophane.  (What ever
happened to cellophane?)  After you scraped the frosting off the wrapper and
got it back on top of the bread, more problems showed up when you tosted the
bread. This was particularly unfortunate because toasting is raisin bread's
raison d'etre.

Worst was the old-fashioned type of electric toaster; the type with doors on
its sides that swing down. (I'm really dating myself with this one.) You had
to open the doors carefully and manually turn the bread on its vertical axis
before the door succeeded in flipping the bread on its horizontal axis.  If
that happened, you wound up with a sticky mess of melted frosting on the
bottom of the toaster. Popup toasters were a little better, the melted
frosting just gummed up the works.

Any handling of hot raisin bread toast was frought with peril. The molten
frosting was red hot and very sticky.  Kitchen napalm.  Your problems weren't
over even if you managed to get the bread successfully toasted and buttered.
It had to be eaten from the bottom up, so that the frosting had a chance to
cool before you got to it.  God help you if you bit into frosting before then.
I'm getting a funny feeling in my mouth just thinking about it- recherche du
temperature perdu.

As a kid, I loved it but as a putative adult, I'm afraid frosted raisin bread
goes on the More-Trouble-Than-It's-Worth list.  That list seems to get longer
and longer and longer ...

You're right, parts of speech and sentence diagrams are not the underlying
structure of language.  And they are something like phlogiston, although not
in exactly the way you imply.

Phlogiston was part of a hypothesis of how the world is put together.  It's
a laughably poor model as seen from our post-modern point of view, and before
Roger Bacon came along poor models were the rule.  But it was, after all,
a model, an abstraction from observation.  Models are made to be broken.

Today we have what we think are better models of fire.  Those models
were the result of breaking old models and putting them together in
new ways to better explain what we observe.  We no longer disembowel a
goat to appease the god of fire, and we no longer believe that the
word "breath" has the same magical denotation as it had in Sanskrit.
You are right: we break models for our amusement.

But people do not use words correctly any more than they use fire
correctly.  Most do, but every week or so you can read about some
catastrophic fire caused by human error.  People make mistakes,
believe foolish things, get caught looking in the wrong direction.
Remember the poor guy who dropped his wrench down into the Minuteman
silo?

The model-making process has its limits, as Cantor pointed out.  But
that does not mean that, because it is not a panacea, we should never
use it.

When Ike said "Oh?", did he mean "So what?"

Did he mean "Wow! What a revelation!"

Or "You jerk; why are you even talking about such twaddle?"

Or perhaps "Hunh?"

Or maybe "I don't agree with you on that."

He might even have meant "I guess I agree.  (Now hurry up and loan me the
money, will you?)"

There is no way of knowing.  I wonder what you think of Al Haig's
public speech.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I think Al Haig does not want to be understood in his public speech.

If I said "Man is a tool-using animal" would you complain that some
mechanic poked a hole in your radiator and that the statement was
therefore not true?  People use language correctly in the same broad
sense.  Some of them make mistakes.

The point of the "Oh?" response to the classic definition of a
sentence--as subject verb [object]--was that "Oh?" is a sentence with
none of those things in it.  Lotsa defaults?

By the way, even though I am indifferent to parts of speech, I never
use "loan" as a verb.

Subject: RE: language

Tom, I was interested to read your opinion on the underlying structure of
language in #1009. I take your point to mean that the language happens first
and the analysis necessarily happens later, that language is a living, changing
thing, not always consistent with itself in a strict logical manner.

Yes, I agree.  This is like the choice that linguists have: Is there a standard
English, or are regional variations equally valid in some way? Standardization
is a great convenience; it gives us a better chance at understanding each
other.  However, I can't see that some academic Solomon should say that one
dialect is better than another.  "Standard" also implies that language does not
change, which is not only wrong, but would make life much less interesting if
it were true. (Who wants to speak Esperanto, anyway?)

Your point of view isn't really that radical.  You admit that analysis can have
some usefulness, if only in a transient manner.  If you want to read radical
opinions, try Claude Debussy.  He said that analyzing music was like
"dissecting a flower", that the act of analysis necessarily destroyed what it
intended to describe.  That's radical.  It also helps explain why Debussy's
music is a bitch to analyze.

After a century of uselessness, Esperanto has finally come into its
own.  It was invented as a universal language, but in this universe
we all prefer our native languages.  At international meetings, this
preference for native languages led to chains of interpreters--going
from English to French to Flemish, or French to German to Russian to
Ukranian, for instance, because of a lack of English-to-Flemish or
French-to-Ukranian interpreters.  The new style is to translate the
English to Esperanto and the Esperanto to the desired native language,
with Esperanto serving the role of FLX.

RE:  Parmenter's radicalism anent the English language.  I am reminded of a
friend who is of the opinion that "If I say it, then it is a word."  Does that
thesis excuse such obvious misuses as "degregate/degregation" instead of "de-
grade/degradation"?  I am among the first to recognize that all languages
except COBOL are living, evolving structures; but I decry deliberate (or lazy)
misusage when a currently correct form exists.  Keep in mind that dictionaries
do NOT, as is popularly believed, prescribe the use of words; rather, they
chronicle it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
If I say the food in the cafeteria is "gup", it doesn't matter whether
you've heard the word before.  I have never heard "degregate", but we
are all witnesses to the possible transformation of "deprecate" into
"depreciate".  This is not always a pernicious process.  Just in the
last few years, football fans have turned "opportunistic" from a
pejorative applied to politicians and pirates into a neutral meaning
"capitalizing on opportunities". Some words just get lost along the
way; "contemn" means "to have or express contempt for" and it would be
a useful word, but it's gone, for now anyway.  If I used it, people
would think I meant "condemn". Too bad, I contemn and condemn the loss
of "contemn", but I can't bring it back.

If memory serves, the serenaders on Koko's little list were not
"banjo" in the original score--they were a word for black people
that we don't use any more.  (Notice how deftly I am avoiding the
use of the word "adjective" in deference to those who hate grammar.)

The 'Lovin Touch' DJ was Dick Summer.  He wrote 'poetry' which he used to
read on the radio and finally put some of it together into a booklet which
listeners could get by sending in $1.50.  I have a copy of it with a
copyright date of 1970.  I would be glad to send a Xerox copy of it to
Dahlberg or anyone else (unless the demand gets too high!).

Dick Somebody!?!!?  Anyone who was in Boston in the 60s should remember Dick
Summer, who did an all-night show on WBZ in the mid-60s (and who used to play
the one-hen, two-ducks thing then).  It was a great show, and all of us who
used to be up all night studying listened to it.  Summer went to NYC toward
the end of the decade, where, apparently, he was less than a smash.  After a
year or so, he was back with the Loving Touch, which was never as good as the
original Night Line show.
