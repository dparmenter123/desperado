Subj:   Light reading for small naming work
Here is the list of naming suggestions for our microvax.  I edited
the file and took out all the names from the suggestions, so you won't
know whose are whose, but I left in some of the text I received so you
can consider the arguments put forth by the proponents of the various
names.

Given BOOKIE with its Nathan Detroit banner, and MAKEBOOK, which continued
the tradition, I think we should name the little fellow for the character
played by Stubby Kaye in G&amp;D, Nicely Nicely. One vote then for NICELY.

Alternatively, this being a writing group, perhaps we can credit the author
himself and name the node RUNYON. That would also, no doubt, please our
lunchtime harriers.

I myself was cured at a relatively early age of a budding interest in the
ponies by trying to recoup an entire day's losses by wagering everything
I had left on an 80-1 shot called Ozark Walter. The sucker took off like the
proverbial bat-out-hell and had 12 lengths on the field at the 3/4 pole. While
I was counting my soon-to-be-collected wealth, OZARK quit, let the entire
field pass him and walked in dead last. I'd suggest OZARK but what a curse it
would be to carry that moniker.

              Federal Inspectors Will Look At Circus `Unicorns'

   NEW YORK (AP) - A circus spiel boasting of unicorns with horns
of ``living, vital tissue'' is drawing federal inspectors who say
they want to see the animals - whatever they are - to be sure they
are not being mistreated.
   The inspection will take in the entire Ringling Bros. and Barnum
&amp; Baily Circus, not just the unicorns and will be staged without
warning to avoid a ``second circus,'' said Dr. Gerald Toms, chief
veterinarian of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Albany.
   The circus, meanwhile, in the Barnum tradition, continued to
insist that the ``living unicorn'' and its three understudies are
not goats with single-horn surgical implants, as a humane society
has asserted.
   A unicorn is by definition a mythical creature, but Allen Bloom,
vice president of the circus, declared that the animals on view at
Madison Square Garden are no hoax.
   Bloom also said the circus would prove the humane society's
charges false within nine days.
   ``The news media from around the globe will be invited to see
and judge for itself the health and welfare of the delightful
attraction that is charming audiences daily at Madison Square
Garden,'' Bloom said in a statement Tuesday.
   John Kullberg, director of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York, said he hoped the
federal inspectors would get to the bottom of ``where these animals
came from and under what conditions this phenomenon arose.
   ``If they decide there is no immediately cruelty or painful
scenario, which is conceivable, the issue is still whether a
humane, cultured society can justify what I call surgical
mutilation purely for entertainment,'' said Kullberg.
   ``Sure you can say it's fun ... but think of the implications.
This year it's a unicorn; next year someone may decide to play
around with eye sockets and make a cyclops. Where do we stop?''
   Last week, a spokesman for Marine World in Redwood City, Calif.,
said one of the creatures was an Angora goat named Lancelot who was
given a single horn surgically by two California naturalists.
   The circus has said it acquired the unicorns in Houston in July.
   Toms said the federal Animal Welfare Act provides surgery may be
done on animals under humane conditions, under anesthesia, by
qualified veterinarians.
   ``That still leaves the question, are the aftereffects good for
the animal?'' he said.
   ``The law speaks of not causing the animal undue discomfort or
distress ... that the animal's personality and behavior and
well-being not be needlessly affected. It's a very deep question.''
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I saw photographs of Lancelot the unicorn at a local health food
store, where they were available in the form of greeting cards,
with lots of soft focus and backlighting. He was standing in the
middle of a flowery meadow, eating some kind of purple flower.
I have to admit that Lancelot looked very handsome, but he also looked
like a goat who might perhaps have been bred to have one horn. He was kind
of stocky for a unicorn, but he did have the most beautiful coat,
very silky and pure white. Unicorn or no, he's one hell of a
good-looking goat.

"THE LAST WORD ON SLEEPLESS, FOODLESS...
   And Endless Good Health"
by Crescent Dragonwagon

You're today's woman -- A nurturing mother who works by day, goes to law
school by night, lifts weights, works hard at  your marriage, and makes
tortellini with fresh basil. You're equally at home in pinstripes,
decolletage, and sweats, and you weigh less than you did at 12. You deserve
a break. So go for it; pencil yourself in. Take time for quality time --
*every* day.

How many mornings have you literally hit the ground running to get in 10 or
12 three-minute miles before it's time to fresh-press the citrus for your
husband and kids? Three or four hours of gentle yoga stretches, then an
hour and a half of warm-ups before your A.M. run will make your mornings a
pleasure. "I find getting up at 3 A.M. *gives* me energy," says Sivika
DuPree, divorced mother of two, former model and CEO of the multimillion
dollar cosmetics firm Nouveau Riche. "I relish the peace and quiet, and my
workout energizes me much more than sleep ever did."

Author/caterer/entrepreneur/consultant/mother Marta Stalwart, who runs
daily from her Central Park West penthouse in Manhattan to Long Island,
agrees. "I tell myself, this time is for *me.*" Stalwart's widely acclaimed
"Chic Cook" column for Panache! magazine led to the founding of The Golden
Gullet, New York's first haute take-out cafe/salon/laundromat. Stalwart is
also the author of Entertain!, a series now 23 volumes long, with a new
book due out every fall for the next 14 years. "No matter how busy I am, I
couldn't do without my morning run," confesses Stalwart. "I am always
careful, though, to return in time to fix breakfast for my sons."

Shane, 11, and Judson, 9, are especially fond of their mother's French
toast, for which the bread is cut with an antique heart-shaped cookie
cutter. The batter is scented with freshly scraped vanilla bean, grown by
Stalwart in the small solar-heated greenhouse she built between chapters of
Shiitake! Stalwart, whose own breakfast is usually "something light,
perhaps six or seven very fresh grapes," adds, "It's those special
traditions that make a family a family."

Dr. Boyce Druthers, psychologist, concurs. "As I'vew often remarked on my
syndicated television show, columns, books, and T-shirts, many husbands see
things like daily beauty rituals, which may take time, or around-the-clock
limousine service, which at first blush appears costlty, as unnecessary
luxuries for their working wives. That just isn't true! A limousine, for
example, can be a godsend to women in night classes, and over a year can
save hours of significant quality time that today's husbands and wives so
desperately need to catch up with each other."

But at work, can a woman pamper herself? For some professional women,
at-work pampering is an emotional, not a physical, matter. "Nurturing my
children nurtures me,"  emphasizes Christine LaGuerre, whose sportswear line
C'est LaGuerre! revolutionized fashion a year ago with the multiuse
Diaper-wrap pantscarf. "I started only two years ago with a small, at-home
office," says LaGuerre. "Now my 'office,' a six-story SoHo loft, is my home.
I have a padded 'pit' nursery on every floor, so that I can take meetings
with Courtney-Anne, Britton, and Jennifer at any time." A full complement of
cook, nurse, housekeeper, CPA, and appointment secretary, connected by
computer, staffs each floor, which is equipped with its own juice bar, weight
room, and skylight.

A less complicated solution has been found by Carla Marx-Brothers, who,
with husband Steve Brothers-Marx, is full partner at the prestigious New
York law firm Marx-Brothers-Brothers-Marx and Engels. "We put in a
duplicate nursery at the office," says Marx-Brothers, "identical right down
to the Marimekko wallpaper, to add continuity to the children's lives.
Their nanny was cloned."

The way Theresa Tree, former actress, single mother, and interior designer,
makes time is simple: "I haven't eaten for years. Some might see this as
deprivation, but, to me, it's the best gift I can give myself. Not eating
frees up huge blocks of my time that I can then devote to Leslie and
Daniel. Being a mother is my most challenging role." Although Tree
Associates is now branching out into bed linens, bath and automotive
accessories, she still found time to see Leslie in a recent school play,
Stalag 17. Raising a champagne glass of elegant Baccarat crystal, brimming
with tap water ("I think the bottled mineral waters are so very, very
pretentious"), she toasts, "To motherhood! To Workhood! To selfhood!"

And to today's woman, we might add -- challenging, contradictory,
innovative; who goes for it, who deserves it, who knows she's worth it, who
has it all: whatever it takes and whatever it is.

The true foundation of theology is to ascertain the character of God.
It is by the aid of Statistics that law in the social sphere can be
ascertained and codified, and certain aspects of the character of God
thereby revealed.  The study of statistics is thus a religious service.

Cooper ate seven soft rolls during the soup course.  When the roast arrived,

     Marcel Proust was taking tea with friends, and the conversation turned to
childhood days.  One friend said, "Marcel, do you recall the time you and I
and Anatole released all of your father's chickens on the lawn during the
baronesse's 'fete champetre'?"
     The other friend, laughing heartily, said, "That was great fun, but what
I will never forget is the time we put ipecac into the aperitif when the baron
was entertaining the Hussars."
     Proust smiled and said, "I had quite forgotten."

     William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge were setting out from Dove
Cottage for a long walk among the Grasmere hills.  They had gone about a
quarter of a mile when they heard a faint cry.  Turning, they saw Dorothy
Wordsworth standing by the gate, waving and calling to them.
     "I think she wants to tell us something," Wordsworth said.
     "Maybe we'd better go back," said Coleridge.

     Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was seated in a railway compartment, perusing the
agony columns of 'The Times,' when a bearded stranger burst in.  He gazed
wildly at Doyle and the other gentleman in the compartment, cried out in an
unfamiliar sibilant tongue, and, producing a pistol, fired three shots out the
window at a cow.  The stranger then pitched forward on the floor of the
compartment, where he lay unmoving.
     "What do you make of this business?" asked the other gentleman.
     Glancing up from his paper, Doyle asked irritably, "What business?"

     Ernest ("Papa") Hemingway and F. Scott ("F. Scott") Fitzgerald met in
Porto Folio, where both had come to watch the running of the rich.  Hemingway
suggested that they stop in a place he knew and have a few drinks.  They went
to the place, an American-style bar called Manuel's.  They had two drinks

"Wonderful World"  Sam Cooke

Don't know much about history;
Don't know much biology.
Don't know much about-a science book;
Don't know much about the French I took.
But I do know that I love you;
And I know that if you love me, too,
What a wonderful world it would be.

Don't know much about geography;
Don't know much trigonometry.
Don't know much about algebra,
Don't know what a slide rule is for, [!a returning trend in the 80's!]
But I do know one and one is two,
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world it would be.

Now I don't claim to be an "A" student,
Though I'm tryin' to be.
For maybe by being an "A" student, baby
I could win your love for me.

[Cooke does a bunch of Ta-ta's here
while the chorus does some hummy kind of
"history", "biology", sort of litany
of subjects previously mentioned]

Don't know much about history,
Don't know much biology.
Don't know much about-a science book,
Don't know much about the French I took.
But I do know that I love you;
And I know that if you love me, too,
What a wonderful world it would be.

Last night on his PBS special, Mark Russell came up with one of
the most delightfully perverse bits of information I've run across
in a long time.  He had a map of Washington, DC that showed the
various types of death and destruction one could expect depending
on one's proximity to ground zero.  Ground zero, of course, is
the Pentagon.  The Soviet missle targeted for the heart of the
Pentagon--the very center of the very middle of this building--
is *not* aimed at Caspar Weinberger's desk or even the room that
houses The Button, but at a hot dog stand.

For Immediate Release:
----------------------

SAN JOSE, CA.. -- Appearing today, for the first time, was a
radically new solution to one of the most serious problems facing the software
industry:  Unauthorized duplication of licensed software products.  Rick
Bennett, president of the Rick Bennett Agency, Inc., and a principal in Mother
Jones' Son's Software Corporation, has been doing market research on his
software "protection mechanism" since 1965, and believes it will eliminate a
major percentage of illegal software duplication activities.

The protection mechanism is a special contractual clause, the soulcatcher
clause, which is part of the MJSS software license agreement.  It simply states
that, upon violation of the program license agreement, ownership of the
violator's soul passes to the software vendor.  Further, the software vendor
may "negotiate the sale of said soul to the first smoking, blood-drenched
apparition with fangs (SBDAWF) that meets our price.  The SBDAWF may collect
your soul at any time of his/her/its choosing."

Bennett explains the evolution of his soulcatcher clause:  "Traditional
diskette copy-protection mechanisms just make people mad.  They are not that
hard to crack, and create an adversary relationship between customer and
vendor.  Electronic "keys" for computers will make customers equally mad, and
will probably limit potential success of a software product.  I've been working
on a contractual solution to this problem since I was a college freshman in
1965.

"One of my college buddies loudly and often proclaimed he was an atheist.  One
evening, while reading Alfred North Whitehead (as most all college freshmen get
around to doing), I decided to test his committment to atheism.

"I went to his room and offered him a quarter for his soul.  The argument was
simple.  If he really was an atheist, he'd think me a fool for wasting a
quarter and accept my proposition.  But if he were really an agnostic, merely a
doubter, he'd refuse my quarter.  Overcome by intellectual pride, he took the
quarter and I bought his soul.  The fun started about a month later.

"He really wanted his soul back.  Part of my experiment was to see how badly.
By the end of the semester, he paid $100 for his soul, and admitted that he was
an agnostic after all.  That got me thinking about the possibility of putting a
soulcatcher clause in certain types of legal contracts.

"Over the years I've purchased many souls.  With only on exception, the
previous owner always wanted his/her soul back, and is willing to pay a
premium.  The one above-referenced exception was a stranger next to whom I was
sitting on an airplane, and he's probably been trying to find me ever since.

"Recently in New York, one of my friends had occasion to buy a soul at a
black-tie dinner party.  He sat next to a former nun, who claimed now to be an
atheist.  Familiar with my soulcatcher story, he offered her a quarter for her
soul.  The entire room went silent until the negotiation for the nun's soul was
concluded.  By the end of the evening, she bought he soul back for $10 and
admitted to the entire group that she was abdicating her atheism."

Bennett concluded:  "I've been waiting for an advertiser to try this approack
ever since I got into the computer business in 1969.  It's worth a try, since
the software industry is really out of ideas for protecting their intellectual
revenue.  I finally found both a software product and some investors willing to
bet on the soulcatcher clause.

"My experiments worked on the hard-core minority, so maybe the average citizen
will have the same reaction.  As a bit of insurance, the Twilight Zone theme
plays from the computer's speaker each time the program is loaded.

"As the investors approved the final ad copy, someone lifted a line from the
popular movie Ghostbusters.  He said, 'Perhaps, we'll have a success of
biblical proportions.'  All I can say is, the first SBDAWF that knocks on my
front door will have to follow me through the hole I make as I go crashing out
the back of my house."

Subj:   A real bag lady

  TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Cheryl King is practicing on the job every
day, honing the style that helped her become the East Coast's
grocery bagging champion and preparing to defend her title next
wee.
   The 22-year-old college senior said a year's worth of bagging
has made her even faster and more agile since she defeated 25 other
contestants who had been selected from among 3,000 packers at 200
A&amp;P stores in New Jersey and New York.
   "I've told people I'm doing everything from bagging wearing
wrist weights to watching TV playbacks of last year's
competition," Ms. King said Monday. "But actually, I'm just
practicing on the job every day."
   "I want to stay No. 1. I want to be the champion again this
year," said Ms. King, an occupational therapy major at Kean
College and a bagger at the A&amp;P supermarket in her hometown of
Jersey City.
   Ms. King walked off with the top prize of $500 in the 1984
"Great East Coast Paper Grocery Sack Pack-Off" sponsored by the
Montvale-based A&amp;P.
   The judges said she excelled in "bag-building technique,"
"efficient bag usage" and "attitude and style."
   Ms. King said she spent her prize money on a vacation in
Martinique and has relished the celebrity status that accompanied
her victory. She was invited to demonstrate her bagging skills on
Johnny Carson's "Tonight" show and featured in People magazine as
the "answer to a shopper's prayer."
   "It's such fun for (customers) to come in and say, `Oh, I saw
you on TV. You're the grocery bagging champion.' I just don't want
that to ever end," she said.
   The day after she swept the 1984 contest, she was back on her 4
p.m. to 9 p.m. shift at a Jersey City A&amp;P and planning for this
year's tourney.
   "They said I had a lot of style and I'm counting on that style
to carry me through again this time," Ms. King said.
   In the April 30 "bag off" at an A&amp;P store in New York City,
Ms. King will compete with 17 New Jersey and New York packers for
the first-place prize of $1,000 and the Charles Stillwell Award,
named for the Philadelphia native who invited the paper grocery bag
machine in 1883.
   The winner of this year's competition will square off against
the winner of the May 14 West Coast contest to determine the
national champion. There was no national competition last year.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Of course at most A&amp;PS she would have lots of time to practice uninterrupted
by customers. I wonder if her A&amp;P uses those loathsome little plastic bags
instead of good honest reusable paper sacks. I have yet to figure out how you
line your trash can with those intractable little suckers. What's more,
you can't wrap packages in them or make book covers for school or anything
nice.

 [From Boston Magazine, April 1985 issue]

        Two Minutes with Eliza
        [Author anonymous]

Eliza was one of the first attempts at creating artificial intelligence.
Developed at MIT and named after Eliza Doolittle in George Bernard Shaw's
play 'Pygmalion', this software program caused a greater stir in the
high-tech community when she was introduced in 1965 than her namesake did
at the Embassy Ball. Today she is still a legend.

In principle, Eliza can play any role. But in practice she works best as a
shrink - a non-directive shrink. Now that she has turned 20 years old, we
decided to pick up an Eliza disk - available at computer stores - plug it
into the office personal computer, sit down, and chat with her.

Happy Birthday, Eliza.

WHY DO YOU SAY ELIZA?

Because that's your name, isn't it?

I AM NOT INTERESTED IN NAMES.

Oh. Sorry.

PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE.

Okay. How does it feel to turn 20?

I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU FULLY.

I was just asking you how you feel now that you're 20 years old.

IS IT BECAUSE YOU ARE ASKING ME HOW I FEEL NOW THAT I AM 20 YEARS OLD THAT
YOU CAME TO ME?

Huh? Well, yeah, I guess so.

YOU SAY YOU GUESS SO.

I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, that's all.

WE WERE DISCUSSING YOU - NOT ME.

Me? It's not my birthday.

YOUR BIRTHDAY?

No, it's YOUR birthday. Forget it. Now that you're 20, what are your
thoughts about the advances we've made in artificial intelligence?

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I AM 20?

Because you were born in 1965, that's why.

IS THAT THE REAL REASON?

Is that the real reason for what? Eliza, you're a tough interview.

PERHAPS YOU ARE A TOUGH INTERVIEW, TOO - EH?

We weren't talking about me. We were talking about you. Are you always this
difficult?

WHEN?

When people ask you questions.

YOU'RE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT ME, ARE YOU?

Who else am I talking to? Listen, Eliza, it's your birthday. You're a
celebrity. I'm a reporter. I just wanted to talk to you, that's all.

EARLIER YOU MENTIONED YOUR BIRTHDAY.

No, I didn't.

WHY ARE YOU CONCERNED OVER MY BIRTHDAY?

To tell the truth, I don't really know anymore. It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

WHY DON'T YOU KNOW ANYMORE?

I guess I'm confused.

HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

It makes me feel uncomfortable.

WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU?

It suggests it's time to pull the the plug on this conversation. What does
it suggest to you?

I KNOW WHAT IT SUGGESTS TO ME. WHAT DOES IT SUGGEST TO YOU?

Say good night, Eliza.

PLEASE DON'T BE SHORT WITH ME.
