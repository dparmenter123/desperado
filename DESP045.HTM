        From my military expert, Mr. Melvin Lippman of La Jolla: 50%
        of the entire military budget of the US now goes for salaries
        and another 15% goes for military pensions. "You can't mean
        it," I retorted, "almost two-thirds of our entire military
        budget goes for salaries and pensions and only one-third for
        hardware?" He shook his head, "That's right, but don't tell
        anyone."

When I was a reporter covering the Chicago City Hall in the glory days
of Mayor Daley, the typical portion of any department's budget
allocated to payroll and pension was about 90 per cent.  Obviously the
Department of Defense buys more hardware, but the proportion is still
surprisingly high, isn't it?

In Britain at the moment we have a water workers strike.

After telling us what would happen if our water were to be cut off because
of the strike, a recent piece of mail went on to say...

"Whilst our normal supply is maintained there is no advantage in taking
any measures other than the normal conservation of the utility, but
in the event of a failure, awareness and efforts to restrict the use
of water will extend our period of operation."

I think he means that we don't have to worry yet but if the water is cut
off we should not waste it.

SUBJ:   Hippos and Ponds

In the Topeka, Kansas, zoo there is a pond for the hippopotami.  The
pond is murky and disgusting in appearance.  Above the pond hangs a
sign, which says:

     "You'll find this hard to believe, but we drain this pond,
      scrub the sides and refill it with clean water every day.

     "Hippos, however, seem to abhor clean water.  Whenever a
      hippo enters a pond and finds it to be clean, it defecates
      in the pond.  Even if the hippo recently left the pond,
      it always seems to be able to defecate again if it finds
      the water too clean.  As long as the hippo remains in the
      pond it continues to defecate.  So the pond grows murkier
      and murkier.

     "So, you see, we try to keep the pond clean, but the hippos
      don't seem to like it that way, and they keep winning out."

My brother, John, who works for a large Midwestern manufacturer as a
Director of Finance noticed this sign.  He observed that it seemed to
have some striking applicability to his work environment.

It occurred to him that some individuals and groups tend to be Hippos,
and other individuals and groups tend to be Ponds.

John's had some success in using this observation to help his group spend
more time being Hippos and less time being Ponds.

He is now investigating what corollary insights can be derived
from observing the size of the Hippos, the number of Hippos, and the
lengths of time they spend in and out of the Pond.

I wonder if he's found the only organization to which the Hippo/Pond
phenomenon applies ...

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, most DEC sites have ponds.

By the way, "hippopotamus" is another of those Greek words with Latin
endings and should be pluralized "hippopotamuses" except by Ancient
Greeks and Latins. "Cactus", too.

Subject: All you ever wanted to know about cricket...

Jeff Goodenough's interpretation of the rules of American Football has prompted
me to set the record straight as far as the rules of cricket go before someone
in the US responds. So, just so that no one in the US has any excuse for not
understanding the game, here is how it goes:

In the game of cricket there are two sides, each consisting of eleven players.
One side is termed as being in but the other side is not termed as being out
because only members of the team that is in can be out.

The game starts by the team that is not in going out followed by two members of
the team that is in going out. The aim of the team that has just gone out is to
get one of the members of the team that is in who have just gone out out. This
is done by throwing a round leather thing at pieces of wood. The players from
the team that is in have to stop the leather thing hitting the pieces of wood
by hitting the leather thing with another piece of wood otherwise they will be
out. If they hit the leather thing out then they get six runs. If they hit it
out but it touches the ground first, they get four runs. However if the
leather thing stays in they can also score runs individually.

There are many ways in which the player from the team who is in can be out.
Briefly, these are being caught out, bowled out and run out. When one of the
players who is in is out then he leaves the field and is replaced by the next
member of the team that is in who then goes out. Once more, the objective of
the team that is not in is to get one of these players from the team who is in
out. When the team that is not in gets all the players from the team who is in
out then the side that was in is not in but out, so momentatrily both teams are
not in. There is one exception. The last player in the team who is in can never
be out because there always has to be two players from the side that is in out.
This will eventually lead to the two players who are out being the last two of
the team that is in. When the side that is not in gets either of these two
players from the team that is in out then there will be no more players from
the team that is in to come out because once all the players from the team that
is in have been out and the team that is not in has got them out they are not
allowed in again. Therefore the last player remaining out from the team that is
in is termed as being not out. Other players from the team that is in may also
not be out at the end of the game because they have chosen to declare. This
means they have retired and are not therefore termed as being out but at the
same time they cannot be in again.

So, when the side that is in is all out, the side that is not in now becomes
the side that is in and the side that was in now becomes the side that is not
in and so the whole process is repeated. When both sides have had two innings
(that is they have been in and out twice) then the side that has scored most
runs is termed the winner.

NB: A player in a team who is not in cannot be out. Only players whose teams
are in can be out.

Hope that's clear! (apologies to a poster I saw somewhere once).

do with the file cards and she LOVES it.  (Part of the reason she bought
the additional memory was to make it run faster...and it still takes,
maybe 2 seconds, to find an individual entry and take her into editing mode,

If I'd known that computer poetry was going to provoke such a response
--- as overwhelming as announcing a testimonial dinner for James Watt
--- I wouldn't have spent all those languid, torturous hours perusing
shelves of non-books for examples of the stuff.

The examples are pretty silly. But the idea of using a computer to
write, or help write, poetry isn't so silly. (Robert Bridges wouldn't
have understood; but Catullus would have.) After all, James Merrill,
or somebody, writes `poetry' using a ouija board. I don't know if it's
any good, but it gets him reviewed by Helen Vendler in THE NEW YORKER
and maybe it'll get him a MacArthur grant, f'crissakes.

Suppose you run some mammoth program to check for rhymes or syllabic
patterns or whatever. No worse than using a rhyming dictionary. No
worse than using a thesaurus. (So long as you don't use a dictionary
to solve the Sunday TIMES crossword ...) Probably there aren't many
programs out there that are really useful to a poet, but sometime
there may be. Auden, you know, was going to be a mining engineer
(which is one reason why his poems are a little obdurate). So maybe
there's a high school kid, learning BASIC on RSTS/E, who will someday
compose an elegy with the help of a program that locates beautiful, if
obscure, words. No one gets upset when sculptors use blowtorches to
work metal --- well, unless they sculpt something that looks like an
AFTER example for a Ralph Nader Corvair.

Maybe the reason we're leery about having computers generate poetry or
prose is that we suspect that intelligence would be replaced,
originality would be obviated. We'd be fooled somehow. "Aha! You
dimwit, you thought it was Racine! It  was Pascal! And I don't mean
Blaise Pascal, either, you jerk!" Ain't gonna happen. You can improve
technique, but not what is logically prior to technique: sensibility.
Or, inspiration, or intelligence, or whatever.

Now the question is, if great poets or novelists had been programmers,
what languages would they have worked in? Henry James would definitely
have been a COBOL programmer. Shakespeare --- I don't know. IBM 360
Assembly language, I guess. Hemingway? He'd put the whole thing in a
macro. Donne and Herbert and Marvell --- Pascal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
This doesn't really have anything to do with Marvell, except as a pun,
but it has a lot to do with poetry and art and all.

        The Marvellous is always beautiful.
        Everything Marvellous is beautiful.
        Nothing but the Marvellous is beautiful.

        found this idea while rummaging thru diskland here in MR..

Subject: Dark Emitting Diode Project Proposal.

        After ruling out several other technological innovations and
development projects (e.g. DBMMS data base mismanagment and non-operating
systems -- already done by the VAX project, elimination of machine dependent
irrelevencies etc.), it has come to my attention that the yield in the light
emitting diode (LED) production facility has been down significantly
(in the order of 50%).

        Noting this, we propose that we enter the manufacture and distribution
of dark emitting diodes (DED). This would provide a number of significant
improvements in the manufacturing line by the fact we will now get 100% yield.

        The dark emitting diodes (DED) would be useful for a number of
        commercial and consumer products. For example:

        A flashlight for the day time.

        In computer applications:

        Optical photosense card/paper tape read that could sense non-holes.

        An erasable PROM protective feature, whereby you would place one
        of these over the PROM so that no stray light could happen to erase it
        while in use.

        Computer readout capability for situations where the is a very high
        ambient light problem. the DED would always be able to indicate a zero
        state that could be seen even by the most remote observer. (Note that
        DED's always indicate zero conditions, never ones.)

        In military applications:

        This could include anti infra-red devices that would
        cause black fields in the area being investigated.

        Create an effective "cloaking" device to hide yourself from unfriendly
        sorts by aiming the DED's at yourself.

        In laser applications DED's could be used for focusing laser beams by
        surrounding the laser beam with them to decrease refraction.

        Photographic applications:

        Darkroom applications for problems in film development in the outdoors.

        A dark flash for taking photographs where the film would be in danger
        of overexposure.

        Consumer market:

        Light dimmer switches for use outdoors in the daytime.

        Sun glasses.

        Lamp shades.

        Anti dazzle headlamps for night driving when the oncoming car
        refuses to lower his lights.

As you can see we have carefully researched the possibilities for this
device and with proper funding we can have power to rule the world,
gain respect, date real women, and make big money in the high paying
computer maintenance business.

Subj:   New Jokes mailing lists

    It has come to my attention that several folks in the various DECset/HQOO
or whatever groups get good jokes and funny articles from many and varied
sources.  I also know that, to date, there has been no method of spreading the
humor around to interested parties consistently (I notice this especially when
I get 14 copies of the same joke from people in the group).

To remedy the situation I would like to propose the creation of two mailing
lists for humor, which we all could use to circulate any good jokes we
receive:

        PICA::GOODHUMOR for tasteful humor (like Dave barry articles)
and
        PICA::BADHUMOR  for jokes of questionable taste and social value

If you are interested in being on either of these lists send me some mail
indicating which.  The default will be GOODHUMOR only.  I will be willing to
maintain the lists, but will not in any way be responsible for what gets
circulated via the lists.
