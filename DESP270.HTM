I adored the new movie version of "Little Women".  Like many men, I'd
never read the book or seen the earlier movies, which is a shame,
because it's such a great story.  So, in the interest of getting more
men and boys into the theatre, I've created:

               !!!!LITTLE WOMEN ACTION FIGURES!!!!

There's big trouble in little Concord, but the March Sisters are
READY for ANYTHING!  Look, MARTIAL ARTS MARMEE is taking out the
abusive schoolmaster: "So you like to beat little girls, pig?  My
nunchuckus are going to beat YOU to a PULP!!"

MEGATON MEG is going to the coming-out party in style: "Afternoon
dress?  EXCUSE ME FOR LIVING, WITCH!  Maybe it'll look better to you
after I shove this neutron bomb up your bustle!!"

BIONIC BETH takes everything life dishes out, and keeps coming back
for more: "I was never like the rest of you.  Now you'll never be like
me -- with my bionic implants, I'll live forever!!  Hey, God, you want
me up there with you?  You're going to have to do better than scarlet
fever!!"

Sometimes, a girl's WORST ENEMY can be her own SISTER. Here's
JOLTIN' JO: "You torched my manuscript, Amy -- now my LASER BLASTER is
going to torch YOU!"

But when sisters fight, look for tough old AUNT FORCED MARCH to make
peace: "In my day, we used our bare knuckles to settle our disputes,
and that's how you girls'll do it, too.  Duke it out right here and
now -- and the loser has to fight ME!"

Remember -- when the going gets tough, the March Sisters get busy!!
March Sisters starter set comes with two action figures, weapons, and
collector cards.  Marchmobile, Aunt Forced March, and Boy Toy Teddy
sold separately.

 Which reminds me to alert you that there is actually a small particle
 of brain lodged somewhere in the skull of "The Brady Bunch Movie".
 The Bradys remain stuck back in the 70s, but the rest of the world
 has moved on.  The Bradys are the only ones with an Astroturf lawn.
 They all wear their colorful polyester 70s clothes and fail to see
 the grunge around them.  All very amusing and sappy, and I never
 even watched the show.  Take the kids, the sly lesbian scene will
 slip right past them.

Song     : (To the tune of Pinball Wizard)

   Unix Wizard

Ever since I heard of Unix
I've always had a ball,
&gt;From Berkeley up to Linux
I must've run 'em all;
But I ain't seen nothing like him
On systems large or small
That tired, squinting, blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

He sits just like a statue,
Like part of the machine,
Feeling all the limits,
Knows what signals mean,
Hacks by intuition,
His process never stalls,
That tired, squinting, blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

He's a Unix Wizard,
I just can't get the gist
A Unix wizard's
Got such a mental twist.

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions,
Don't hear no biffs or bells,
Don't see no lights a flashin'
Ignores his sense of smell,
Patches running kernels
Dumps no core at all,
That tired, squinting, blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

I thought I was
The process table king,
But I've just handed
My root password to him.

Even on my own hot boxes,
His hacks can beat my best.
The network leads him in,
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy Finger servers
Never will seg-fault...
That tired, squinting, blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

         BONZO LEADER, BRITISH ZANY, VIVIAN STANSHALL DIES IN FIRE

According to yesterday's (Tues 7th) Guardian (and reproduced entirely
without permission):

Bonzo Dog leader, a true English eccentric, dies in bedroom blaze
=================================================================
(Written by John Mullin)

Vivian Stanshall,leader of the cult sixties pop and comedy group the
Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, has died in a fire at his London home. He was
52.

Stanshall, a thorough British eccentric, was found in the bedroom of
his flat in Muswell Hill on Sunday. Investigations are under way to
establish the cause of the fire. There will be an inquest.

He had recently signed a new recording contract with WEA. The aim was
to produce a follow-up recording of one of his more famous
characters, Sir Henry at Rawlinson End.

[end of extract]

In today's Guardian there is an obituary which says that Warners may
release the material which he has recorded since the contract was
signed in 1993. There is also an appreciation of Viv by Neil Innes.

"I don't give a toss what you have done with me when I've shuffled
off me mortal coil. Shove a bit of flex up my back passage, stick a
light bulb in my mouth and stand me in the hall." - Sir Henry.

Vivial Stanshall - March 21, 1943 - March 5, 1995. Sadly missed.
Cheers

 I loved that band, funny, smart, eclectic, often rocking.  I had breakfast
 with them once, but it was just a pleasant time, not a hint of zaniness.
 They had just finished a gig at the Boston Tea Party with the Grateful
 Dead.  Among his many distinctions, Vivian Stanshall was "the doodah man"
 of the Grateful Dead song "Truckin'".

The following sentence just "appeared" in a response I wrote on another
mailing list:

        What's going is is that that is not a broadcast.

I was going to edit it, as it sounded rather bad, but couldn't resist leaving
it that way as an example of a sentence "appearing in nature" - i.e., one
produced without special effort by a native speaker of the language - with two
successive repeated words.

Can anyone produce more repetitions (likely *not* in a "natural" sentence, of
course)?

&gt;Just another piece of junk in the bike lane of a well

&gt;
&gt;What does surprise me though is how many cyclists must
&gt;have gone by this in the last few days without bothering
&gt;to take a few seconds out of their busy schedule to get it
&gt;out of harm's way. I don't think that it is an exageration
&gt;to say that this thing could have seriously injured or
&gt;even killed someone who hit it. Still no one thought to do
&gt;anything about it. I think that is pretty disgusting.

I am reminded of a wonderful, strange old man I had the good fortune to know
in the '70's and '80's, Cutler DeLong West.  A retired crystallographer, he
devoted his later years to the cause of promoting utility cycling.  He was a
familiar sight around Cambridge, Mass., looking like a turban-less ayatollah
Khomeni, riding one of the fleet of beat-up ladies' three-speeds he
maintained.  To most people, he looked like a wino; he wasn't. I believe he
was one of the original partners of Polaroid, and was well fixed.  He had in
fact established a foundation, which I believe still exists, to promote
utility cycling.  He was cranky, half-deaf, and could be difficult, but he
was an environmental saint.

When I was at the Bicycle Repair Collective, he would come in every couple of
weeks to give us a box of recycled ballpoint pens that he had salvaged from
the roadside and repaired by various means.  When he lit one of his generic
cigarettes, he would split the match in two, so he got 40 lights from a book
of matches.  He did not beleive in wasting resrources.

The reason Eric's posting reminded me of Cutler was that one piece of
equipment that he was never without was the brush half of a broken windshield
snow-scraper/brush, salvaged from the roadside.  When he would come upon a
patch of broken glass in the road (in those pre-bottle bill times, a common
occurence) he would stop, and sweep the glass shards out of the way.  His
efforts probably prevented thousands of flat tires for cyclists who never
gave him a second look on his unfashionable clunker.

I miss him.

Subject: Those &lt;bleeping&gt; words...

The "dirty words" list (and the eternal question, "What
_is_ dirty, anyway?") came to mind as I was watching "Blazing
Saddles" tonight. Until now, every single time I've seen this
movie on television, it's been censored so badly as to render
half the conversations nonsensical, and remove a large
percentage of the humor - prime examples being the complete
suppression of the soundtrack for the beans-around-the-
campfire scene, suppression of the n-word (and anything else
remotely resembling an epithet), deletion of about half of
Lily von S's song, and even the smothering of her last name
into something like "St...p".

Well, in this night's broadcast, I was delighted (and amused)
to find that almost everything was intact. Oh, there were
still some unfortunate edits to trim the running time - of the
Mongo/Bart battle, only the candygram sequence remained - but,
dialog-wise, this was the most intact TV presentation I've
seen. [I suspect the folks at 56 of having a keen sense of
sarcasm. They did edit out one word with great consistency:
"S2t." And they left that in when it was sung instead of
spoken! Could they have been making a statement of sorts???]

The best of Cecil Adams is only available in book form; however, the weekly
columns are posted (by "little Ed", the power behind the throne) to the
newsgroup alt.fan.cecil-adams and are collected at a web site I ran

Incidentally, the third book has been released; my copy is still on order.

As for UNIX, the end of time in a 32-bit universe is (if I've done

&gt;from my friend paul, ceci's husband:

 And I must say as much as I enjoy all this computer, network, and disk
 stuff, it just doesn't hold a candle to sitting down and reading a
 book, allowing myself to settle into someone else's monologue and
 really listen for an extended period of time. Interactive is all fine
 and dandy, but nuance of argument often depends upon "having the stage"
 for an extended period of time. If someone is free to jump to another
 part of the "creation" at any time, the writer has lost control and can
 no longer conjure up subtle images and/or ideas. I'm sure there's a
 place for hypertext, but I'm just as sure there's a place for books.

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 Linear storytelling has worked for 400,000 years.  No reason to
 think it has stopped working.  A lot of the "computer, network, and
 disk stuff" (including MTV stuff and Macintosh art director stuff)
 doesn't work, even in its own context.  Actually, I'm writing a book
 myself, but it isn't linear.
