I have been waiting impatiently for the end of summer to be in sight so that
I can tell you all about the Nashua Choral Society! I'm hoping there are some
good voices out there itching for a chance to sing with us.

The Choral Society meets once a week, Monday nights from 8-10, at Alvirne High
in Hudson, NH, and has about 120 singers in it. Our director is James Johnston,
an outstanding choral director with marvellous taste in music. What's
important about him is that he communicates his musicianship particularly well,
so that you become a better singer by singing with him.

We're going to be doing several programs next year. The fall concert will
be the Verdi Requiem with soloists from the Metropolitan. I only know the
soprano, Gilda Cruz-Romo, a Spanish lyric soprano. The Christmas program
will probably be a staged version of Amahl and the Night Visitors.
Our spring program will be the Handel oratorio, Israel in Egypt.
There's also a smaller chorus, the Chamber Chorus, with about 24 singers in
it.

The chorus goes on European tours every two years or so -- we're just back
from Belgium, France, England and Wales, as you know.

You should be able to read music moderately well, although I've found that
my sightreading has improved out of sight since I joined three years ago.
We are always short of tenors, but all parts are very welcome.

Rehearsals will start the week after Labor Day. You will come to the first
three rehearsals and then have an audition. He'll test you on how well you've
picked up the music, as well as checking your range, sight-reading, and testing
your ear on picking up tones played to you and singing them back to him.

Be sure and let me know if you have any questions. I can tell you that it's a
great group to be with, lots of work, but much joy! Get in touch with me
at 381-2661.
