I guess the tone in Gordon's memo about his trip to Apple was more
significant than we thought.  I had the distinct impression that he
was, to say the least, dissatisfied with how we do things.

        The plot seems to be thickening. If you didn't hear, Dave
Rodgers, the Distributed Systems Hardware Engineering group manager
submitted his resignation around July 5th or 6th (announced on the
6th, I think) to take the position of vice-president of Engineering
for Sequel Computer Systems of Portland, Oregon. Sequel is a start-up
comprised of 11 former Intel employees. Its marketing veep is Larry
Wade, former VAX OEM marketing manager.

        Two days after Dave Rodgers announced his resignation, Dave's
boss, Bernie LaCroute, Distributed Systems manager, also announced
that he was leavingfor Sun Microsystems. I think that Sun is Sunoco' s
answer to Exxon Office Systems, but I'm not sure - haven't seen any
ads yet.

        Dave was essentially in charge of all of the Ethernet and
traditional comm gear development programs. Bernie owned all of that
plus DECnet software.

        Sounds like BJ is going to be busy...

Not only at the top:

        Lynn Davis

        Simon Bate

        Keith Dawson

Do others see key people on the move? Is it a sign of trouble for DEC or just
a symptom that the economy has improved?

well, this is the first time in the 6 "gordon leaving" rumors since
i've been here that it made the globe.  maybe this time it's true.

Subject: Keith Dawson, of DSR and TMS fame is leaving DEC today. Could you
send the following annoucement to the Desperadi? Thanks, Alice Phalen

Keith Dawson is leaving Digital after 7 years for the pleasures and perils of
a Cambridge start-up firm. Join us to help see him off:

                Wednesday July 20, from 3:00 pm on
                Bob White's Princeton Lounge
                Rte. 4, Chelmsford, MA

Directions:

 - Take Rte. 3, north or south as appropriate.
 - Get off at Massachusetts Exit 32 (Rtes. 3A and 4, Drum Hill Circle).
   This is the second exit north of Rte. 495, or the fourth exit south
   of the NH border.
 - Go around the rotary as many times as you need to for Rte. 4 North.
   (Coming from the south, it's the second exit off the rotary, less than
   180 degrees around. From the north, go almost 360 degrees around.)
 - In 1/4 mile, bear left (straight as possible) at a flashing yellow light.
 - Bob White's is a sprawling place on your left soon after, just after a
   plant nursery.
