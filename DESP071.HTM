My immediate reaction to #1050 with its network menu merry-go-round
was "HOCKEY has its own *&amp;*&amp;4^%&amp;$*#(!!! group?" And nude sunbathing,
and suicide, and all kinds of other things that exist to make its
adherents feel good -- but no NET.OPERA? This confirms a growing
feeling of mine, which is that there is nothing like loving opera to
make you feel like you have two heads. (Unless it's loving choral
music, which is even stranger. I know people who like to sing it, but
I know hardly anybody who likes to TALK about it.) See, the whole
point of loving opera is that it is extravagant, irrational, and it
satisfies a deep and deplorable human need: GOSSIP. Never mind talking
about Princess Di and Ronnie and Nancy and the grandmother of all
gossip, Jackie. We are not talking tacky here, we are talking SCANDAL
and RUIN and MONEY and oh yes, art truth and beauty. What I want is to
listen to La Gioconda and then talk to somebody about all the latest
stories about Caballe's cancellations, and whether Domingo is going to
do a new wave album, and did you notice that Pavarotti skipped all the
fioriture in the broadcast of Idomeneo, and have you HEARD what Ken
Russell did to Madama Butterfly at Spoleto! (Hear about it! My dear, I
was THERE!) And nobody is out there with the same cravings...nobody is
out there except OPERA NEWS to tell me about what Flicka von Stade
eats for breakfast...or what kinds of scandals Jimmy Levine has gotten
himself involved in this week (or who he's sleeping with...speculation
ranges from Leonard Bernstein  to the Cleveland string section to
E.T.). A great part of loving anything is talking about it, and don't
tell me to visit NET.MUSIC -- opera is a lot more than music, and
someone capable of lumping them together is not capable of generating
the kind of specific endless connoisseur CHITCHAT I miss. Is there
anybody else out there who thinks Ruth Welting is the voice of the
decade? Who loves to hear all the new contralto Rosinas? Who stays
home Saturday afternoons for more than the Songs of the Cat? Who wants
to hear what Ken Russell did to Madama Butterfly?

Ken Russel is famous for his ridiculous homoerotic fantasy movies
about 19th century musical figures.  Roger Daltry as Franz Liszt
should tell you all you need to know.  He also did the truly horrible
movie of "Tommy", which is where Ken came across Roger.  I believe Ken
did a punk-rock version of Madame Butterfly.  Not that these things
*never* work out.  Jerry Lee Lewis was reportedly frighteningly
brilliant in the rock'n'roll version of "Othello"  (the tragedy, not
the game).

Just a quick note to tell you about a fledgling magazine titled as above. Its
purpose, according to its founder (Peter Landsdowne) is "to provide publicity,
promotion, and production services to the jazz community." Landsdowne is its
publisher and editor (and entire staff, at this point). He hopes to "bring
together the network of jazz practitioners, fans, and followers that exists
throughout the six New England states" by publishing a quarterly journal.

It's nice to see that someone's interested in the local scene, and is
willing to keep everyone informed about what's happening on the New England
scene. Just thought you'd like to know. If you want more info, drop me a line.

Subject: DEC, training ground for the competition

I just spoke with another member of the massive exodus to other
companies.  I'm meeting more of these every day.

He told me, "There's nothing left to be done at DEC, at least as
far as compilers are concerned.  Our compilers already have more
features than most of the users will ever need.  So now I'm going
to a company where the compilers are for *%#!, where I can write
a couple of new compilers from scratch."

How can we keep digitalsoftwa-reengineering interesting to bright
young folks like him?  In the old days we used to completely rewrite
operating systems from scratch between releases.

Shouldn't we try to keep these people rather than let them wander
off and make other vendors' software as good as ours?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Some might say that writing V1.0 of a compiler is sexy, but that
settling down to engineer the compiler to work with operating systems
is hard, and not that attractive to the young compilist.

        Ohm's law is one of my most favorite laws. It basically goes something
like this. It states, of course, that current through a device is proportional
to the voltage across it. Unfortunately, there are lots of exceptions, even
among very ordinary devices--like a tungsten wire or wire spun on a bobbin.
The discrepancy from Ohm's law becomes even more significant for  solid state
devices like diodes.

        However the elegance of the inherent proportionality of voltage to
current is so appealing that we don't want to tamper with the basic law itself.
Instead, the discrepancy is resolved in a different way--by introducing the
property of resistance. We say that the current is indeed proportional to the
voltage for a constant resistance, however some devices have the curious
property of variable resistance. In effect, it is not that current and voltage
are not proportional, it's that the constant of proportionality changes--
sometimes, in fact, the "constant" is a function of current or voltage. The
devices are then said to be "non-ohmic". Naturally Ohm's law could not be
expected to hold for non-ohmic devices!

I am a developer on the DECOR product.  DECOR is a implementation of
the ACM/SIGGRAPH Core Graphics Proposed Standard.  We recently released
version 1.0 and are now working on V1.1.  We would like to run some
comparisons of DECOR with other competitive Core-based packages, such
as DI3000.  Comparison with packages based on the ISO GKS Graphics
Standard might also be run.

Does anyone know of any groups in the company which currently have
licenses for packages such as these?  Please send any information
to me at DVINCI::BARRY or the Project Leader, Burns Fisher, at
DVINCI::FISHER.

I am sure that in the next few hours and days we will get braver than

the EBOX and MBOX interacted with it correctly.

Reported recently in the Technology column of the Wall Street Journal was
a new program called InvisiCalc. The program does nothing.

"CE Software of Des Moines, Iowa, mailed about 250 copies to trade publications
and others as an April Fool's attention-getter. Now there's so much interest in
the item that CE Software is preparing to market InvisiCalc.

Richard Kirsner, president of the company, even thinks it may be profitable.
He regards InvisiCalc as the 'equivalent of the Pet Rock' for the computer
industry."

My favorite, from a technical camera manual:

    The construction is designed, all things considered, to prevent fingers
    and others from going inside, which seems apparently simple.

Also in Japan, t-shirts and shopping bags with English phrases are very
popular, and almost none of them make any sense.  I saw guys wearing
t-shirts that said "I'm a cool dud", and girls (who didn't know better)
wearing ones that said "Honey House".  Shopping bags covered a lot of
turf, but they were often very silly, e.g., "Hi, I'm Pep Cat....I have
a many girl friends!"  One of the best:  "Please fuck the Zeb Star girls!"
Stationery, too, got little phrases on it, like:  Many things un-understandable
a chicken-hearted seems slim usually.  The best of all was the "Puberty"
stationery....a plan pad, and at the top it just said "Puberty".  They go
on and on.  Howard

A great many of the old Desperados are stored at KERMIT::DB2:[303,5]
in files with names like DESPJUL83.MAI and DESPSEP81.MAI and so forth.
I don't mind if you browse in them, with discretion.  If you have

From: PHILPOTT

For other nodes to get at files on KERMIT, they will have to have some
account/password to get in.  The mechanism that is used is for the
remote user to use the account DECNET with the password KERMIT.  This
account cannot be logged in to from a terminal, so there is no need to
worry about that.  For our group's network, we have "global aliases"
defined so people don't have to explicitly include the access control
string when going from, say, CASTOR to KERMIT.  On the VMS systems, we
have system-wide logical names defined that have the access control.

For an RSX user to get at your files, the must use:

        NFT TI:=KERMIT/DECNET/KERMIT::dduuu:[ggg,mmm]filename.ext

For a VMS user they need to use:

        TYPE KERMIT"DECNET KERMIT"::dduuu:[ggg,mmm]filename.ext
