Now that VMS Mail allows folks to subtitle themselves, I'm pleased to
see so many neat personal-name messages in mail.

My favorite is from someone (I don't remember his name):

                " From the terminal of &lt;his_name&gt; "

Mine usually reads

                "This space for rent",

and along the same lines, someone else came up with

                "Your ad here"

Seasonal personal names are interesting:

        Mike Bibeault's now reads,

                "Roast beast is a feast I can't stand in the least"

Also enjoyed "Miller Time", "Crazy Eddie", and many "Mad Hacker"'s.

"From the terminal of" is from the terminal of Desperado Tony Lekas.

        When contributing to any of the USENET newsgroups, please
        be sure to give them a return mail address somewhere in
        the message ( especially if you are asking for responses
        via mail ). The USENET community is not really aware of
        the gateway and how to use it, so you have to tell them
        how to get mail to you.

        The USENET mail is similar to old Phase II DECnet, in that
        you have to specify the entire path the mail message will
        take. An adopted practice in the USENET newsgroups is to
        give a return address from a "well known" node ( or several ).
        Most people would know what the path was to the well known node,
        and thus would be able to send mail to you. Below are some example
        return addresses for ROLL::FEATHERSTON ( UUCP is the protocol used
        on the USENET, ARPA is the return address if someone wishes to send
        you mail from the ARPANET.

        Examples:

        UUCP:           ... decvax!decwrl!rhea!roll!featherston
                        ...allegra!decwrl!rhea!roll!featherston
                        ... ucbvax!decwrl!rhea!roll!featherston

        ARPA:           decwrl!rhea!roll!featherston@Berkeley
                        decwrl!rhea!roll!featherston@SU-Shasta

        It is very important to get "rhea" in the string. We have a lot
        of duplicate names between the USENET and the ENET. If they don't
        send it through decwrl&lt;-&gt;rhea, it could end up on a totally
        foreign system.

This is a blurb in the "BREAKPOINTS" section of "MINI-MICRO SYSTEMS" magazine
for November 1983, page 19, which Desperadi may be interested in:

        "A new DEC Rainbow users group reportedly has quietly started at,
        of all places, IBM Corp.'s PC headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla.
        One reason the IBM employees may prefer the Rainbow over the PC is
        the Rainbow's superior graphics capabilities."

Subject: Folks - here's a late news bulletin on Andy's tape.

  The mystery has been solved - no one has taken out a contract
on Andy; he may continue to live on.  The problem is STAR's TE16;
Andy's tape has two BOT markers spaced at a wide enough distance
between them.  The TE16 loading the tape does not see the first
BOT and continues on eventually locating the second BOT.  On the
tape, Andy has both his previous DOS items and what he recently
put there.  If the TE16 had only found the first BOT, then there
would have been no mystery.

  Oh well - I don't know if any museum will appreciate a tape
with two BOT markers.  Why were the two BOT markers there in
the first place???

Subj: "mangled" advertising.

The Stockholm office made up some bumper stickers showing a Pro-style
keyboard and screen and the text (translated) "Buy from someone who
will be around in a few years".  One of the locals took a razor
blade and got "Buy in a few years".

He put it up over the Scandinavian District Manager's office, (but
said he'd probably take it down before the manager came back from
vacation.)

Speaking of "gitlaid", I'm told that a number of years ago, some unknown
person rearranged the sign outside of the Parker Street facility so that
it read "gitlaid".  It was put back the very next morning, and the sign
altered to make it much more difficult to do such things.  Presumably,
all the other signs scattered around New England were also secured.

This rumor is from a mostly reliable source; can any of you out there
corroborate it?

Many DEC product announcements make the newspapers, and most even make the
computer magazines, but it is rare to see a non-technical publication pick up
on a DEC product introduction, especially so when they don't just crib from
the press release.

Therefore, it was with total astonishment that I read the following item in
the "Talk of the Town" section of the January 2 New Yorker:

Voices from Nowhere

Out there on the frontier, smack up against the great or ghastly
unknown, it can get, oh, so very quiet.  Sometimes the only sound is
your heartbeat. (Sometimes there are chain saws.)  But stay out there
long enough and it's a sure bet that you'll begin to hear voices.
Voices that belong to no man. Voices from Nowhere.  These last weeks,
we've spent a little time with the pioneers on America's newest
frontier- the uncharted wilderness of high tech. And we've heard some
voices.

To operate DECtalk, a new way for computers to talk with an unlimited
vocabulary, you type the words you wish to hear on a keyboard -
"Fourscore and seven years ago," perhaps - and then hit the return key.
 Instantly, in the unmistakeable tones of an inebriated Swede speaking
English, DECtalk delivers your message.  Larry Twaits, the DECtalk
product manager at Digital Equipment Corporation, was standing on the
sidelines at the press conference where DECtalk announced its entry
into the market.  How, we asked him, did the four-thousand-dollar box
of logic circuits - chips, bits, bytes - learn to talk?

"It was like magic," he said, and for a second we understood.  But
then Twaits launched into a long and devious spiel about "computer
models of the human vocal track" and the calculation of sixteen
variables, including the size of sinus cavities, and by the time he
was done we were reduced to asking, "Can it sing?"

Yes, this one can, provided you request "Strangers in the Night".

A roomful of adult reporters listened respectfully as DECtalk showed
off at its press conference.  It spoke in five of its eight voices (an
extended family of soused Scandanavians, from a grade-schooler named
Kit the Kid right up through Frail Frank, a senior citizen), and
recited "Peter Piper picked" at three hundred and fifty words per
minute, and introduced a lot of Digital Equipment executives, none of
whom performed tongue twisters or anything else.  Instead, they talked
about bisynchronous terminal support, and the automated office of the
future, and the awsome number of potential applications for DECtalk,
which is being used at the Children's Hospital in Boston to speak to
young children who are non-speaking or have very severe speech
difficulties.

When the press conference ended, we sidled up to a keyboard and put
the machine through its paces.  "War is peace," it burbled dutifully.
For a moment, we couldn't think of anything else we wanted it to say,
but only for a moment.  We carefully selected Voice Four, Uppity
Ursula, typed in our message, and then leaned back to hear her say, "I
find you fascinating and handsome- indeed, the fairest of them all."

This is an odd one, but if you've been living on your own for awhile
now, it may not yet have dawned on you that a room with curtains or
drapes is a happier room than one without.  Even if everything you
own is sitting on the floor, filling in the windows makes a real nice
change.  And it's warmer and saves heat.

I know DESPERADO is not an advertising medium. However, there are occasions
when rules pale by comparison with reality!  One such happened to me lately,
and I'd like to share it with my fellow DESPERADOS.

I recently bought a condo in south Nashua.  I needed drapes, so I
looked in the yellow pages. By chance, I called an outfit called A.C.
ROMER "hand made, not factory made".  The Czech craftsman brings a
selection of 8000 fabrics, many of them hand-screened  East European
and Scandinavian designs.

I'd looked in Boston and NYC and seen very little of comparable
quality.  What I did see of the quality was priced at $1500 - $2000,
exclusive of installation for a "whole wall" (12').  This guy charges
$400.00 installed!!! The drapes are measured to the millimeter; two
matching cushions and a "snake" are included.  The workmanship is
INCREDIBLE!!!  There are NO seams on the outside; the lining is so
thick that the glass sliders steam up after five minutes... And get
this: he brings you a bottle of vintage (1974) Isreali wine that he
admonishes you to drink only on XMAS or EASTER!

Anyhow, I'd like to tell you that this is the first time I've bought
anything in the USA that was really well made!  Apparently the wife
sews the drapes and cushions...

A. C. ROMER is listed in the yellow pages under "Drapes."  Give him a
call -- you're in for a very pleasant surprise.

PS: If you don't believe me, feel free to call me at work (1-1337) or
send MAIL.  My place is across the street from ZK.  I'd be glad to
show you.

Subject: Trying to find an S.F. short story... HELP!

I'm trying to locate a science fiction story (it appeared in a
collection of short stories) that had the following plot elements:

        1)      Took place in the future.
        2)      The hero was sent out from earth in a single-man
                "spaceship" on a mission of general discovery
                (The spaceship is in quotes because it was more than a
                spaceship.  It was an extension of himself).
        3)      He was the symbol of the best that could be achieved by
                man (and knew it).
        4)      He could go anywhere and do anything and thought that
                he was virtually a God.
        5)      Needless to say he came across an intelligence that
                swatted him out of space like a fly and completely
                humiliated him.. stripping him of everything including
                his humanity.
        6)      Most of the story focuses on him as an animal regaining
                some semblence of concious thought and eventually
                defeating the alien that had tried to crush him.
        7)      At the end he returns to earth in the aliens' ship.
                However, due to what he's been through he is no longer
                really human, and everyone else knows it.

Does it ring a bell for anyone? It was one of the most powerful short
stories I ever read... and of course I neglected to write down the title
or authors name. My guess is that is was written in the 50s or early
60s and the version I read was in hard cover.
