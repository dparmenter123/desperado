Subj:   all browsers all the time

 Here's the deal.  I shoot my half-baked opinions about this and that
 out to the world and I get other opinions, some fully baked, back.  I
 then bundle all the more interesting opinions into one message that
 you can delete without reading if you care nothing for, in this case,
 browsers, whereupon you won't know what's going on.  Read on and you
 will know more, at least about NetScape, than I did, and, at the end,
 a pointer to another browser, besides the Quarterdeck one I am
 fiddling with.

Subject: Why Netscape is winning
To: desperado@world.std.com

Tom,

Glad to see desperado is back.  I was starting to suffer from a
pith-shortage.

Your comments about Netscape finally pushed me over the edge, forcing
me to break lurker mode.  First, I'd like to list the reasons why I
think Netscape is capturing the browser market (and from recent stats
I've seen, something like 90% of the people browsing the web are doing
so via Netscape).  Next, I'll explain what I've heard about Netscape's
``corporate strategy,'' and why I think it's probably a win.  Finally,
I'll offer a few opinions about Mozilla (the Netscape browser),
Trumpet Winsock, Windows, and the notion of a universal,
self-installing browser.  I'm offering these comments from the
perspective of a web-developer who is unaffiliated with Netscape,
Inc.

o Why Netscape is capturing the browser market

There are two aspects to this issue.  The first aspect is the
perception of speed due to Netscape's incremental display of HTML.
An HTML document consists of a bunch of text intermixed with markup
tags.  Some of these markup tags refer to non-text objects (especially
pictures which are to be displayed in the document).  Formatting and
displaying the text requires the browser to figure out the size and
location of these objects.

Two ways of formatting this output are: 1). start at the begining of
the document, format text until you get to a picture, download the
picture, place the picture, and continue formatting the rest of the
document, or 2). do a pass through the text, read only enough header
information from the pictures to figure out how big they are and where
they should be placed, format all of the text, then go back and read
in and place the pictures.

Both methods require roughly the same amount of work to fully display
an HTML document.  However, downloading text is cheap (wow, a
character is only 1 byte, how's that for a bargain?) and downloading
pictures is expensive.  The result is that a browser that formats and
displays the text first will present the user with a lot of
information in a relatively short time.  Whereas, a browser that
formats the text in one pass will display some information, go away
for a god-awfully-long time, display a picture and some more text, and
generally lurch along in an unpleasant manner.

Further, many pictures (interlaced GIFs) can be displayed
incrementally.  The browser paints the entire picture with big, blocky
pixels, then repaints the picture with smaller pixels, then with
smaller pixels, etc. as more data is read.  If you already have the
text, and you don't care about the detail on the picture, you can
abort your download and happily surf to the next document with a
minimum of hair-pulling.

A browser that incrementally displays an HTML document will *appear*
to be much faster than a non-incremental browser.  Mozilla was the
first browser to support full incremental display, and most of the
early netsurfers migrated to Mozilla because of this.

OK, so now you have a bunch of people who are using your browser, how
do you keep them from switching to a freeware product when the
freeware product gets around to incorporating incremental update as
well?  Answer: You introduce a lot of new markup tags that aren't part
of the formal HTML specification.  If you're clever, you choose ones
that people really want to use like centering things on the screen
(hard to believe it's not in the original spec, isn't it?) and tables.
If you're an evil bastard, you choose ones that are slow irritating
eyesores that people really want to use like colorful backgrounds,
server-side pushs (which allow sloooooooooow animations), and (arg)
blinking text.  You can also extend the syntax for existing markup
tags to allow things like scaling of pictures.  Since you don't
document these extensions until AFTER your latest beta version of the
browser supports them, everyone else in the browser biz is always
playing catch-up.

HTML authors now have the choice of: 1). only using the boring old
markup tags that are supported by the slow clunky freeware browsers
that only 10% of the market are using anyway, 2). creating two
versions of all of their documents so that both types of browsers are
supported, or 3). including all these nifty tags in their documents
and saying ``If this page looks funny to you, you're not using &lt;a
href="http://home.mcom.com"&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;.''

Turn to the dark side of the force, Luke.

Now when all of those poor (l)users without Netscape look at one of
those pages, it looks really, really bad.  And, often, they're just a
click away from being able to download Mozilla.  Cool marketing
gimmic, eh?

I imagine that eventually Netscape will run out of useful new tags to
add to the HTML spec.  At that point, their edge will evaporate.
But, this probably won't happen for years, and by then no one will
even bother trying to compete.

This is why I think Netscape is winning the browser market.

o Netscape's corporate strategy and why it's probably a win

Oddly enough, Netscape isn't planning on getting rich from the browser
market.  They're planning on getting rich from the server market.
Here's how they just might be able to do it.

First a little technical handwaving.  A hypertext link has a URL
(universal resource locator) associated with it.  The URL specifies
how to fetch the resource, what host machine provides the resource,
and where the host should look for the resource.  When you click on a
hypertext link (or press a button in a form) your browser opens a
connection to an HTTP server running on the host machine and sends the
URL to that server.  Then, the server interprets the URL, fetches the
appropriate resource, and ships it back to your browser.

Given that there are already a bunch of not-bad freeware servers (I'm
running a CERN server at my site, for example), why would anyone in
their right mind spend 4-5K (!!) for a Netscape server?  There are two
reasons, one not-so-important one and one killer.  First, the
not-so-important reason: speed.  The Netscape server is supposed to be
very fast.  If you're a big site and you're getting tens of thousands
of hits per day, you want a server that's not going to load your
system.  But, CERN httpd or NCSA httpd are fast enough for most sites,
so I don't think that's a real killer.

The real killer is secure transactions.  If you're a business and you
want to sell things over the net, you probably want customers to give
you their credit card numbers.  Now we all know that with the
gigabytes of information floating over the net on a daily basis the
odds of someone sniffing out that one tiny packet with your credit
card number in it are pretty managable.  But, your average consumer,
who doesn't know doodly squat about computers, can easily be persuaded
that this danger is HUGE AND TERRIFYING and that if the
anarchosyndicalists get ahold of your credit card number, you might as
well kiss the dog, wife, house and kids goodbye and book a one-way
ticket to skid-row.

So, if you want consumers to give you their credit card numbers, you
have to be able to assure them that those pesky anarchosyndicalists
won't be sniffing out their credit card numbers.  One way of doing
that is via encoded (and, therefore, presumably secure) transactions,
preferably with something really strikingly graphic like a BIG BLUE
LINE across the top and bottom of a secure HTML document and like a
little KEY icon or something that's displayed ALL the time at the
bottom of the browser window and it's always broken unless you're in a
secure transaction and then it's a WHOLE key in a bright blue box.
Boy, you KNOW you're safe when you get that WHOLE KEY thing.  Ahem.

So, let's reason it out.  Mozilla, the Netscape browser, supports
secure transactions when transacting with a Netscape Secure Server.
Presumably, the protocols for these communications are
Netscape-proprietary, so they can't be engineered into the freeware
servers.  Next, you know that 90% of everyone and his mother are
using Mozilla.  Finally, you know that no one is going to buy anything
&gt;from you over the net unless your server will engage in secure
communications with their browser.  It doesn't take an Einstein to
figure out what server you want to be running if you want to do
business over the web.

And, by the transitive property of perversity, if you're using a
non-Netscape browser and you want to buy something over the net, and
all of the businesses are running Netscape Secure Servers, you
probably go click click and run Mozilla yourself.

So, this is why I think Netscape's corporate strategy is probably a
win.

o Gee, but you have to do all this black magic with Trumpet Winsock
and such if you want to run Mozilla, and why can't someone just sell
me something that I don't have to be a black magician to install?

I've installed TIA, Trumpet Winsock, Netscape, and a lot of other
Internet apps on PCs, and MacTCP, MacPPP, InterSlip, Netscape and a
lot of other Internet apps on Macs, and I can tell you:

Blame the Internet Service Providers.

(or, alternatively, Blame the TCP/IP RFCs).

Netscape allows you to send mail, so if you want to send mail with
Netscape then Netscape needs to know what machine is running your mail
server (all those mumbles about a POPer and smail).  Netscape also
allows you to read newsgroups, so if you want to read news with
Netscape then Netscape needs to know what machine is running your news
server (the mumbles about NNTP).  Getting TCP/IP working requires that
you either have a PPP or SLIP (or ethernet) connection to a host
machine (the mumbles about Trumpet Winsock, Microsloth Network, and
TIA).  Your TCP/IP stack also needs to know about your IP address and
where the server is for domain name lookup.

These are all different (and often in non-obvious ways) for different
internet service providers (ISPs).  So, your universal network thingie either
needs to know about all of the different ways that the ISPs have their
systems set up, or all of your ISPs need to be set up the same way.
Eventually, market pressures will force the ISPs to standardize, and
internetting a box will be a no-brainer.  Until then, there will be no
universal network thingie.

o Back to lurk mode.  Thanks again for a great list.

&gt;  I celebrated the metastasis of Netscape by downloading the

&gt;  particularly in URL management.

Sod that, check this one out: http://www.twg.com for Emissary, and it
should make you faint if you can get past the occasional crashes...
&gt;
&gt;  To install Netscape I had to acquire Netscape, Trumpet Winsock,
&gt;  TIA, and four "helper"utilities and then engage a guru to link
&gt;  them all together.  This is not a three-billion-dollar product, it is
&gt;  a rinky-dink app that can't stand alone for a second.  Of course, to
&gt;  install the Quarterdeck Suite I need to find out something about a
&gt;  bunch of stuff I have only vaguely heard of, my "servers": POP, SMTP
&gt;  and NNTP, and plug 'em in to an installation procedure that tells me
&gt;  nothing about any of these things.

Hmm. Look around for Slipknot; it's a stand-alone browser with a TIA-like
thing and a stack built in. Just dial up your service provider and go.
