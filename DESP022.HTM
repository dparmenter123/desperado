                        ANOTHER REVERSED BACKUP

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
All replies to #1002, except those below, were on the volume to be
backed up, which, unfortunately, was confused with the output volume,
with the unfortunate result that some old disk from last month now
appears where yesterday's disk used to be.  There were some real
winners there, so if you remember what you sent me, send it to me
again.

                              BONUS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
In lieu of all the fascinating stuff now buried on the lost disk,
here's a Desperado bonus.

How to spell privilege.

After 43 alternate DEC spellings of this difficult word, the following
has been chosen as the best:

                      P-R-I-V-I-L-E-G-E

Use this spelling in code, error messages, and documentation.

You may find the following easy-to-remember mnemonic phrase useful:

        Put rice in Vivien's isolated lodge, easing Gene's egress.

Thank you very much.

Webster's Second Unabridged Dictionary included a picture of an
unmistakable Harley-Davidson in its definition of motorcycle.  In
Webster's Third (the current one) there is no picture of a motorcycle,
but further down on the same page there is a picture of an unmistakbly
home-made motor scooter, with a wooden box enclosing the engine.

Although I may be merely exposing my ignorance, I have found it
difficult to imagine anyone using a VAX to run a refrigerator. The
first thing that comes to my mind when I hear about the smaller VAXes
is that they would be ideal for military applications.

Is DEC trying to enter a new market?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
What *would* a "smart" refrigerator do that the present stupid ones
don't do?  Replace missing ice cubes?  Keep the beer at 50 degrees and
the meat at 32?  How many bits would it take smarten a refrigerator?
How much memory?

Subject: Candidate for sickest DCL programming technique

$! This command file demonstrates an unusual DCL programming technique - a
$! method (NOT recommended for general (any?) use) for testing Boolean condi-
$! tions several times.  Thus, suppose &lt;cond&gt; is a condition and &lt;s1&gt;, &lt;s2&gt;,
$! and &lt;s3&gt; are to be evaluated if and only if &lt;cond&gt; is true.  The following
$! code will do this:
$!
$!      $ Bool = "!"
$!      $ IF &lt;cond&gt; THEN Bool = ""
$!      $'Bool' &lt;s1&gt;
$!      $'Bool' &lt;s2&gt;
$!      $'Bool' &lt;s3&gt;
$!
$! Warning:  You can't conditionalize occurences of things like 'f$verify(0)'
$! this way (i.e. "apostrophed" lexical functions with side-effects).
$!                                                      -- Jerry Leichter

$ TrueBool = "!"
$ if (1 .eq. 1) then TrueBool = ""
$ FalseBool = "!"
$ if (1 .eq. 2) then FalseBool = ""
$'TrueBool'     write sys$output "You should see this"
$'FalseBool'    write sys$output "You should NOT see this"
$'TrueBool'     goto foo

On the recent "Chronicle" broadcast about personal computers, Peter
Mehegan mentioned that some of the newer entries to the p.c. market-
place are coming from DEC, Wang, and Data General, three companies
"right here along Route 128"; ... 0 for 3, Peter.

Subject: Comment on Chronicle's CT coverage

        I didn't catch the Chronicle coverage of the CT, but a non-DEC
   friend of mine did.  She was amazed when she heard, several times,
   something to the effect that the engineering team isn't down in the
   dumps after completing this project (CT) because they were now working
   on a better version.  Her observation was that this was not a very
   clever thing to say because prospective customers would just wait for
   the better version and not buy this one.

        On another note.  Can someone clarify what the word "Indian" means
   in these two phrases: "We are having an Indian summer" and "You are an
   Indian giver"?  Is this another ethnic slur?  Are there any more uses
   of the word "Indian" like this?  What does this say about our perception
   of the natives of this land?

        [For a man from Maynard, you sure ask alot of questions!]

        Is it true that Parmenter's first name is Alien?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I think my name is Kermit.

"Indian giver" is what we did to the Indians, not what they did to us.
We just blamed them for it.

Or, it could be a reference to differing ideas about personal property
among the Indians, such as the potlatch, at which an Indian displayed
his wealth by giving away everything he owned.

I don't know about "Indian summer".  I do know that Indian summer
comes in the fall.  What we are having now must be Indian fall.
