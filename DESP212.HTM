        I don't care if you're a hawk or dove, humanist or hardware freak,
        didn't it make you want to puke to hear that the stock market shot
        up 70 points because the war began?

        We'll start our Persian Gulf coverage with a *brilliant* twist on
        flag-based protest, segue into an amazing Hunter Thompson
        prediction and wander on from there.

        This is one of those times when I start wishing I was still a

        consensual death.

Subj:   Wash your flag.

My husband Michael &amp; I went to Washington on Saturday (1/19) - it was an
exhilarating experience, full of hope &amp; creativity. This was my favorite
bit:

 As the huge crowd assembled in Washington's Lafayette Park (across the
street from the White House) for the demonstration on January 19th, Mike
Havenar of Central Valley, NY was attracting his own crowd-within-a-crowd
with a tin tub half full of sudsy water, an old-fashioned washboard, and
a flag.
 "So many people burn the flag!" he said "Hell, that's suicidal. You
should wash it! It says the same thing! The flag is dirty! Ever since
criminals like him" here he pointed to the White House "started *wrapping*
themselves in it!" The crowd laughed and shouted encouragement as he
knelt and started to vigorously scrub the flag.
 "They can't pass a Constitutional Amendment to keep you from *washing*
the flag" he said as he squeezed out some suds. "Hmmm... I seem to have
gotten a few stains out... but there's a lot of blood on this flag.
Gonna take something a little stronger to get it all out. Acid, maybe..."
which drew another laugh from the crowd.
 Finally he rinsed it a last time and said "Now it's cleaner than that
one up there", pointing to the White House flag. Someone in the crowd
suggested he wash that one, too, and he answered "Yeah, I'd like to."
 "As a great American - Abbie Hoffman - once said, "Hey, it's my flag,
too!" and that drew some sustained applause. I felt like we had somehoe
reclaimed something that the "my country right or wrong" folks had
symbolically claimed for their own.
 He had someone from the crowd help him fold the flag, correctly and
respectfully, and a couple of people helped him carry the tub along to
the next spot in the crowd.
 A good message, I thought - don't burn America... clean up our act...

        "Just in case you are interested, on the army radio, which we
        listen to constantly now, and anyway they play great music, every
        morning they have a time which is directed to children.  Yesterday
        they told the children here that right now some of the most
        unfortunate children in the world are the Iraqui children.  And
        that is probably true."

        It is difficult for the ordinary voter to come to grips with the
notion that a truly *evil* man, a truthless monster with the brains of a
king rat and the soul of a cockroach, is about to be sworn in as president
of the United States for the next four years....And he will bring his
*gang* in with him, a mean network of lawyers and salesmen and pimps who
will loot the national treasury, warp the laws, mock the rules and stay
awake 22 hours a day looking for at least one reason to declare war,
officially, on some hapless tribe in the Sahara or heathen fanatic like the
Ayatollah Khomeini.

Subj:   The Gulf War Party Game

The order of channel-hopping is NBC, ABC, CBS, and CNN, at each commercial,
unless otherwise indicated by further rules, the channel is changed.

If you hear someone on TV say "scud," take a swig of beer and change
the channel except during scud attacks (see below).

If someone says "Patriot," everyone in the room must salute.  The last
person to salute takes a shot.

If a scud attack is reported, everyone must hold their breath.  The first
person to breathe must go to a sealed room while everyone else takes a shot.
That player remains in the room until the "all clear" is sounded.

If someone says "somewhere in eastern Saudi Arabia" everyone must shout
"Dhahran." The last person takes a shot and must forego the next "scud."
The same applies for shouting "Riyadh" upon hearing the phrase "a large
airbase in central Saudi Arabia."  Anyone naming the wrong city must
also take a shot unless they shout "Taif" before they are called on the
error.

Whenever Wolf Blitzer appears on the screen, everyone must shout
"woof woof" and drink a wine spritzer.

A shot of Kahlua and coffee is kept on the table.  Whenever the phrase
"ground war," "ground assault," or "ground attack" are used, the first
person to grab the shot gets it.

Every time Dan Rather says something stupid, all shout "change the
channel." The last person to do so takes a shot and is forced to watch CBS
on another TV until the next "scud."  I realize that this one is a judgement
call, but the odds are that it won't be long before he says something
stupid anyway.  Of course, if Sam Donaldson is on ABC change the channel
immediately but I probably don't have to tell you that.

Subj:   for Desperado -- a sex scandal in the Bush administration?

I've noticed that you, as an old real-newspaper type, retain your fondness for
the printed press.  So I thought that you might be amused by something that
caught my eye last week.

The Jerusalem Post has the distinction of being the finest English-language
newspaper in the Middle East.  This makes them the largest fish (almost the
only one) in a very small pond, and this lack of competition causes their
standards to vary somewhat.  The edition of December 21, 1990, carried an
analysis article about the change in the relative importance of Greece and
Turkey in U.S. foreign policy, as a result of the current situation in the
Persian Gulf.  The following was supposed to give an example of this change:

        Turkey turned the spigot on Saddam's oil, a deed which warmed the
        cuckolds of Bush's heart and prompted a pledge of immediate financial
        and military aid.

The mind boggles.

The following are somewhat different from the other set of Murphy's Laws of
Combat that I've been seeing.  Dunno where these started either, but I got
them from

NUAGES::BASSINNE "RMS-E-OK_RNF, non-existent record successfully accessed"

who doesn't claim to have originated them.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

                   ***Murphy's Laws of Combat***

1.  If the enemy is in range, so are you.

2.  Incoming fire has the right of way.

3.  Don't look conspicuous, it draws fire.

4.  There is always a way.

5.  The easy way is always mined.

6.  Try to look unimportant, they might be low on ammo.

7.  Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are dangerous.

8.  The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions:
        a. When you're ready for them.
        b. When you're not ready for them.

9.  Teamwork is essential, it gives them someone else to shoot at.

10.  If you can't remember, the claymore is pointed at you.

11.  The enemy diversion you have been ignoring will be the main attack.

12.  A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.

13.  If your attack is going well, you have walked into an ambush.

14.  Never draw fire.  It irritates everyone around you.

15.  Anything you do can get you shot, including nothing.

16.  Make it tough for the enemy to get in and you won't be able to get out.

17.  Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.

18.  If you are short of everything but the enemy, you are in a combat zone.

19.  When you have secured an area, don't forget to tell the enemy.

20.  Never forget that your weapons are made by the lowest bidder.

        Someone posted a blank "Things to Do" sheet across from our coffee
        machine. Within one hour, someone had filled in the first blank
        with "Make a list of things to do".  Within two hours, someone else
        had added, "Cross each item off the list as you do it" and then
        crosseä out both lines.  It stayed that way for a couple of weeks,
        thån someone wrote in "Rest on your laurels", followed by "Take a

                       THE SOLUTIONS TO ALL OUR PROBLEÍS
                                 (GUARANTEED!)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The following is "Michael Ventura's handy list of 34 simple (but not easy)
solutions for everything that ails the world".  Ventura is a novelist.  The
list originally appeared in his column in the L.A. Weekly, followed by Utne
Reader, and then somebody typed it into a file and now it's going
everywhere, including here.  Tom Blinn sent it to me.
ü|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Ét's happened once too oæten.  Somebody says or writes to me, "You talk
  about what's wrong but you don't offer solutions."  And maybe they're
  right.  Maybe to merely detail one's vision and let readers take it from
  there isn't enough.  Maybe there *are* solutions, and maybe I *should*
  know them.  So I sat down and thought about things real hard, and here,
  numbered for your convenience are my solutions to everything.

  00.  Indulge in secrets.  Without one or two major secrets, your life
  will surely fade.  (If you're over 40 and don't understand this...you're
  in âig trouble.)  A conundrum:  secrets aren't lies - they're mysteries,
  havens, passageways.  Lies wreck your life; secrets can save your life.
  But sometimes you have to lie to keep the secret.  Uh-oh.

  1.  Make mistakes.  As jazz saxophonist Coleman Hawkiîs said, "If you
  don't make mistakes, you aren't really trying."

  2.  Stop lying about yourself.  To yourself.  To your friends.  To your
  family.  To your business associates.  Maybe even to your enemies.  (Your
  enemies can oppress you just as much by forcing you to maintain fidelity
  to your own lies as by any other means.)

  3.  Stop tolerating in your leaders what you wouldn't tolerate in your
  friends.

  4.  Tolerate impurity.  Trying to be pure about *anything* is a way of
  setting yourself up to fail.  Asking other people to be pure is a way of
  setting them up.

  5.  Read one book a month - a book that you didn't find out about in a
  magazine or newspaper.  Browse an independent bookstore and wait til some
  book says, "Read me," and then read it.

  6.    Listen to the voices.  The wee inner voices.  (The voices make
  mistakes sometimes, but they don't make *boring* mistakes.)

  7.    Leave people alone when they tell you to leave them alone.  (Note:
  This rule applies to grownups only.)

  8.    Don't make the "sophisticated" error of thinking that a negative
  voice is automatically smarter than a positive voice.

  9.    Eat healthy food but don't be a fanatic about it.

  10.   Don't be a fanatic about *anything*.

  11.   Do only exercises that take you somewhere.  Walk, ride a bike,
  roller-skate, swim.  All other exercise is ego- and/or fear-driven, and
  if you listen to ego and fear you will drown out the voices you most
  need.

  12. Don't run.  Really, *don't*.  America likes to run because running
  from (fill in the blank) is what we do best.  Everybody who runs is
  running away from something terrible.  Stop running and find out what's
  behind you.

  13.   Eat Italian food.  Italians went from being oppressive Roman
  conquerors to being the inefficient, wonderful Italians they are today.
  It's probably the food.

  14.   Order my novel _Night Time Losing Time_ (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989) at
  your local independent bookstore.  (This won't solve the world's problems
  or yours, but it'll do wonders for some of mine.)

  15.   If you're living in a place (like Los Angeles) where driving is
  necessary, learn to drive.  You may think you know how, but my experience
  of the way you drive is that you probably don't.  So here's how: Drive
  for space, not for speed.  Space in front of you is the safest thing you
  can have with a car.  Darting in and out of traffic doesn't change
  anything, it just makes you older.  You can't beat the average traffic
  flow on any given street or freeway by more than five minutes, which only
  makes a difference if you're having a baby.  And don't you feel like an
  idiot when you've passed six cars and they pull up beside you at the next
  light?

  16.   Dance.  Jesus said, in one of the Gnostic gospels, "He who does not
  dance does not know what happens."

  17.   Don't worry so much about being fat.  Fat feels great in bed.

  18.   Look into people's eyes when you talk to them.

  19.   Have candlelight in your life.

  20.   No matter how rushed your schedule is, spend at least five minutes
  in the morning quietly in bed with your loved one just being gentle
  together.  Perhaps drinking tea.

  21.   Tell your mother and father, individually - and your children, if
  you have children - what you *really* think.  Once a year, minimum.  If
  more people did this, it would save more lives than arresting drunk
  drivers.

  22.   Do not avoid the eyes of the homeless.

  23.   If you think something's wrong - at work, in your family, in your
  self, in your country - agitate for change.  If you won't do that, it
  doesn't matter how tan you are.

  24.   Tape this quote to your bathroom mirror:

  "One can only accept in others what one can accept  in oneself."  - James
  Baldwin

  25.   Don't talk down to kids.

  26.   Don't chicken out about sex.  Given that you're with a consenting
  adult, do whatever you fantasize.  This is much more important than
  quitting smoking.

  27.   Watch at least one black-and-white film per month.

  28.   Regarding number 6:  Entertain the notion that there are...voices.
  Some come from within, some from the plants and objects and such around
  you, and some come from what I call, for shorthand purposes, the
  Infinite.  If you don't listen for them, your life will be more difficult
  than it has to be.

  29.   Pay more taxes - and insist that those taxes, and the taxes you
  already pay, go for education.  Giving the young a lively, thorough,
  truthful education is the most important *environmental* issue today,
  even more important than acid rain, tropical rain forests, and ozone
  holes.

  30.   Let me make that a lot clearer.  Recycling and shopping
  ecologically are almost pointless when one-third of California's
  high-school students drop out, and most who graduate can't read much.
  How can these people inherit a world?  Even if we give them a greener
  world, are they equipped to keep it that way?  You want a solution, so
  here's a solution:  Take to the Streets for the Education of the
  Children.

  31.   Pray

  32.   Stop looking for other people to supply the solution.  *You're* the
  solution.  If you're not, there is no solution.

  33.   Be aware of the Network.  We live by a network of connections and
  links.  Your connection to yourself, to your intimates, to your place, to
  the collective, to the planet, to the Infinite. (Each is a distinct
  connection.)  Equally powerful are the collective's connections to you
  (not at all the same as yours to it), to groups of intimates, to itself,
  to the planet, to the Infinite. All the links or connective points of
  this network (call them the acupuncture points of our universe) both take
  and generate energy.  Any link out of sync weakens the others.  (The
  West, for instance, has concentrated too much on the individual, the
  East, too much on the collective; both approaches have been catastrophic
  on every level of the network.)  This network, from you all the way to
  the Infinite, is a living whole, ceaselessly changing.  Some of these
  changes take millions of years.  Some happen instantaneously. May the
  links of the network shine.

When the cheerleaders at Valdosta High (which really did play Waycross, and
everybody else, just for practice, since we were far and away the best team
in Georgia), did the cheer in the headline, they poked out their chests on
the "peaches" line, then turned around and flipped their skirts up on the

I have my second-edition (1970) copy of HoToGAMIT (How To Get Aound MIT),

comment on page 120 a page of "Tech Cheers", one of which reads:

They are printed in a typeface which looked old to me even in 1970, which
makes me think they date back to the 1930s or earlier.

I had a friend at MIT who told me that his high school football (?) team's

passers in its conference.  This year, they didn't win much (like about
3 games)... but that's still not too bad for its third year as a
varsity team.  And, with a budget of $15K (not including the coach's
salary), and NO overnight trips allowed (league rules), I'd say that
a bunch of people, many of whom have never played football before, are
getting a chance to have a hell of a good time.

Burma Shave signs began appearing in 1926 in Minnesota to direct people's
attention to a new shaving cream that did not need a brush.  In 1963,
Philip Morris Inc. bought Burma-Vita (the parent company of Burma Shave),
and the new owners replaced them with more conventional forms of advertising.
Here is a short sampling of signs, most written by the original company's
owner, Allan Odell.

Every shaver
now can snore
six more minutes
than before
by using
Burma Shave.

Are your whiskers
when you wake
tougher than
a two-bit steak?

The answer
to a maiden's prayer
is not a chin
of stubby hair.

Does your husband
misbehave
grunt and grumble
rant and rave
Shoot the brute some
Burma Shave!

Soon shaving brushes
will be trimmin'
those screwy hats
we see on women.

'Twould be more fun
to go by air
if we could put
these signs up there.

Special seats
reserved in Hades
for whiskered guys
who scratch the ladies.

No lady likes
to dance or dine
accompanied by
a porcupine.

Safety experts praised the signs, citing that most people slowed down to
read them.  Odell wrote a few explicit safety jingles, like these:

Don't take the curve
at 60 per
we hate to lose
a customer.

Past a schoolhouse
take it slow
let the little
shavers grow.

Car in ditch
driver in tree
moon was full
and so was he.

Most of the signs were meant to be humorous, such as these:

Rip a fender
off your car
send it in
for a half-pound jar.

This sign prompted many users to send in toy car fenders, which amused the
Odells greatly.  That is, until the crates of real car fenders began to
arrive.  They received 25 fenders, so they mailed out the half-pound jars.

Free, free
a trip to Mars
for 900
empty jars.

This sign also got a response many years after it appeared.  Someone had
saved 898 jars, and planned to arrive in Minneapolis shortly to take his
trip to Mars.  Odell wrote up a new jingle and quickly had this set of signs
made up:

If a trip
to Mars you'd earn
remember, friend
there's no return.

If you don't know
whose signs these are
you can't have driven
very far.

After most of the signs had been removed, Odell sent a special set of signs to
the Smithsonian:

        Shaving brushes
        you'll soon see 'em
        on the shelf
        in some museum.

Subj:   RE: Burma Shave signs

One I remember from somewhere in the heartland:

        In this vale
        Of toil and sin
        Your head grows bald
        But not your chin

And a Mad Magazine parody:

        Her guy's whiskers
        Just don't faze her;
        He shaves by
        Electric razor.
        What's the need for
        Burma-Shave?

I suspect many more of your readership will contribute...

One of my husband's favorite T-shirts (bought at a science fiction
convention) shows a space scene, with a goofy little rocket passing a
sequence of little planets that have signs on them:

Space is big
space is dark
it's hard to find
a place to park
Burma Shave

I had a favorite Burma Shave signset, made special to me for obvious reasons:

He lit a match
to see his gas tank
that's why they call him
Skinless Frank.

That may explain my aversion to shaving.

The following is too good not to repeat even though I'm not supposed to
according to the rules, so I'll just cover up where I got it from and then
it'll be hard for anyone to know just which rules I'm breaking.

    I just took a customer on a tour of our brand new office here in
    W*nn*p*g.  As we passed the washrooms. I remarked that they conformed
    to DWA (Digital Washroom Architecture).

    The customer, completely serious, told me that he felt that Digital had
    taken the concept of architectures too far.

Subj:   re: KLUGE (Desperado #3038)

    While on a visit to Sig Manufacturing Co. out in the middle of
Iowa (to us, it was the "Balsa field of dreams"), I saw a pair of
Kluge printing presses in operation. Your description of the press
operation seems to fit what I observed. At the time we had no idea
that this might be the source of the term, and got a good laugh from
the name.

    BTW, the presses were not printing, but had been modified to die
cut balsa parts for model airplanes. This beast would pick up a
sheet of balsa from the input hopper, fling it across to the bed,
slam the "plate" down onto the sheet, and then pick up the cut sheet
of airplane parts and put it into the output hopper. It did require
constant human guidance to keep it feeding the much heavier than
paper sheets, perhaps adding to the name.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Continued US superiority in the aviation industry -- superiority in
technology, reputation, and sales -- is so complete that it extends even to
these balsa planes which are the best, and the best-selling, in the world,
far superior to those things made out of coffee-cup poly.

Subj:   More news of the Weird from All Over

Dear Tom (My Bdy) Parmenter:

Desp #3038A's mention of the putatively real group "Buck Naked and the
Barebottom Boys" brought to mind a competition held about 5 years ago
in my family for the Best Ostensible Singing GroupName.

I won, I'm proud to report -- but I've *never* bruited it about,
outside the family, yet, having thrown caution to the winds --

with this winning entry:

                       ''"Shake" P&amp;n!s &amp; the Gonads''

I'm of two minds on whether or not to request that my name not be
published with this, should you Find it Worthy of a future issue.  On
balance I'd prefer to see the item but not my name...  That way I can
get the same anonymous thrill I got upon seeing folks break up while
reading the shortest obscene graffito I have ever perpetrated.

Some years back, at the start of the jogging craze, someone had posted
one of those wacky articles from the New England Journal of Medicine
entitled

"Penile frostbite:  An unforeseen hazard of wintertime jogging"

My graffito consisted of a carat between the s and the second e of
"Unforeseen" with a K interpolated above it.

Subj:   Speaking of misprints of the Bible...

This was taken, without permission, from "Good Omens:  The Nice
and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch" by Neil Gaiman
and Terry Pratchett.  For you Pratchett fans, it is easily the
best thing since his early Disk world stuff:

... published in 1651 by the London puglishing firm of Bilton and
Scaggs.

It had been the first of their three great publishing disasters.

The book was commonly known as the Buggre Alle This Bible.  The
lengthy compositor's error, if such it may be called, occurs in
the book of Ezekiel, chapter 48, verse 5.

2. And bye the border of Dan, fromme the east side to the west
   side, a portion of Afher.

3. And bye the border of Afher, fromme the east side even untoe
   the west side, a portion for Naphtali.

4. And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side untoe the
   west side, a portion for Manaffeh.

5. Buggre Alle this for a Larke.  I amme sick to mye Hart of
   typesettinge.  Master  Biltonn if no Gentelmann, and Master
   Scaggs noe more than a tighte fisted Sothwarke Knobbeftike.  I
   telle you, oneea a daye laike this Ennywone withe half an oz.
   of Sense should be out in the Sunneshain, ane nott Stucke here
   all the livelong daie in thif mowldey olde By-Our-Lady
   Workeshoppe. @  *"@;!*

6. And by the border of Ephraim, from the east fide even untoe
   the west fide, a portion for Reuben.

[Who cares about sun.  The worst day of skiing is better than the
best day of working.  My version of the sentiment expressed in
5.]

For those interested, the other two publishing disasters were the
loss of a copy of Shakespeare's Lost Quartos and the publishing
of a completely accurate and more or less understandable book of
prophecy.  There ought to be a terrible pun in there somewhere,
"profits without loss in their own time"

Read the book.

        And so we arrive, precipitately once again, at the end, that is to
        say, the stopping place, for another Desperado.  God only knows
        where the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame piece got to, there were 4000
        lines in this file when I went to work on it and now it's beaten
        down to about 25 per cent of that because I wanted to get going on
        the Gulf stuff.  One of my books of military strategy explains that
        it is now politically incorrect in this region to refer to the
        largest body of water anywhere nearby by its legal name, which is
        the Persian Gulf, for fear someone will think the Gulf somehow
        belongs to Iran (which took over the Persian franchise some years
        back, as close readers of Desperado will recall).  So, "the Gulf"
        it is, although Floridians and Texans have no such problem with the
        Gulf of Mexico (which is a bigger gulf anyway), and what if someone
        should get the idea that all the oil in "the Gulf" belonged to the
        Gulf Oil Company.  Dear me.  Only the English call it the English
        Channel, but the Pakistanis don't worry much about the Indian
        Ocean.
