As part of the celebration of the PDP-11's 15th anniversary, a PDP-11
TRIVIA night is planned for Fall DECUS.  The plan is to provide a
large hall in which PDP-11 buffs (DEC and customers) will gather, be
divided into teams, and play a trivia game in which all questions
pertain in some way to PDP-11s.  I think it's going to be one, big
game with a large "board" at the front of the room and tokens moved by
a Master of Ceremonies.

Current thinking is that the board will somehow be centered on the
Mill, and the goal will be to reach the clocktower.  But we are open
to suggestions.

What we need most of all is questions (and answers).  If you can think
of any good ones that somehow pertain to 11s, please send them to me.
Also please send any suggestions you may have about the design of the
game or how it should be played.

Fall DECUS is in Anaheim, December 9th to 13th.  Of course,
we need to have this thing all designed and ready to go well before
then.

PUMA'S COMPUTER RUNNING SHOE MEASURES PERFORMANCE ELECTRONICALLY

An electronic device attaches to the left foot of Puma's RS Computer
Shoe, measuring distance according to the runner's own calibrations
and sensing footfall. After a run it plugs into a computer to read out
detailed performance data and comparisons with pre-set goals.

Puma's RS Computer Shoe comes with its own electronics and software to
document individual runners' performance. It has a built-in electronic
device that communicates with a personal computer, allowing runners to
electronically measure the time, distance, and energy and/or calories
expended on each run.

It will retail for $200, packaged with the software, the electronic
measuring device and the plug that connects shoe and computer.
Replacement shoes, which, like the original, represent Puma's top of
the line, will retail for $90.

The same software program can be used by an unlimited number of
runners who wear the computer shoe model. The software can access a
file containing information on each individual's running performance
before calculating the distance and caloric measures. This aspect is
expected to provide teams and groups of individuals with an important
motivational and training tool, according to Puma executives.

Information stored in the shoe can be accessed right after a run or
stored indefinitely in the device as long as the shoe is not turned
off.

The shoe itself, including the device, weighs approximately 13 oz. It
will initially be introduced in men's sizes from 6 to 13. ...a women's
version is also scheduled for production in 1986. ...Puma has similar
devices for other shoe products on the drawing boards.

                XEROX ANNOUNCES HYPER-ETHERNET

SAN FRANCISCO, CA., Jan 7, 2010 -- Xerox today announced Hyper-Ethernet,
their fourth generation local area network.  In addition to its ability to
transmit text, data and images, Hyper-Ethernet enables the tranmission of
people.  "People transmission over Hyper-Ethernet," according to Michael
Liddle, V.P. of Office Systems, "will greatly reduce elevator congestion
and eliminate the need for video conferencing."  Order taking for Hyper-
Ethernet will begin next month.  Installation will start in Los Angeles in
the Third Quarter.

In a related announcement, Wang Labs, headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey,
announced Super-Hyper Wangnet, their twelfth generation local area network.
According to Freddie Wang, President of Wang Labs, "Super-Hyper-Wangnet will
not only transmit people over the Wangband, but will also transmit furniture
and buildings over the interconnect and utility bands.  These additional
capabilities of Super-Hyper Wangnet are vital to the emerging office of the
future."  Order taking for Super-Hyper-Wangnet will begin next month.  In-
stallation has already occurred worldwide.

IBM Corporation, who has been rumored to be announcing a local area network
since 1980, was not available for comment.

                Life in the Fast Lane - By John Burgess

If you're like me, your brain has to be jump started each morning with
several  jolts  of  high quality caffeine.  I'm not talking about pre-
ground pre-packaged name brand coffee sold in supermarkets.  My engine
runs  on  high octane:  fresh whole beans from Colombia, Brazil, Java,
fat as your thumb, bursting with the black essence of caffeine.   Make
no  mistake;  the  perfect  cup  of  coffee  is a daily grind, in your
electric grinder, using top quality beans.

For the discriminating bean fiend who needs high performance fuel  in
his  tank,  a  trustworthy  source is essential.  Fortunately, I have a
friend in the bean trade who  deals  nearby  -   Al.   Al,  himself  a
notorious  bean  fiend,  stocks  only  #1 quality coffee beans from an
American wholesaler known as First Colony.  Beans of every  persuasion
can  be  found in this multinational colony, from Java to Jamaica, and
French Brandy to Swiss Chocolate.  With such  selection  each  morning
can  be  addressed diffferently.  A subtly nut-flavoured cup of Kenyan
to ease you into Thursday, or a full twelve volt boost of French Mocha
to stand you up on a Monday.

My monthly trek  to  Al's  bean  barrels  is  a  ceremony  steeped  in
tradition.  The door chimes jingle as I walk in.  Al looks up from his
place behind the counter and smiles.

"There he is," he says.

I accept a cup from Al's ever  present  house  pot,  and  discuss  the
merits of his latest experimentation.  Then, I move to his barrels and
set to work.  After years of tasting different combinations, I believe
I  have  arrived  at the ultimate blend of beans.  One part Colombian,
one part Java, one part  Bourbon  Santos,  then  three  full  measures
French  Mocha.   Finally,  la  piece  de resistance:  Four measures of
First Colony's coconut flavoured beans.

Yeah! Fresh ground and brewed with a filter-drip system,  you  have  a
bracing potion; full-bodied, invigorating, subtle as a runaway moose.

"So they haven't got you yet, have they?" Al says.

Al is referring to the  Mellow  crowd.   While  coffee  has  risen  to
prominence  as  a  serious pleasure, worthy of refinement, the Mellow-
heads, who are coffee's nay sayers, have become increasingly vocal.

"I hear they're agitating for separate Mellow Sections in  restaurants
and public places," I say.

"Mellow Sections?" Al is aghast.  "Non-caffeine areas.   Hyperactivity
not allowed. My God.  Who will stop them?"

I shake my head sadly.  The Mellow-heads have been getting  a  lot  of
air  time lately.  These are the commercials where you see people with
perpetually windswept hair and  golden  tans  walking  around  beaches
looking serene.  The key to maintaining this comatose state is to drink
a freeze-dried concoction from which 97% of  the  raison  d'etre  has
been removed.

"When will come the day each package of coffee contains a warning from
the Surgeon-General?" Al continued.

"Tell me, Al," I said, digging out a scoop of  Java,  "have  you  ever
wanted to go mellow?"

My question seemed to catch him by surprise.   He  continued  weighing
beans  and  tallying  on  the  cash register, saying nothing.  Then he
looked up.

"Yes John, there was once a time."  He paused a moment, polishing  his
glasses.   "It happened years ago when I worked at a shoe company.  My
boss suggested I was acting edgy and irritable  because  I  drank  too
much  coffee.   I  responded  by breaking a chair over his head.  They
took me to a Caffeine Dry-Out Center.  Somewhere in the wilds north of
Barrie."   This  was unexpected.  I listened in fascination as Al told
of six weeks of caffeine cold turkey,  forced  tanning,  exercise  and
meditation classes.

"You wouldn't have recognized me when I was released,"  Al  continued,
"My  only concerns were good vibes and the right kind of margarine.  I
returned to my job in  the  city.   On  a  ten-speed,  of  course.   I
immediately  began  organizing  an  exercise  break to replace morning
coffee breaks, and took a collection for gym equipment.  I  encouraged
others  to get in touch with their auras.  When called upon  to give a
comment on a sales project, I would answer, "For sure, I think I  know
where  you're  coming  from."  My friends couldn't stand it.  Finally,
one day my secretary offered to refill my Sanka cup.  She put  in  the
Sanka  all  right,  then poured black coffee on top of it.  I drank it
without noticing.  Suddenly, a hot flash electrified  my  brain.   The
scales   fell   from   my  eyes,  self-realization  possessed  me.   I
immediately strode into my boss's office and broke another chair  over
his  head.   Then  I  left for good.  I set up my little retail outlet
here shortly after."

"Wow! That's some story, Al," I marveled.  "What  was  it,  your  great
realization?"

He spoke with conviction.  "Mellow is excruciatingly dull."

"I'll drink to that," I said.  We clicked our styrofoam cups together,
and swigged.

"Yep," said Al, "it feels good to be alive."

vague instruction: "Write a package that will draw pretty pictures
of data structures in the form of directed graphs."  What you wind
up with is GRAPHER.

Stanley Rabinowitz, known as STAN to millrats, has been hacking
for DEC since 1972.  His earliest hack was to make PS/8 look like
TOPS-10; however he has not yet succeeded in making VMS look like
TOPS-20.  An avid SF nut, his null job under RTS/8 played the theme
music from Star Wars on the console speaker of the PDP-12.
Many DECies have tubed for days on his SCRABBLE(R) program.
He has written a SNOBOL compiler for VMS in his spare time,
but rumor has it, that he is really a TECO macro.  He is well-known
for his WHAT program and rules MATH.NOT with an iron hand.  He can
be found late at night marauding the ENET making network maps.
GRAPHER was one of his most recent hacks, although the project was
funded by the STRB and is currently under consideration for becoming
a product. When he is not programming, Stan likes to sleep, eat, and read
note files.

Subj:   Unix nightmare

**********************************************************************
Last night I dreamed that the Real World had adopted the "Unix
Philosophy."

I went to a fast-food place for lunch.  When I arrived, I found that
the menu had been taken down, and all the employees were standing in
a line behind the counter waiting for my orders.  Each of them was
smaller than I remembered, there were more of them than I'd ever seen
before, and they had very strange names on theuir nametags.

I tried to give my order to the first employee, but he just said
something about a "syntax error."  I tried another employee with no
more luck.  He just said "Eh?" no matter what I told him.  I had
similar experiences with several other employees.  (One employee
named "ed" didn't even say "Eh?," he just looked at me quizzically.)
Disgusted, I sought out the manager (at least it said "man" on his
nametag) and asked him for help.  He told me that he didn't know
anything about "help," and to try somebody else with a strange name
for more information.

The fellow with the strange name didn't know anything about "help"
either, but when I told him I just wanted to order he directed me to
a girl named "oe," who handled order entry.  (He also told me about
several other employees I couldn't care less about, but at least I
got the information I needed.)

I went to "oe" and when I got to the front of the queue she just
smiled at me.  I smiled back.  She just smiled some more.  Eventually
I realized that I shouldn't expect a prompt.  I asked for a
hamburger.  She didn't respond, but since she didn't say "Eh?" I knew
I'd done something right.  We smiled at each other a little while
longer, then I told her I was finished with my order.  She directed
me to the cashier, where I paid and received my order.

The hamburger was fine, but it was completely bare... not even a bun.
I went back to "oe" to complain, but she just said "Eh?" a lot.  I
went to the manager and asked him about "oe."  The manager explained
to me that "oe" had thousands of options, but if I wanted any of them
I'd have to know in advance what they were and exactly how to ask for
them.

He also told me about "vi," who would write down my order and let me
correct it before it was done, and how to hand the written order to
"oe."  "vi" had a nasty habbit of not writing down my corrections
unless I told her that I was about to make a correction, but it was
still easier than dealing directly with "oe."

By this time I was really hungry, but I didn't have enough money to
order again, so I figured out how to redirect somebody else's order
to my plate.  Security was pretty lax at that place.

As I was walking out the door, I was snagged by a giant Net.  I
screamed and woke up.

Surely there was one staunch Wagnerian in your company to remind the
MCP's at Port Talbot of the lovely Welsh soprano, Gwyneth Jones.  Jones
is the one who sang Brunnehilde in the PBS telecast of the "Ring" (as
performed at the Bayreuth Festival), and probably comes as close to owning
the role as anyone.  Also, I believe Margaret Price is Welsh.  There must
be others, but those two occurred to me immediately.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The fault is mine -- I should have made it clear that it's
CHORAL singing Welsh women don't appear to do, but the soloist is alive and
well. At our Welsh concert, there was a stout soprano soloist bedecked in
sequins who sang any number of coloratura heart-tuggers and who announced,
before the clapping had gone on for more than ten seconds, that she was going
to sing an encore -- as Anna Russell says "Whether you want her to or not!"
For tuppence, she would have sung the Jewel Song from Faust.

Your mention of Sabena, the Belgian airline, reminds me of a comment made by
Roger Gascoigne, who is also a Desperado and who lives in Reading, England.
He says SABENA is really an acronym:

        Such
        A
        Bloody
        Experience
        Never
        Again

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Sabena is notorious -- I got that acronym from a few sources. I will say that
except for the food, Sabena beat Air France. How many airlines have
you travelled with where the stewardesses refuse to tell you when the plane
is due to arrive?

British Airways continues to serve delicious cold salads and cups of tea. A
new trend is the predominance of handsome young men over pretty young ladies
when it comes to flight attendants. And all of them polyglot as hell.

I've received a wonderful travelogue about Kenya that I'm saving up for you
for a special treat. Thanks to all who sent kind words about the European
ramble-on.
