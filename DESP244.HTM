        If this is the last you'll see of me before the election, don't
        forget to vote early and often and, in between, lie to pollsters.

Many of us in Colorado are a bit shell-shocked by the effect of lots
of people lying to pollsters. All of the polls showed Amendment 2
getting defeated. Apparently, the only explanation anyone believes
is that people lied to the pollsters. The projections definitely
softened the anti-2 forces and their ability to raise money. Now we
are trying to live with the consequences.

Subj:   [sic]

        Being the word wienie that I am, I can't resist pointing out that
        the interjected [sic] does not mean "This is an error."  The
        translation of the Latin word "sic" is "so" or "thus".  In English
        and American usage, it means "This is exactly how it was written,
        so don't correct it."

        So (or thus) when [sic] appears after an error, it should be
        indicating, "Yeah, yeah, I know it's wrong", not "Look at what a
        yoyo this type is and, conversely, how smart I am."

Though I am a supporter of prescription (rather than description) in word use,
I believe you are shouting into a vacuum here.  No matter how much we might
want to use [sic] to mean "This is intended -- not an error" or "I found it
this way, think about it before whining about errors", it is most used
by editors and morons (i.e. Usenet responders) to imply that a typo is really
an indication of the original writer's low intelligence.

The weight of empirical evidence indicates that [sic] *actually* means "Look
at what this fool wrote -- ain't I sumpin'?."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Actually I am a descriptionist trapped in a prescriptionist's body.
        It's okay.  We have this little club where we can get together and
        be ourselves.

        A major symptom of this condition is that even though I know that
        the battle is lost and "loan" is now synonomous with "lend" and
        that the genius of the language has decreed it and that it is good, I
        still cringe and mentally correct it.  I also know that a "hat" is
        a head-thing with a brim and a "cap" is a head-thing with no brim
        or only a bill, but I still call obvious baseball caps "hats" and I
        still cringe every time I do it.  I also cannot hear "dove" used as
        the past tense of "dive" without hearing my old editor Arnold
        Dornfeld pontificating, with a long "o", that "a dove is a bird".

        So, my purpose in sticking by my guns on [sic] was not to get the
        world to change, but to extend the community of those who will
        analyze a [sic] and say, not "ain't that guy sumpin?" but rather
        "that guy thinks he's sumpin with his [sic], but I know he ain't
        nothin really".

        Besides, the complaint I was answering was about a [sic] that had
        been used *perfectly*, so there.

Vibrating one's eyes is not that hard -- all it takes is muscle tension of the
sort you use to misalign (cross) one's eyes horizontally.  It certainly isn't
as hard as misaligning them along the *vertical* plane (which I believe is
impossible.)

    Buck Naked 1954-1992

    In the very wee hours of last Saturday morning, we lost one of the
    greatest showmen the Bay Area has ever known.  Philip Bury, known to
    most folks as Buck Naked, was shot twice in the chest while walking his
    dog. The alleged murderer was a crazed pigeon lover who thought that
    Buck's dog, a Rottweiler named Reno, was going to scare his precious
    winged rats. One terrible instant of insanity snuffed out the life and
    dreams of a man who worked only to bring joy, laughter and great
    entertainment to so many people for so many years.

    Buck Naked moved to San Francisco from Omaha, Nebraska, in 1986 with
    his band, the Barebottom Boys: Hector "Bobo" Naked (Buck's brother,
    Stephen Bury) and Stinky La Pew (David Wees). Their wild and raunchy
    shows, R-rated song titles and unbridled rock and roll passion quickly
    gained Buck and Boys a huge local following.  They drove their
    audiences into fevered frenzies, egged on by Buck's hollering about his
    "Jellyroll" and "Teenaged Pussy from Outerspace".  Buck's costumes were
    an ever-evolving work-in-progress, everything from glittering G-strings
    to ALF puppets to Happy Meal toys garbed Buck's loins in the days
    before he settled on his now legendary plunger.

    I'll admit that Buck had a few detractors -- Larry Lea damned Buck as
    one of the demons haunting the city when he did his big Halloween
    exorcism of San Francisco in 1990....

    As loud, leering and ostentatious as Buck Naked could be on stage, the
    real Buck was a much different person.  That man was quiet, thoughtful
    and creative, driven to succeed as an entertainer.  He constantly
    perfected his Buck Naked act while maintaining roles in his other
    bands, the Dandelions, the Peckerwoods, and Pearl Harbor.  When he
    tended bar at the Paradise Lounge he always dispensed a lot of smiles
    and kind words along with the drinks.  Buck was a star, a
    perfectionist, a dreamer, a baseball fan, a cartoonist, a health
    fanatic, a humorist, and an animal lover.  But above all he was a
    wonderful friend to all who knew him.

Buck Naked killed in Golden Gate Park

San Francisco (AP) --
The leader of a ribald rockabilly band known for its raunchy lyrics and
outrageous stage costumes was shot and killed while walking his dog in
Golden Gate Park, authorities said.

Phillip Bury, 38, leader of the band "Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys,"
was shot after an alleged confrontation with a man who was feeding pigeons
in the park Saturday, police said.

Police said they arrested Michael Kagan, 37, who is known for confronting
people whose dogs might frighten the3 birds.

"This guy feeds the pigeons every day.  He seems to have problems with dogs
that might chase the pigeons," said homicide inspector Earl Sanders.

Sanders described Bury's dog, a Rottweiler named Reno, as a big but
nonthreatening dog.  Reno was taken to the shelter of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Bury started the band in 1984 with some friends from Omaha, Neb.

Bury's performance included stripping down to just a cowboy hat and a
toilet plunger covering his private parts.

Gilbert Klein, a friend of the band members, described the band as
providing "good-natured, porographic rock... but nothing lascivious.  I
mean, women loved it.  Buck wasn't a misogynistic kind of person.  I don't
thing anyone got offended at Buck's stuff."

Bury is survived by his parents, two sisters and a brother.

The band was hoping to come out with an album next March, said brother
Stephen Bury, a band member.

"Buck was actually in the studio just three nights ago putting the
finishing touches on the last two vocal tracks," he said.

He said the band appeared live on Joan Rivers' television show in February
of last year when she was featuring the "most outrageous bands in the
world."

Bury adopted the name "Buck Naked" when he and his brother, whose stage
name is "Hector Naked", and David Wees, started the group in Omaha from
what was left of an earlier band.  Wees was known as "Stinky LePew."

"We were in a tragically stupid new-romantic band, basically bogged down in
technology, and we all got sick of it one day and said, 'This is really
stupid, let's strip down the music to its bare minimum,' two acoustic
guitars and some drums," the brother recalled Saturday.

George Lazaneo, a road manger who traveled with the band last year, said
the band drew well in the Midwest and "had a cult following."

"All of the songs they did are about sex or sexual gratification -- tongue
in cheek," he said.  "They call it pornobilly."

Subj:   Desperado #3071

Hi Tom,

I hope you are doing well.  I have to comment on something from today's
Desperado #3071:

&gt;    "Where *did* Prof. Vrsalovic get that Kalashnikov AK-47?"

I never heard of Prof. Vrsalovic, but I can tell you a couple things about him.

The line above is excerpted from a fabricated story in Desperado, but it has
a tie to serious reality.

It used to be that nobody here but us Southern Slavs knew where Croatia
and Serbia were.

My father's family is Croatian.  They left Zagreb around the turn of the
century.  Yugoslavian names can often be identified: Ruzich might also be
Ruzick or Ruzic.  Thus, Mike Bilandic (who was Mayor of Chicago) is
clearly a Croat.  The Yugoslavian "vic" or "vich" ending, on the other
hand, tend to be Serbian.

When I was in music school, I recall talking to a cute French horn
player named Stephanie Mihalovich.  We had each other's ethnic
background pegged immediately.  When I confirmed that my name was
Croatian, and asked about hers, she jokingly made a sneering "Nyahh",
and then we both smiled.  We were aware of the historical antagonism of
our ancestors, but were far enough removed from it, that it was an easy
joke between us.

It's no joke today.

My father, who is a retired history teacher, was always amazed that Tito
kept Yugoslavia intact for decades.  Given the unremitting blood and
barbarism in evidence today, Tito's balancing act seems even more
improbable.

All the Croatians I've ever dealt with are the most easygoing,
accepting, agreeable, low key people.  My father is truly the nicest guy
I've ever met.  The American Serbians are great, and we know a nice
Slovenian woman in Nashua, married to a French Canadian.  I absolutely
fail to see anything in Americans of Yugoslavian ancestry which relates
to the daily horrors in the newspapers.  Maybe all the non-violent
people left to work in the steel mills and coal mines of America.

Anyway, if Prof. Vrsalovic has recently come from Yugoslavia, it does
not stretch reality to suppose he would be familiar with an AK-47.  The
only surprise is that he didn't leave it at home so his relatives could
kill more of mine.

-Steve

Subj:   Mouscatel and other adventures in alcoholism

    Christina suggested I get my after-dinner coffee somewhere she could
    smoke. What with one closed place and another, we ended up at the bar
    of Monsoon, a no-longer-trendy generic-Asian restaurant.

    Along with coffee and dessert, I ordered a shot of moutai.  Moutai is a
    horribly expensive (at this place, anyway) moonshine made by burying
    sorghum in a pot for a couple of dynasties.  "You like that stuff?"
    asked the Vietnamese bartender.  I said it was OK.

    Christina tried a sip when it came and thought it was very grappa-like.
    But I thought that overstated the case. Grappa tastes like
    formaldehyde, whereas moutai tastes more like athletic supporter aqua
    vit.

    I waxed philosophical on how awful it would be if we couldn't taste
    things. Christina brought up the sad case of Marianne, who, knocked off
    her bike by a car, stunned the olfactory portion of her brain against
    the curb. She was then able to drink an entire bottle of sweet vermouth
    straight.

    The bartender came back and asked how we liked the moutai.  I said it
    was OK.  He said he had something for me to taste, and set a shot glass
    and what looked like a split of cheap rice wine on the counter.  At
    first I thought there were shrimp in it, sort of like the pear in that
    yummy French liqueur.  He poured a shot.

    Christina asked what it was called.  The bartender said "Rat wine, I
    guess."

    Sure enough, on a closer look (but not too close), what were bobbing at
    the bottom of the bottle were actually a half-dozen baby white rats.

    The bouquet was chitinous, but the taste was basically off-dry rice
    wine with a heavy dose of mustiness. Not a bad concretion of the smell
    of a mice-ridden granary.  Very nostalgic for an old country boy like
    myself.

    The bartender thought it was supposed to be medicinal. The Chinese do
    so many things with herbal cures. For example, he'd seen a similar wine
    based on ginseng and snake. He believed in Western medicine, but there
    was no doubt the Chinese had learned a lot after thousands of years of
    herbal medicine.  He'd heard about this woman who started to lose her
    sight three months pregnant.  The Western doctor told her that either
    she had to lose the child or become blind.  But the Chinese doctor gave
    her some stuff to drink and her eyesight came back and she carried the
    child to term.  The Western doctor was astonished.

    I wondered whether any ritual similar to the swallowing of the mezcal
    worm had built up around rat wine.  Christina pointed out the neck of
    the bottle was too narrow.

                                SKETCHES OF SPAIN

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        We went on the same day to El Escorial and La Valle de los Caidos.
        El Escorial is a monastery and  palace of gigantic proportions
        built by Philip II.  La Valle de los Caidos is a memorial of
        gigantic proportions built by Francisco Franco.

        El Escorial is laid out in the form of a gridiron in honor of San
        Lorenzo, now one of my favorite saints.  In his martyrdom, Lorenzo
        was grilled to death, fettered to a gridiron over hot coals.  His
        last words were "You can turn me over now, I'm done on this side."

        In the library at El Escorial, all the books have their spines
        turned inward and their titles lettered on the edge of the pages.

        Deep below El Escorial is the Panteon where Spanish kings and
        queens are buried amidst black marble and gold tracery.
        Incredibly, amazingly, Francisco Franco actually expected that he
        was going to be buried there as well.  I'm no monarchist, but
        Franco was, and how he could have thought for a minute that they
        would plant him there is beyond imagining.

        Franco is, in fact, planted in La Valle de los Caidos, which means
        the Valley of the Fallen.  This is supposed to be a memorial to
        all who died in the Spanish Civil War, but since it was built by
        political prisoners working as slaves at a cost of 8000 lives,
        everybody considers it a falangist memorial only.   Franco's grave
        is just a plaque on the floor with not even a rope around it.

        There's an expression in Spanish, "¡que barbaridad!", which is
        generally taken to mean "how awful!", but La Valle de los Caidos
        is an out-and-out barbarity.  The valley itself is beautiful,
        filled with pines and Russian olives with a wonderful romantic
        peak at the end.  Atop the peak, a 400-foot cement cross.  Dug
        into the peak, a cathedral, built to be longer than St. Peter's
        until the pope told them they couldn't and made them shorten it by
        building a wall about a quarter of the way back.  In the
        cathedral, guarding it, two falangist angels six meters high with
        grim stern expressions and three-meter swords.  "The totalitarians
        always want to have the swords," my host told me.  "The
        totalitarians always need the swords," I replied.

        We had the good fortune to witness a high-society wedding in the
        cathedral at El Escorial and with the mighty organ booming it was
        a thrilling experience.  I doubt if anyone ever got married in the
        cathedral of La Valle de los Caidos.

        My hosts did not feel comfortable discussing the place while we
        were there even when there was no one near us.  My hosts were a
        Spanish doctor and his wife, our former tenants, who had grown up
        under falangism and celebrated its fall.  The doctor's brother
        thinks the whole memorial should be blasted away, but he felt it
        was so ugly and distasteful that it should be allowed to remain.

        We skipped riding the elevator to the top of the cross because we
        were all weirded out, so we scooted to Segovia to sip beer in the
        shadow of the 2000-year-old Roman aqueduct, which is still ducting
        aqua to the city.
                                    =*=

        I got a sort of taste of falangist Spain riding the train back
        from Holy Toledo.  We were trapped in the car with some Americans
        talking loudly about how rich they were and how all their friends
        were going to ship their money out of the country when Clinton was
        elected and how the Grand Cayman islands were going to sink with
        all their gold.  The little woman (Mrs. Desperado) was holding me
        down in my seat.  It did not occur to me until too late that I
        could have started whistling "Happy Days are Here Again".  My
        hosts said that living under the falangists meant that only
        certain attitudes, opinions, subjects could be discussed in public
        and that those were always smug.

        The twittiest of the three said, "She said she was going to Paris
        for two weeks.  I said I didn't see why you'd want to be there
        more than two days."

        Then these prime examples were joined by two young American women
        who sat down five seats apart from each other in order to better
        share with the rest of the car their reports on the thieving
        Spaniards, thieving gypsies, and thieving Moroccans they'd heard
        about from other tourists.

        Sure, sister, it's fine for you to take your shoes off and put your
        feet up on the opposite seat.  How else could we admire your
        painted toenails?

        This was on our last full day in Spain.  We hadn't really been
        thrown in with any Americans before, which plan I intend to follow
        the next time I go as well.

        The King of Spain said, "Spain does not get the tourists she
        deserves."

        Miros; some more El Grecos.  I never got tired of it.  There
        really isn't anything new under the sun.  These things are as
        modern as they come, the pictorial variant of Ezra Pound's
        definition of literature, "News that stays news."  We saw
        multimedia, we saw existentialist despair, we saw modern horror,
        we saw fantasy, we saw modern art up to 500 years old.

        I've been planning to go to the Prado since I was 19 and bought
        books of Bosch and Goya's "Horrors of War".

        In the Prado there's a picture called "The Milky Way" with Venus
        squirting milk from her breasts to fill the sky with stars.  Not
        by Bosch, but a modern mindblower nonetheless.

        In my rudimentary Spanish I tried to ask about guided tours but
        ended up with a personal guide instead.  If you've travelled
        thousands of miles to see some art and you really don't know all
        that much about art this is definitely the thing to do.  It was
        $40 for 90 minutes, still the bargain of the trip.

Subj:   misc. comments on 3071

in re the destination of expelled Spanish Jews:

     According to an NPR blurb some time ago, many faked Catholicism and
left with the conquistadors, headed for the New World.  They've turned up
in New Mexico and Colorado as Cryptojews (I didn't make this word up).
They practice Catholicism in public, but teach their children Judaism in
private (reporter acoustically cuts to sound of child playing with a dreidl,
singing an appropriate tune).  Details presumably available from knowledge-
able Desperados &amp; other convenient polymaths.

in re Lowell Wood's Megatons to the tune of Camelot, "Nukes Forever!", etc.:

     Once (during a rather dark period) I found a book (in the CU Boulder
library) by Norman Corwin called Overkill and Megalove.  It was a book of
(sometimes lighthearted) poetry about atomic holocaust, including a line
which has stuck with me for a little over a decade and a half:

        Beware updating of a Greek god's gifts

in re mean-spirited anti-republican junk:

(I'm guessing you already knew this, but in case you didn't. . .)

     I find the source of this ironic.  Mr. (P. J.) O'Rourke is not only
very Republican but pretty much a raving imperialist.  His ravings are
quite funny (intentionally so), which is how he makes a living.  His latest
few are Vacations in Hell, Parliament of Whores (about the U.S. govt.) and
Give War a Chance.  Always good for an unexpected viewpoint.  He recently
had a residence in southern N.H. (New Ipswich?), not sure if he still does.

                                                        Robt. P.
                                                        not a desperado, but
                                                        an occasional indirect
                                                        recipient

        DETROIT (UPI) -- An artist who decorated an abandoned house and lawn
with old shoes, tattered dolls and other discarded items, only to
finally have it bulldozed as junk, is a winner of the 1992 Governors'
Art Awards.
        Tyree Guyton, whose art work in his east side Detroit neighborhood
was torn down by the city on grounds it was a neighborhood nuisance,
will receive the Michigan Artist Award at the eighth annual Governors'
Art Awards dinner Nov. 16 at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Gov. John
Engler will make the presentations.
        While acclaimed in some art circles, some neighbors complained that
Guyton's work was a blight on the area.
        The Governors' Arts Award prfogram was established in 1985 by
Concerned Citizens for the Arts in Michigan and Gov. James J. Blanchard
to recognize and honor excellence in the arts. It is desinged to bring
state and national attention to Michigan's arts industry and its
influence on the quality of life.

Subject: DargonZine

                                DargonZine
                    The Magazine of the Dargon Project
                       Editor:  Dafydd &lt;White@DUVM&gt;

   DargonZine is an electronic magazine printing stories written for the
Dargon Project, a shared-world anthology similar to (and inspired by)
Robert Asprin's Thieves' World anthologies, created by David "Orny" Liscomb
in his now retired magazine, FSFNet. The Dargon Project centers around a
medieval-style duchy called Dargon in the far reaches of the Kingdom of
Baranur on the world named Makdiar, and as such contains stories with a
fantasy fiction/sword and sorcery flavor. At this time, DargonZine has no
plans to publish anything other than Dargon Project stories, but there are
several other magazines out there to satisfy this need.

 Subscription Information:

   Subscribers to DargonZine will have each new issue sent to their userid
as it comes out. A subscription may be obtained by sending a request via
MAIL to the editor, Dafydd, at the userid WHITE@DUVM.Bitnet.  This request
should contain your full userid (logonid and node, or a valid internet
address) as well as your full name and the file transfer format you prefer
(either DISK DUMP, PUNCH/MAIL, or SENDFILE/NETDATA (non-BitNet subscribers
only have one option - Mail)).  After that, you will receive all issues as
they are sent out.
   All electronic subscriptions to DargonZine are free and are valid until
either the user requests that they be removed from the distribution list,
or when the user's account is no longer active. It is requested that
readers inform the editor in the event that their account becomes inactive,
deleted, or assigned to a different user.

 Back Issues:

   We once again have a back issue archive. It is at 192.88.144.4
(ftp.eff.org or kragar.eff.org). Use anonymous FTP to get into this site,
and then go to the directory pub/journals/DargonZine. For those of you who
do not have FTP, there is a BitNet site - BitFTP - that will do it for you.
Send it a message saying 'help' for how to use it.  (I will try to produce
a small file of the proper BitFTP commands to get you the issues, so that
if you have trouble, you can just ask me.)  I will personally have
available only the first and the latest issues of the 'zine, due to disk
constraints.

 Submissions Policies:

   As mentioned above, the Dargon Project is a shared-world 'anthology',
and as such it requires a *great* deal of commitment from its writers.
Readers wishing to write for the Project should contact the editor for more
detailed instructions about the background of the Project as well as
plotlines currently in development. Of course, the first requirement for
joining the project is to read all of the Project's output to date to get
to know the characters and world being written about.  Back issues of
FSFNet, the Project's first home, are available from the Listserv@TCSVM
(and FTPable from vm.tcs.tulane.edu (in numbers, 129.81.128.1)).  See above
for back issue information about DargonZine.

Subject: InterText: Call for Submissions

InterText is an internationally distributed magazine of fiction. It is
published in both Ascii and PostScript formats. It is edited by Jason
Snell. And we're always looking for submissions and new subscribers!

For subscriptions, write to me (jsnell@ocf.berkeley.edu) and specify
postscript or ascii. If you can FTP, that would be preferable: just send me
mail telling me you want to FTP, and I'll place you on a mailing list that
will notify you when the new issue is ready for FTPing.

Back issues (at least recent back issues) will appear for FTP on the site:
network.ucsd.edu. they also appear on ftp.eff.org, in the /pub/journals
directory.

InterText is a network-distributed bi-monthly magazine. It's free, and
therefore pays nothing to anyone. It's published in both ASCII (plain text)
and PostScript (laserwriter) formats, and reaches over 1,000 readers in
countries throughout the four corners of the globe.

Anyone can submit a story, regardless of age, race, gender, educational
status, corporate affiliation, etc.

Stories should be under 15,000 words, though exceptions to this rule can be
made.

All genres of writing are acceptable. We've published "mainstream"-style
stories, as well as far-out science fiction. I'd like to keep the magazine
as diverse as possible. Also, it must be original fiction - no use of
copyrighted characters, i.e. Star Trek.

For a writers guide, mail me and ask.

WORLD WAR II: THE MYTH OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

We have all heard the stories about World War II. How the Germans
invaded  Poland.  How the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. How the
"Allied forces" landed  in  Normandy.  How  the  US  exploded  an
"atomic bomb."

One might think that World War II  is  as  factual  as  possible.
Didn't  thousands  fight  in the war and millions die? Wasn't the
war documented in newspaper and radio reports of the day?  Hasn't
there  been copious amounts of literature written about this "War
to End All Wars?"

Recent evidence, however, shows  a  much  different  story.  Most
reputable  historians now discount the myth of World War Two, but
this information is not getting out to the public.

PEARL HARBOR

For most Americans, World War II really started with the supposed
Japanese  "bombing" of Pearl Harbor. However, noted professor Dr.
Ploktin Qwerty, an  expert  of  Japanese  aviation,  has  written
extensively  on  the capabilities of 1940's vintage Japanese Zero
bombers.

"They couldn't reach Tokyo from  Osaka,  let  alone  Hawaii!"  he
wrote  in  his  1984  article for the Journal of Historical Fact.
"Given their wingspans, method of  propulsion  and  payload,  the
only  way  they  could  have  reached  any U.S. territories is as
submarines![1]"

FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS

Serious  historians  now  agree  that  the  supposed  "first-hand
accounts"  of  soldiers  who  are alleged to have actually fought
against  the  German  and   Japanese   forces   are   notoriously
inaccurate.  In  one  celebrated instance, one soldier claimed to
have heard three bombs in ten seconds, and  another  soldier  *in
his same unit* claimed to hear only two! [2]

University of Chattanooga Professor Ernest W. Wykol has gone back
and  examined  the  barracks  where  American  soldiers stayed in
Europe. He found such items as pin-up calendars, paperback  books
and  pinochle  decks.[3]  Hardly  what  one would expect soldiers
fighting for freedom and democracy would be occupying  themselves
with.

In fact, evidence is mounting that American  "soldiers"  actually
spent  their  entire  stay  in  Europe  and  the Pacific *playing
cards*. As noted historian Odioun Flatcher has  discovered,  card
playing  was  extremely  popular  in the forties, to the point of
entire newspaper columns devoted to the subject! [4]

THE TRAGIC ACCIDENT

As Flatcher has reconstructed events, the British, French, US and
Germans all sent thousands of "soldiers" to play cards at various
sites in Europe. In one tournament in Lyons, a  tragic  explosion
occurred  at  a  nearby  fireworks  factory, killing and injuring
hundreds of players. THESE WERE THE ONLY CASUALTIES OF "WORLD WAR
II."   The   media  showed  the  injured  and  dead  soldiers  in
photographs many, many times to give the impression  of  a  "war"
with  continuous  casualties.  That  this  is  a myth can be seen
clearly; Flatcher documented one case where the  New  York  Times
showed  a  picture  of  an  injured  soldier on a Tuesday and the
Philadelphia  Bulletin  showed  the  exact  same  picture  on   a
Thursday.

THE KAMIKAZE LIE

It was certainly in the evil media's interest to make the war up,
and  to  make the "enemies" as ruthless and evil as possible. One
notorious example is the lie that Japanese aviators were actually
encouraged to destroy their valuable aircraft (and themselves) by
crashing them into the sides of US ships.

Dr. Rubert Faurr,  a  French  professor  of  basket-weaving,  has
quoted no less an authority than General Douglas MacArthur on his
reaction when he heard  the  first  rumor  about  these  supposed
suicide missions.  "That's ridiculous!" MacArthur exclaimed.

Honest Japanese people will also admit how absurd this claim  is.
The  word  "kamikaze"  actually means "he who herds the sheep" in
certain  Japanese  dialects,  according  to  Japan  expert   Mort
Clondyke.[5]  And  Atoyot  Adnoh,  currently Japanese minister of
history in the Diet,  has  stated  publically  that  "that  whole
episode was really crazy." [6]

THE MYTHMAKERS

As more of these inconsistencies get exposed,  it  truly  becomes
more  difficult  to believe what we have learned in history books
(from companies with names like Simon and Shuster.) It is outside
the  scope of this article to speculate on who could have started
and perpetuated the major myth of this century, but one only  has
to  look  at the preposterous battle cry as the Japanese are said
to have flown over to attack the  most  powerful  nation  on  the
planet:  "Tora[h],  Tora[h], Tora[h]!" It isn't difficult to come
up with the answers.

Just read "The Big Bow Mystery", which if I had a "top ten" favorite
mystery novel list, this book would figure prominently. First off, it was
written in 1895. Secondly, it was written by a man with the lyrical name
of Israel Zangwill. Thirdly, it was some wonderful one-liners.
"He took life very seriously. He never wrote comic verse intentionally."

"There are three reasons why men of genius have long hair. One is that
they forget it is growing. The second is that they like it. The third
reason is that it comes cheaper; they wear it long for the same
reason they wear their hats long. Owing to this peculiarity of genius,
you may get quite a reputation for lack of two pence."

 PRILEP, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Outside a small Macedonian village close to
 the border between Greece and strife-torn Yugoslavia, a lone Catholic
 nun keeps a quiet watch over a silent convent.  She is the last
 caretaker of the site of significant historical developments spanning
 more than 2,000 years.

 When Sister Maria Cyrilla of the Order of the Perpetual Watch dies, the
 convent of St. Elias will be closed by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of
 Macedonia.

 However, that isn't likely to happen soon as Sister Maria, 53, enjoys
 excellent health.

 By her own estimate, she walks 10 miles daily about the grounds of the
 convent, which once served as a base for the army of Attila the Hun.  In
 more ancient times, a Greek temple to Eros, the god of love, occupied
 the hilltop site.  Historians say that Attila took over the old temple
 in 439 A.D. and used it as a base for his marauding army.

 The Huns are believed to have first collected and then destroyed a large
 gathering of Greek legal writs at the site.

 It is believed that Attila wanted to study the Greek legal system, and
 had the writs and other documents brought to the temple.  Scholars
 differ on why he had the valuable documents destroyed--either because he
 was barely literate and couldn't read them, or because they provided
 evidence of democratic government that did not square with his own
 notion of rule by an all-powerful tyrant.

 When the Greek church took over the site in the 15th Century and the
 convent was built, church leaders ordered the pagan statue of Eros
 destroyed, so another ancient Greek treasure was lost.  Today, there is
 only the lone sister, watching over the old Hun base.

 And that's how it ends: No Huns, no writs, no Eros, and nun left on
 base.

The author of this magnificent abomination is Ron Gibson, editorial
manager of Texas Student Publications at the University of Texas.  It
appeared in Mike Kelley's column, to Mike's large credit.

[ I was sending this to another list this morning and thought you
might enjoy it as well. - ced ]

There has been in England, ever since the rise of the
textile industry in Lancashire, a close alliance between
missionaries and the cotton trade, for missionaries teach
savages to cover up the human body and thereby increase the
demand for cotton goods.  If there had been nothing shameful
about the human body, the textile trade would have lost this
source of profit.  This instance shows that we need never be
afraid lest the spread of virtue should diminish our
profits.

            ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   Fans all jammed in tight
            ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
            oooooooooooooooo&lt;A&gt;oooooooooooooooooo   You and three other people
            oooooooooooooo&lt;B&gt; &lt;C&gt;oooooooooooooooo   standing in formation,
            oooooooooooooooo&lt;D&gt;oooooooooooooooooo   arms akimbo, wide stance.
            ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

        The idea is to form a good solid diamond between the four of you
        and then defend it.  A is the point man, B and C define the inner
        space with their inner elbows and the outer space with their
        outers.  D guards the rear.  The wide stance makes it even more
        solid.

        The other folks will *never* figure out what's going on, but
        you'll have air and (literally) elbow room.

        We did this one time and one person ended up in the middle of our
        formation for about 2 minutes, felt vaguely uncomfortable, and
        then left.  Nobody else even tried.  It works even better if you
        put a beer bottle on the floor in the empty space.  Then, when
        anybody comes by, you kindly warn them of the beer bottle, and
        they go away.

        You can do this with three people, but four works better.  The
        first time we tried it, we had only three people, but the person
        standing in front of us figured out something was going on, so we
        recruited him to convert our strong triangle into an impregnable
        diamond.  You can even move the whole structure slowly forward.

        It's an old commando saying:  One person who knows what's going on
        is worth ten who don't have the slightest idea.

        "Arms akimbo", despite the exotic sound, is just plain old English
        for "arms at keen bow", or, more modernly, "arms at acute angles".

        Today's epilog is the motto of a radio program whose tapes are
        being offered through the Signals (public radio) catalog, courtesy
        of JO, another First Amendment geek.

        Anyone ever involved with RSX, VMS, or Windows NT will be amused
        to learn that a new notesfile has opened at DEC devoted entirely
        to Dave Cutler called CUTLER$BRICKBATS$AND$KUDOS.
