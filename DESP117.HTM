Guess what.  Being the irresponsible sort that I am, I think I'll keep
on attributing anonymity to node NEMO and make those folks in Salem
famous throughout the company for their interesting user names and
intriguing Desperado contributions.

Also, while we're on the subject, if you forward Desperado - first-
second- or third-hand (or even moreso) - let me know how many people
you forward it to. This is not an investigation, I just finally
decided to get curious about how many people see this thing.

Subj:   Relation?

I thought you might find the following of interest, even if the man isn't
a relative.  (From the New York Times, Wednesday 26Dec84, "Q&amp;A", by Craig
Claiborne):

Q.      I have noticed that on French menus dishes made with potatoes are
        often referred to as Parmentier.  Why is this?

A.      There was a time during which potatoes were regarded with scorn and
        suspicion; some considered them potentially poisonous.  Antoine-
        Auguste Parmentier was an agronomist and writer who is credited with
        dispelling these notions and popularizing potatoes in France.  He was
        born in 1737.  His date of death is disputed; varying accounts put
        it in 1813 or 1817.  On French menus Parmentier refers to dishes in
        which potatoes play a prominent role as principal ingredients or as
        a garnish.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I don't know if he was a relative, but I hope so.

One of  the neo-Nazis arrested last week for holding up an armored car
was named Denver Parmenter.

I'd like to think Antoine-Auguste was a relative.  Craig
Claiborn didn't tell the best part of the story, which is how
he managed to popularize the potato.  This was in the Napoleonic
aftermath to the French revolution when all sorts of new ideas were
coming to the fore and the common people were rising above themselves.
Uncle Antoine-Auguste tried to get people to eat potatoes, but was
rebuffed because of the 'poison' rap.  So, he planted patches in the
poorer quarters of Paris and had them guarded night and day.  The day
guards were snappy and drove people away, but the night guards were
sleepy and sloppy, per instructions.  The poor people saw the guards
and figured there must be something valuable there and sneaked in at
night to steal the crop.  Thus the potato was popularized.  The French
struck a medal; my mother has a copy.

Incidentally, lots of people think the old-timers were really dumb
because they thought the potato and tomato were poisonous.  In fact,
both are members of the nightshade family, which all look alike and of
which 27 of the 29 members are deadly.  On top of that, new potato
shoots are also poisonous, so the caution was not misplaced.

You might find this material useful for some future DESPERADO,
when things are exceptionally dull.  Please NEMO this if you do
print it: I don't want to be inundated with you-nitpicking-boob
(euphemism) messages.

Yes, it is incomplete. (How can any history of human barbarism
be complete?)  I keep thinking that I'll have the time to
finish it, or at least punch it into some reasonable shape, but
I never do find the time.  I started keeping a list of spelling
atrocities about a year ago, if that's any indication of the
amount of time I don't get to spend on it.

                            DEC STANDARD SPELLOS:
                     The Programmer's Spelling Dictionary

    "Make is possible for programmers to write in English, and
    you will find that programmers cannot write in English."

                            -- a not very old programming maxim

    A typo is a misspelling that results from a slip of the finger on the
    keyboard.  If the author notices the mistake, it gets fixed.  A spello
    is a misspelling that results from a slip of the mind.  If the word is
    then accurately transcribed, the author beams with pride over the
    wording of the document while the reader winces.

    Most readers in this company are reluctant to correct the spelling in
    MAIL, memos, etc., for fear of being labeled "!@#$%^&amp;*ing nitpickers."
    This guide is intended as a self-help manual for all who care.  More
    help is available in the orthography section in the back of a
    dictionary.

    I'm not perfect, either, of course.  Please feel free to complain
    about my sloppy grammar or informal idiom, or even spelling.

    Please do NOT complain to me, however, about RUNOFF's (incorrectly)
    placing two blanks after colons and semicolons as well as at the ends
    of sentences.

    DEC standard spellos (in no particular order)
    --- -------- -------

    KERNAL:  properly "kernel." There is a story, possibly apocryphal,
    that the first several dozen PDP-11/45 front panels had to be replaced
    in the field by field service because the label on the "kernel mode"
    light was misspelled this way.  Sometimes carelessness can cost real
    money.  Perhaps someone who remembers can enlighten us.

    SEPERATE:  properly "separate." A very common spello, not limited to
    computer people.

    PROTOCALL:  properly "protocol." Perhaps there is an image of one
    participant "calling" another that causes this spello.

    SUPERCEDE:  properly "supersede." A well-known file system product
    from this company shipped with this word spelled incorrectly when used
    as a switch for one of the utilities.  Future versions have had to
    support the error made in the first version.  How did it slip by the
    entire programming staff *and* documentation staff *and* all the field
    test sites?

    ITS vs IT'S, YOUR vs YOU'RE, THEIR vs THEY'RE:  the following table
    should clarify the differences.
    Possessive pronouns:

            its             of or belonging to it
            your            of or belonging to you
            their           of or belonging to them

    Pronominal phrases:

            it's            it is
            you're          you are
            they're         they are

    Probably the most common error among these is the use of "it's" where
    "its" is intended.  The "'s" on "it's" looks like the possessive form,
    as in "Charles's," but it's not.  In "it's," it's a contraction.

    FLOURESCENT:  properly "fluorescent," unless you're referring to the
    glowing bread that's always warm from the Yucca Flats Bakery (or the
    cheap imitation from Three Mile Island Bakery).

    ROLL:  common misspelling for "role," "part taken or played by
    someone."

    EDITTING, EDITTED, TARGETTED:  in the U.S.A., forming the participle
    from the present requires doubling the terminal consonant only if the
    accent would then (in the participle) cause the preceding short vowel
    to become long.  This holds true generally for any suffix beginning
    with a vowel.

    Example:  "e'dit" (where the apostrophe indicates an accent) can
    become "e'dited" without a major change of pronunciation.  The "i" is
    still short because there is no accent on the syllable.  On the other
    hand, "re-fer'" cannot become "re-fer'ed" because it would then rhyme
    with "revered." Doubling the terminal consonant yields "re-ferr'ed"
    (rhymes with "absurd"), retaining the short vowel.  Simple, eh?

            PRESENT         PARTICIPLE

            edit            edited, editing
            target          targeted (if you think it's a verb)
            travel          traveled, traveling
            consider        considered, considering
            layer           layered
            differ          differed
            journal         journaled, journaling (if it's a verb)

            club            clubbed
            plan            planned
            pet             petted
            jog             jogged
            defer           deferred
            refer           referred
            confer          conferred
            rebel (verb)    rebelled
            recap           recapped

    This rule differs in the U.K.  and probably in Australia, and I don't
    know about Canada.  In English English, the terminal consonant is
    (almost?) always doubled if it's an L.

    USEABLE, USEAGE:  properly, "usable" and "usage." There is some
    confusion about when you drop the e.  Similar rule to the one stated
    above about changing the pronunciation.  If dropping the e and adding
    the suffix would cause the pronunciation of the ultimate consonant to
    change (from soft to hard c or g, for instance), then don't drop the
    e.

    Keeping the e is quite rare, but mistakes can happen in both
    directions.

    ROOT            NO              YES

    use             useage          usage
    alternate       alternateing    alternating
    practice        practiceing     practicing
    surprise        surpriseing     surprising

    notice          noticable       noticeable
    manage          managable       manageable, management
    knowledge       knowledgable    knowledgeable
    trace           tracable        traceable
    advantage       advantagous     advantageous

    USEFULL:  properly "useful." Yes, a thing that is beautiful is full of
    beauty, but it isn't rendered that way in English anymore.

    PRACTICLY:  properly "practically." The adjective "practical" already
    contains the "-al" suffix, so add the "-ly" to it.  A common error
    modifying words that end in "-ic" or "-ical."

    EXISTANCE, NON-EXISTANT:  properly, these end in "-ence" and "-ent."
    There is a lot of confusion over endings such as "-ent" versus "-ant"
    and "-ible" versus "-able." Often our pronunciation simply doesn't
    reflect the spelling; that's what dictionaries are for.

    Misspellings of this type are extremely common, and our failure to
    challenge them when they appear in writing only perpetuates them by
    misleading a new generation of programmers.  Most of these mistakes
    are just plain careless.

            NO              YES

            existance       existence
            dependant       dependent
            independant     independent
            consistant      consistent (confused with constant?)
            consistancy     consistency
            inconsistant    inconsistent
            primative       primitive (confused with primary?)
            definately      definitely
            visable         visible (confused with viable?)
            flexable        flexible
            devine          divine
            compatable      compatible
            incompatable    incompatible
            occurrance      occurrence

    PRINCIPAL vs PRINCIPLE:  another confusion of endings.  A "principle"
    is an ethical doctrine (and a lot of other things:  look it up); a
    "principal" is a chief actor (and a lot of other things, too).  The
    most amusing misuse I've seen was the resume from the person claiming
    the title "Principle Software Writer." I don't think he/she got the
    job.

    MEDIA:  the plural of "medium." If a software product is distributed
    only in one magnetic form, then it uses "only one distribution
    medium," not "only one distribution media," as is commonly said and
    written.

    CRITERIA, PHENOMENA:  the plurals of "criterion" and "phenomenon,"
    respectively.

    Gross phonetic errors
    ----- -------- ------

    HOMOGENOUS:  properly "homogeneous." The word is supposed to sound
    like "hoe-moe-JEE-knee-us" because it has another "e" in it.  After
    you homogenize ("hoe-MA-jen-eyes") something, such as milk, it is
    homogeneous.

    BEARLY:  properly "barely," as in "Your performance is barely
    tolerable.  If it were any worse, it would be unbearable."

    EXPLANE (for explain)

    MUTE (for moot, which no one understands anyway)

    DEC standard thinkos
    --- -------- -------

    MORE or MOST UNIQUE, MOST FEASIBLE (comparative superlatives)

    COMPRISE:  often used backwards.  "Comprise" is a synonym for
    "include" or "contain" or "embrace." It is not a fancy version of
    "compose." Properly, the whole comprises the parts, just as the whole
    includes the parts.  The parts compose the whole.  The whole is
    composed of its parts, if you like passives (a subject for another
    day).  Yes, a story comprises three parts.  No, the several chapters
    do not comprise the book.

    PROACTIVE (by analogy with reactive, but nonexistent)

    RESPECTIVELY (malapropism for respectfully)

    Now, on the lighter side, we have a poem from a man who knows how to
    do it and simply doesn't want to.

    *The Spell Against Spelling*

            a poem
    to be inscribed
                    in dark places
            and
    never to be spoken aloud

                                    GEORGE E. STARBUCK

    My favorite student lately is the one who wrote about feeling clumbsy.
    I mean if he wanted to say how it feels to be all thumbs he
    Certainly picked the write language to right in the first place.
    I mean better to clutter a word up like the old Hearst place
    Than to just walk off the job and not give a dam.

    Another student gave me a diagragm.
    "The Diagragm of the Plot in Henry the VIIIth."

    Those, though, were instances of the sublime.
    The wonder is in the wonders they can come up with every time.

    Why do they all say heighth, but never weighth?
    If chrystal can look like English to them, how come chryptic can't?
    I guess cwm, chthonic, qanat, or quattrocento
    Always gets looked up.  But never momento.
    Momento they know.  Like wierd.  Like differant.
    It is a part of their deep deep-structure vocabulary:
    Their stone axe, their dark bent-offering to the gods:
    Their protoCro-Magnon pre-pre-sapient survival-against-cultural-odds.

    You won't get ME deputized in some Spelling Constabulary.
    I'd sooner abandon the bag-toke-whiff system and go decimal.
    I'm on their side.  I better be, after my brush with "infinitessimal."

    There it was, right where I put it, in my brand-new book.
    And my friend Peter Davison read it, and he gave me this look,
    And he held the book for a little while and said, "George..."

    I needed my students at that moment.  I, their Scourge.
    I needed them.  Needed their sympathy.  Needed their care.
    "Their their," I needed to hear them say, "their their."

    You see, there are SPELLERS in this world, I mean mean ones too.
    They shadow us around like a posse of Joe Btfsplks
    Waiting for us to sit down at our study-desks and go shrdlu
    So they can pop in at the windows saying "tsk tsk."

    I know they're there.  I know where the beggars are,
    With their flash cards looking like prescriptions for the catarrh
    And their mnemnmonics, blast 'em.  They go too farrh.
    I do not stoop to impugn, indict, or condemn;
    But I know how to get at the likes of thegm.

    For a long time, I keep mumb.
    I let 'em wait, while a preternatural calmn
    Rises to me from the depths of my upwardly opened palmb.
    Then I raise my eyes like some wizened-and-wisened gnolmbn,
    Stranger to scissors, stranger to razor and coslmbn,
    And I fix those birds with my gaze till my gaze strikes hoslgmbn,
    And I say one word, and the word that I say is "Oslgmbnh."

    "Om?" they inquire.  "No, not exactly.  OSLGMBNH.
    Watch me carefully while I pronounce it because you've got only two
                    more guesses
    And you only get one more hint:  there's an odd number of esses,
    And you only get ten more seconds no nine more seconds no eight
    And a right answer doesn't count if it comes in late
    And a wrong answer bumps you out of the losers' bracket
    And disqualifies you for the National Spellathon Contestant jacket
    And that's all the time extension you're going to gebt
    So go pick up your consolation prizes from the usherebt
    And don't be surprised if it's the bowdlerized regularized paperback
                    abridgment of Pepys
    Because around here, gentlemen, we play for kepys."

    Then I drive off in my chauffeured Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham
    Like something out of the last days of Fellini's Rougham
    And leave them smiting their brows and exclaiming to each other
                    "Ougham!
    O-U-G-H-A-M Ougham!" and tearing their hair.

    Intricate are the compoundments of despair.

    Well, brevity must be the soul of something-or-other.

    Not, certainly, of spelling, in the good old mother
    Tongue of Shakespeare, Raleigh, Marvell, and Vaughan.
    But something.  One finds out as one goes aughan.

Subj:   Can anyone help me with my most recent project?

I have just completed restoring two vintage radios.  One is an old
Atwater Kent table model with a hinged cover that exposes the panel.
I did a dumb thing by throwing the old tube-type superhetrodyne guts
away about 10 years ago; I replaced them with a transistor-type chassis.
The second project is the restoration of a Zenith console three-band
radio.  All restoration for both radios are completed and I now have
functional as well as good looking additions to the house.  The one
thing lacking is a set of five knobs for the Zenith.  Somewhere along
the line someone replaced the original knobs with some junk plastic
ones.  I don't know what the original knobs looked like.  I suppose
they may have been made from wood since the radio was probably made
in 1939 or so.  Do any Desperados know where I can get replacement
knobs or what the original knobs look like?

Thanks,

hello from Côte D'azur.

    this morning was just like any winter morning at *home* .. between 30Cm and
100Cm of snow and -10 degrees (C). they say this weather will last for another
couple of days .. i don't really mind it .. but i'm sure the nature here does.
once the snow melts this place will be filled with dead plants and animals. no
lemons this year, they say.

    nobody around here is prepared for this weather. as a matter of fact, the
locals here have only seen snow on TV, until now. perhaps this winter is to
match the great start of the summer last year? then we had hail ...

    the office is quite dead. i'm the only one from my group here. remote
diagnostics and hot-line got closed yesterday. some of the Lcg people came in
to the office on skiis this morning.

    i was down in Nice yesterday morning (about 45Min drive from the office).
the airport was closed. some people were SKIING on the sidewalks of Nice. for
you readers who live in NH, you know how a pine tree looks like when it is
overloaded with snow. could you imagine the pine tree to be replaced by a
palm? it is pretty .. but bizzare.

    i just heard they had -26 (C) in stockholm this morning .. some -50 (C) at
remote parts of finland, -40 (C) in switzerland.

               Digital kicks off $1.1 million contract with NFL

        The National Football League (NFL) has signed a $1.1 million
        contract with Digital to improve electronic communications
        between headquarters and the NFL's 28 member teams.  The League
        has purchased two VAX-11/780 computer systems with Digital's
        ALL-IN-1 integrated office and information system software

Brother Parmenter,

Remember when the sweet tides of sacred melody were washing about the mellow
shores of Desperado in October? Well, I thought that you and the brethren and
sistern might like to hear about the Nashua Hymn Festival, shortly to take
place and greatly to be enjoyed by those who, like yourself, loved
evening church.  On Sunday, February 10, at 7:30 p.m., First Church of Nashua
will host the choirs of several other churches in Nashua for a community hymn
sing. The first of what I do fervently hope will be an annual series was held
last year.

What happens is, the preacher delivers a very short history of a hymn, and how
it came to be written, and its place in the history of the church. Then
the congregation lets loose with this rouser in the four-part harmony,
with the massed choirs of Nashua soaring above and below. Then, while
the plaster settles, one of the choirs sings a hymn-based anthem. There
is a certain amount of competitive singing going on, with each choir trying
to outdo itself and all the other members of the robed Mafia. And so on into
the night!

Last year we sang such popular favorites as A Mighty Fortress and Our God
Our Help in Ages Past and several others, with emphasis on the Welsh heritage.
This year, I make no doubt, we will hit other hymnal high spots.

Those of you who joined in the Cokesbury/Southern Harmony correspondence
will have a wonderful time and those of you who wonder what on earth
we were getting so het up about should come too. I mean to say, tout
comprendre c'est tout pardonner!

First Church is located at the intersection of Amherst and Main Streets in
Nashua, up on Library Hill. It's the big, very lovely stone church with the
round stained glass windows. If you'd like further information, please send
me mail at ASGMKA::NEILSEN.

Rockers, rednecks, bluesers, popsters, jazzers:  Remember that this
stuff is *very* close to the roots of the kind of music you like.
And, let's not forget George Bernard Shaw's succinct summary of the
situation:  'Among the religious, I am an atheist, but among the
musical, I am the most religious of men.'  Kick out the jams!
