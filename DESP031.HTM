The best English language dictionary is most certainly the Merriam-
Webster Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged).

Now I know all you OED fans are going to disagree.  I'd probably think
more of the OED if it were available in a format that was as usable as
the Merriam-Webster.  The concise OED is a bit too concise, and twice
as expensive as the Collegiate version of the Merriam-Webster.

The word qoph is in the Merriam-Webster, as are qabbala, quabbalah,
(that last one is without a u, but it's difficult to change typing
habits), qadi, qazi, qantar, qasida, qat, qere, qeri, qibla, qiblah,
qinah, qintar, qiyas, and qoran.  The rest of the u-less q-words in
the M-W are either "usu cap" or "cap", and my breakoff on the Scrabble
acceptable words is after "oft cap" or "sometimes cap."

   "The Augustan period of poetry in Holland was even more blank and
dull than in the other countries of northern Europe.  Of the names
preserved in the history of literature there are but very few that
call for repetition here.  Arnold Hoogvliet (1687-1763) wrote a
passable poem in honour of the town of Vlaardingen, and a terrible
Biblical epic, in the manner of Blackmore, on the history of Abraham.
... Tragic drama was more or less capably represented by Lucretia
Wilhelmina van Merken (1722-1789), wife of the very dreary dramatist
Nicholaas Simon van Winter (1718-1795)"

For those of you interested in seeing The Dark Crystal:
        Be EXTREMELY cautious if you are in the Nashua area.  The Brandt Studio
2.5 is showing it here.  When it first opened they put it on screen 3.  That
screen seats 84 people [we counted while waiting for Dragonslayer to start]
and has a screen about a large as a good commuter van.  That is not the primary
problem.  The worst part is that #3 is carved out of #2.  They use the same
projection area to go to both screens.  The result is that #2 isn't too bad
a theatre if you don't mind an L-shaped theatre but #3's picture is sooo baaad
that you can easily notice that the credits tilt when they shouldn't.
For a good place, try the Revere Showcase 10 at the intersection of Rte.1 and
Rte.60.  The screen there does it some justice but I would like to find it in
Dolby Stereo.

I'm sorry that MENTOR::DVINCI::FISHER differs with me regarding my views
on the American Heritage Dictionary, and am amazed that he knew, since I
never expressed them publicly.  However, for the record, I will do so now.
(Screed alert! **** Screed Alert!  **** Screed Alert! ****)

I went to a very conservative school when I was a kid.  It was deep in
the heart of Boston, and taught us useful things for later life, like
the real past tense of snow (see Desperado back issues) and how to spell
colour properly.  Early on, I would guess the second or third grade, we
read a story that is supposed to tell the origin of the Webster's
American dictionary.

It seems friend Webster (I can never remember which one) as a child in
school was asked to spell "colour" and muffed it: he forgot the "U".  As
was the custom in those days, he was first verbally humiliated, and then
beaten by his teacher. (These days we don't hit kids.)  Webster called a
retaliatory strike: that evening, he held a mock spelling-bee, where he
took a chain saw to all the nasty Brittish spellings and made the sleek,
clean, easier (for him) to spell American spellings (mostly dropping the
u's from "-our" words and reversing the "re" at the end of things like
theatre and centre, it seems.)  In the tradition of New England
psycotics he held this prejudice firm until he was old enough to get
someone to print his dictionary, which in those nationalistic times was
a hit.

What has all this to do with the American Heritage Dictionary?  Well,
what we learn in our childhood, we carry through life.  I have never
been able to take a Webster's seriously.  All other American
dictionaries are just cheap copies of the Webster's.  Until the Taber's
is published, I use the Oxford Concise Dictionary of the English
Language for light reference and the OED for heavy hitting.  (OED story
-- A friend and I, slightly incapacitated by strong drink were going
through the OED one evening and ran across a word with the notation
"probably never used" in the etymology.  At the time, I was sure I would
remember the word, or at least the first letter, but it is all an
alcoholic blur now. *sigh*)

I think the plural of desperado should be desperada.  "Desperados" looks
like a breakfast food.  Wrong information (like who took the first slam
at the American Hermitage Dictionary) should be corrected in a desperrata,
which should never be confused with desperotos, which is where the merkin
madness might take us.

The correct English plural form of MOST words that end in "-o" is "-oes", as
with "potatoes", "tomatoes", and "zeroes" (contrary to popular opinion, which
has it "zeros").  However, DESPERADO is not a truly English-derived word, as
it is of Spanish origin.  The correct plural in Spanish is "-os", as in "ran-
cheros".  Therefore, and also because it takes less time to type, I propose a
standardization on "DESPERADOS".  Any objections?

Any Italian language student knows that the plural of a word ending in 'o'
ends in 'i' (with perhaps a couple of Greek-origin words I've forgotten).
Therefore, the plural of Desperado might be Desperadi (mightn't it?).

On parts of speech and sentence diagrams:

I do not beg to disagree (that parts of speech and sentence diagrams are
the underlying structure of the language)--I disagree violently.  I don't
know about parts of speech (I slept through those English classes), but
a sentence diagram is not part of the underlying structure of any language.
It is merely (and the emphasis is on the merely) someone's idea of a model
of the language.  Diagrams may be useful in learning the language, but to
think that they are the structure, rather than somebody's idea of how the
structure may be, is to not only miss the boat, but to get on one heading
the otehr way.  I had this same argument (about flowcharts and programs)
about six years ago, with a full professor of Electrical Engineering, who
thought that expertise in desigining analog amplifiers carried over into
designing compilers in Fortran.  I surrendered on that argument because
I didn't have the time (carrying five other courses) to fight it out.

Digit, as a term for Digital employees, was in fashion as far back as
1973, when I was graduating from high school.  The Westminster plant
had been open for a year or two, and some of my acquaintances who went
to work there promptly became known as digits.  (I know some people who
work at Prime and call themselves Primates.)

About Dark Crystal and the Harvard Square Cinema:  The movie is the same
as every recent fantasy flick I've seen:  boring.  The stories are all
identical (and so are the lines!).  However, the film is worth seeing
for the effects.  However they are at writing scripts, Henson and
company are masters of their art:  puppeteering.  Dark Crystal is worth
seeing twice, in fact; as soon as I get another chance, I will happily
go back to see the marvelous creatures invented by Henson's crew.

Strange perversions of language can be excused if they are made with the in-
tent to communicate more nearly perfectly; what CANNOT be tolerated are lazy
and uncaring errors, e.g., the use of "rectangle" when what is meant is "ob-
long", or the following, quoted from a magazine ad:

"The FPS-164 attaches to VAX (TM), IBM and Univac systems, offloads and pro-
cesses computationally-intensive tasks,  leaving the host computer free  for
other work."

The latter error could have been expressed correctly in at least three ways,
but, as it stands, it is senseless gibberish, not even a complete  sentence.
Are we to permit language to descend to the level of grunts and groans mere-
ly because the vast majority of humankind will not bother to use it correct-
ly?   I say NAY!  Such a course is akin to using dime-store wrenches and ex-
pecting them to work and last like Snap-On or Craftsman tools.   But I agree
that diagrams are only tools whereby we attempt to understand language.

The Desperado debate on the merits of one dictionary versus another amused me.
Among librarians, who wouldn't dream of limiting themselves to one
definitive source, dictionary debates are very serious business -- sometimes
taken to paranoid extremes:

"Dictionaries should be purchased cautiously.  Because they are expensive
undertakings, unscrupulous publishers sometimes employ incompetent editors
or insufficient help or offer a reprint of an old work with little or no
revision.  Furthermore, devious means are employed to hide such practices."
  (Constance Winchell, GUIDE TO REFERENCE BOOKS, 8th ed.)

Never, never, buy any old Webster's dictionary.  "Webster's" is no longer a
copyrighted trademark.  Buy a dictionary published by the Merriam Webster
Company in Springfield, Mass., if you want THE REAL THING.

And you should --  WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY, UNABRIDGED
is considered the classic DEscriptive dictionary, and joins the 11th edition
of the Britannica in reference book heaven.  Its heft is also useful in getting
things to lie flat.

One Desperado's avoidance of the use of the word "adjective" reminded
me that in German, there are words for the parts of speech that are
composed of other words in the language that are in common use.

For example, adjective is Eigenschaftswort (characteristic word).
Pronoun is Fuerwort (for word).
Noun is Hauptwort (main word).
Verb is Zeitwort (time word).
Preposition is Verhaeltniswort (relationship word).

However, grammar textbooks usually use words of Latin origin (probably
because it sounds more learned).  Adjektiv, Pronomen, Substantiv, Verb,
and Praeposition, respectively.

How the world sees us -- quoted without comment:

        Despite the fact that Digital Equipment Corp.'s ambitious new
        networking plan is being implemented on its DECsystem-10 and
        DECsystem-20 mainframe lines, product development activity within
        its Large Computer Group appears to have slowed.  Evidence of that
        trend surfaced at a recent meeting of DECUS, the DEC user group,
        where word was quitely passed that the new DECsystem-20 model, which
        was expected early next year, was delayed by as much as a year.
        Taking up the slack at the high end will be a new VAX-11 entry that
        sources refer to as a "monster VAX."  The 32-bit product, scheduled
        for introduction late in the first quarter, likely will be designated
        the VAX-11/790 and will provide virtually the same performance
        features as the company's 36-bit mainframes.  No word yet on pricing.

                                        . . .

        Also surfacing at DECUS was word that DEC will be coming out with a
        new version of its RSX-11M operating system by April.  The new release
        is expected to provide major enhancements over the current version,
        but observers say the product's significance lies in the fact that DEC
        is actively continuing to support its PDP-11 line, which some feel is
        being caught in a squeeze between DEC's personal computer entries and
        its VAX products.
                                        . . .

        Having recently experienced its first earnings plunge in seven years,
        Digital Equipment Corp. reportedly has decided to batten down the
        hatches against worsening economic tides.  Internal sources say DEC
        is looking to reduce its work force by 20 percent worldwide by the
        end of 1985.  Since the employee roster now stands at 67,000, such a
        reduction would be difficult to accomplish strictly through attrition
        -- a long-standing DEC policy.  The proposed cutback would practically
        equal the whole shop at some other Fortune 500 companies.  Data Gene-
        ral Corp., for instance, has a total of 15,000 employees - only 1500
        more than DEC plans to cut.
