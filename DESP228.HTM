        This is the special Christmas issue.  It better be good.  Some of
        these things have been hanging around for two Christmases waiting
        to get in here.

        This first is from a regular contributor who left his name off
        this so he could put his heart and soul into it.

Subj:   Desperado means "hopeless" doesn't it?

Brother John was a drunk who spent the end of his life living with mom and pop
after his wife finally threw him out. I spent a few of those last dreary
Christmases and New Years with just him and the old man, in their little house
by the dead winter sea in Nahant. The mum escaped to Chicago for Christmas, for
her idyllic grandma-type respite with daughter and three grandchildren.

Papa and I held the fort. Tried to prevent the sleeping-while-smoking maniac
from burning the house down and maybe if lucky keep ourselves and even him
alive during the godless, deathly Yuletide season. The year before I gave them
a rare Christmas present, His and Her fire extinguishers, one for the kitchen
and one for upstairs.

Grey sky, grey ocean, grey gulls, grey everything. Horrible bitter wind. Ocean
crashing against the sea wall. Alone. The hell with Christmas anyhow. Himself
in his room till 3 pm on Christmas day, till the old man goes up and bangs on
the door - 'Go down and eat somethin for chrissakes.' As it were. Emerging an
hour later, down to the kitchen, inhales a can of Hearty Man soup cold right
out of the can and stumbles back upstairs. Leaving the can and spoon in it on
the counter goddam slob.

Merry Christmas to you too, brother John.

We go to pa's club (Division 11, Ancient Order of Hibernians - the AOs to us)
for a bit of sober drinking with the other refugees. To get away from the
drunk.

Next day he takes off on the old man's black 3-speed Raleigh. To the packy down
the street. In brown polyester sport jacket, no socks. In a snowstorm.
Wobbling up the street in the greyness and snow, holding his jacket tight
around his neck with one hand. To get a drink. Caldwell's Vodka, if they have
it. Ah Caldwell's Vodka a wonderful year.

Nothing on TV but perfect fairy tale families where everybody's rosy-cheeked
and warm and saintly and loving. Making everybody who doesn't have perfect TV
families feel like perfect failures. And the bloody smarmy christians get to
act sanctimonious at you.

I want to see my boys, he thought. All I want is an idyllic family of my own,
he thought. Too late stupid. You had your chance. Your family is destroyed,
and you did it. Unable to confront the ludicrousness of his wish, he took to
the drink with a sullen and relentless self-destructive rage. Every year at
this time, blown in on the winter wind.

Came back one year on Christmas morning. Old man drove to charming Central
Square in Lynn in his dark green Volvo 1800S to pick me up. So cold there
weren't any drunks in Central Square, at least not live ones. Record cold
(1982 or so), zero and windy. Drove back across the causeway to help out with
Himself. Windshield wipers didn't work (nothing worked - the car was a
classic). Sat so low you peered out the front, like a little tank in the snow.

Finally drinks himself to death, aged 39. Couldn't make it through a winter on
his own. Ma has to give St. Pius's rectory $100 to get their juniorest priest
to come out and say a few words over the grave at St. Joe's. They'd rather do a
whole funeral mass. More money in it. Five of us in that godless winter wind.
Six including my horizontal brother. In the spring the VA installs his bronze
plaque, but on the wrong plot. Ma doesn't complain because it's only 40 feet
away and anyway it's a fitting epitaph.

Next winter drunken cancer-ridden father slides into a guardrail driving home
from AOs. Jaw broken and seven teeth lost. Visit him in Salem hospital, this is
it we think. Prowling priest sees an Irish name on the bed, strolls over and
hello John are you a Catholic he patronizes. Offers the service of extreme
unction, the sacrament for the nearly departed. But pa is not interested, him
and me both in instant resentment of this stranger with the cheek to be calling
my father by his first name as if they were old pals, just because he wears the
collar. And through jaw wired shut responds that he is a Druid, not a Catholic.
He is not interested in unction of any type, extreme or otherwise. Holy Ghost
in the form of a vulture circling the intensive care unit searching for lost
souls, but it wasn't going to get him. Indeed he recovered like a champ, and
survived another year.

Finally buried him at the Bourne VA cemetary. The Jesuit on call there a BC
alumnus like father and Uncle Ed. Uncle Ed who while waiting for the lost
hearse (some last joke done by dead pa) recalls names this priest might
remember, from the graduating classes of the thirties. Name after name he
brings forth, names by the dozen, but in vain alas. Jesuit is not the sharpest
of the lot, concludes Uncle Ed under his breath. Hearse finally shows up an
hour late, careening round the last turn and landing on the grass. Grieved
mother suspects driver stopped somewhere for a quick one, possessed by the
spirit of father not quite at rest till a final rendezvous with his more
familiar spirits. His funeral did better. They played taps, birds sang, and
nobody made a profit on his soul.

Subj:   Urban Myth Cookies

Hello All,

   A little bit of "urban myth" email came my way recently about an
$250 cookie recipe at Neiman_Marcus.  The story is bogus, but the recipe
that was included with the story made WONDERFUL cookies :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)
[FIVE SMILES].

   For your holiday dining pleasure here is the recipe:

Bob

----------------------------------------------------------
The "Urban Myth" Cookie Recipe
----------------------------------------------------------
 2 cups butter                1 tsp. salt
 2 cups sugar                 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 cups brown sugar           2 tsp. baking soda
 4 eggs                       24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 tsp. vanilla               1-8 oz. Hershey bar, grated
 4 cups flour                 3 cups chopped nuts
 5 cups oatmeal (powdered)

1) Cream butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla.
2) Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
3) Mix flour, salt, baking powder, oatmeal and baking soda
   in a separate bowl..
4) Mix everything from steps 1,2 and three together.
5) Add chocolate chips, Hershey bar flakes and nuts.
6) Roll into balls and place on a cookie sheet.
7) Bake for 10 minutes at 375.

Makes 112 cookies (recipe may be halved).

The recipe leaves a little wiggle room so here are the
additional assumptions I made:

  Recipe             What I used
-----------------------------------------------------
 Butter              Land-o-Lakes butter w/salt
 Brown Sugar         Domino's Light Brown Sugar
 Eggs                Large eggs
 Chopped Nuts        Planters Lightly Salted Cashews

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        This is so deconstructionistically brilliant I can't hardly stand
        it.  Not only does Big Bob drop the story -- known to scholars as
        the Waldorf Cake Legend -- he also replaces the mundane
        ingredients with suspiciously specific ingredients in the best
        folk recipe style.  My only complaint is that instead of
        replacing "eggs" with "large eggs" he should have gone all the
        way to "jumbo brown eggs".

Subj:   meltdown on your own Xmas tree

So I found a good failure mode for Christmas tree lights - runaway
overvoltage leading to total destruction.

I have an old string that I use for a wreath.  I've had it for years,
and one by one the bulbs have failed.  The bulbs on these small strings
are all in series instead of in parallel.  They do that so that each
bulb only sees a couple of volts, and can therefore be cheaper and
smaller.

The trouble is that if a bulb burns out, it would cut off current to
everything else, and the whole string would fail.  To prevent that,
they put a little fail-safe in each bulb that shorts it out when the
bulb fails.  That way the current will still go through the bad one.

So as each bulb fails and shorts out, the line voltage is distributed
across the fewer and fewer remaining bulbs.  The voltage goes up just
a little bit, causing the next one to fail that much faster, which
then increases the voltage, which makes the next one fail, until
WHOOMPF! they all go at once.

But damn!  I missed it!  When I got home all I found was a dead wreath
and a lot of bulbs with nice little metal coatings of vaporized
tungsten on the inside. Better that than a burned-down house, I
suppose.

           'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS' - "REBECCAstyle"
            -------------------------------     ------------

T'was the night before Christmas, and all through the shop,
The computers were whirring; they never do stop.
The power was on and the temperature right,
In hopes that the input would feed back that night.
The system was ready, the program was coded
The memory drums had been carefully loaded;
While adding a christmasy glow to the scene,
The lights in the console flashed red, white and green.
When out in the hall there arose such a clatter,
As Rebecca ran to see what's the matter.
Away to the hallway she flew like a flash.
Forgetting her keycard in that curious dash.
She stood in the hallway and looked all about,
When the door slammed behind her and she was locked out.
Then, in the computer room what should appear,
But a minature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer;
And a little old man, who with scarcely a pause,
Chuckled: "my name is Santa ... the last name is Claus."

The computer was startled, confused by the name,
Then whirled as it heard the old fellow exclaim:
"This is Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen,
And Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen."
With all these odd names, it was puzzled anew;
It hummed and it clanked, and a main circuit blew.
It searched through its memory, trying to "think";
Then the multi-line printer went on the blink.

Unable to do its electronic job,
It said in a voice that was almost a sob:
"Your eyes - how they twinkle - your dimples so merry,
Your cheeks so like roses, your nose like a cherry.
All these things, I've been programmed to know,
And at data-recall, I'm more than so-so;
But your name and your address (computers can't lie),
Are things that I can't identify.
You've a jolly old face and a little round belly
That shakes when you laugh like a bowlful of jelly;
My scanners can see you, but still I insist,
Since you're not in my program, you cannot exist!"

Old Santa just chuckled a merry "Ho, ho,"
And sat down to type out a quick word or so.
The keyboard clack-clattered, its sound sharp and clean,
As Santa fed "data" into the machine:
"Kids everywhere know me; I come every year;
The presents I bring add to everyone's cheer;
But you'll receive nothing - that's plain to see;
Too bad that your mentors forgot about me."
Then he faced the machine and said with a shrug,
"Merry Christmas to all" as he pulled out its plug.

Subj:   enlightenment through unix

Unix teaches us about the tranistory nature of all things, thus
ridding us of samsaric attachments and hastening enlightenment.  For
instance, while trying to make sense of an X initialization script
someone had given me, I came across a line that looked like an
ordinary unix shell command with the term "exec" prefaced to it.
Curious as to what exec might do, I typed "exec ls" to a shell window.
It listed a directory, then proceeded to kill the shell and every
other window I had, leaving the screen almost totally black with a
tiny white inactive cursor hanging at the bottom to remind me that
nothing is absolute and all things partake of their opposite.

In the past I might have gotten upset or angry at such an occurance.
That was before I found enlightenment through Unix.  Now, I no longer
have attachments to my processes.  Both processes and the disapperance
of processes are illusory.  The world is unix, unix is the world,
labor ceaslessly for the salvation of all sentient beings.

Subj:   Socialism the free enterprise way

TIME AGAIN FOR THE UNTIED WAY

Socialism the free enterprise way: An experiment in charitable impulses

By Jon Carroll
[Snarfed without permission from the SF Chron]

'Tis the season to be jolly, fa la la la la and hold the phone!  Oh, my,
yes.  'Tis certainly the season to be bustling and rustling and
generally caught up in the spirit of something.

The spirit of enduring your relatives, perhaps.  The spirit of becoming
vaguely nauseated inside of department stores.  The spirit of trying to
stop the musical phrase "a-rum-pa-ta-tum" from metastasizing in your
brain and destroying the cells you use for purchasing decisions.

And 'tis traditionally the season for remembering those less fortunate
than ourselves.  They are always with us, those those.  The gap widens,
so that those who really are in pretty dreadful shape are more numerous
in this country than before, and more visible.

Sometimes it feels as though there's a third world country inside this
first world country, does it not?

And the question, in this season particularly, is what gesture does one
make?  It will only be a gesture in the grand scale; on the individual
scale, it will be quite real and immediate and benign.  There are many
possibilities, many ways of approaching the situation.  I suggest the
Untied Way.

The Untied way has several immediate advantages.  For one thing, as a
disorganized charity, it has no overhead at all.  One hundred percent of
your funds will reach the needy. Also, because it requires you to
actually move among the recipients of your donation, it gives you an
emotional appreciation of the situation.

Writing a check is very pleasant and commendable; walking the sidewalks
on a cold December afternoon is perhaps more instructive.

Here's how it works.  On a day of your choosing, go to your ATM machine
and take out a significantly large sum of money; that is, a sum that
will make a small but perceptible dent in your cash flow.  That will
provide you with a bundle of crisp $20 bills.

Then begin to walk the streets.  Market Street is a good one; there are
others.  When someone asks you for money, give him or her a $20.
Usually, you will get a surprised double take and a thank you.
Occasionally, you will be called a "radio Communist" or something
equally odd.

Doesn't matter.  A human being will spent the $20 in a way that will
comfort the human being.  Your gratification is not the point of the
exercise; this is charity, not a testimonial dinner.

There are crazy people out there; this is true.  There are people who
fall through the cracks; heck, there are people who push themselves
through the cracks and lie hidden under the floorboards.  Perhaps you
will be lucky enough to encounter one of them as an Untied Way
volunteer.

Sometimes your money is spent in ways that seem foolish or
incomprehensible.  Sometimes a malnourished person will buy a new hat.
That decision is outside the purview of the Untied Way.  Each person's
priorities are his own, and heads get cold.

And sometimes the money will be spent on drugs or booze.  That may be
regrettable, but it is true regardless.  Many more fortunate people take
drugs when they are sick or depressed; it would be cruel to deny the
same solace to those unable to find cooperative physicians.

Keep walking until you run out of $20 bulls.  It doesn't take that long,
and you'll have gotten in a bracing stroll.  Also, you will have
redistributed some income.  The trickle-down theory works only if you're
willing to spread your fingers.

Subj:   Input for Christmas Desperado ...

Tom,

Not sure if you have this as part of your vast array of important things
and illustrious information.

It applies to any denomination or creed ... sort of nifty stuff ....

In my family we have an adjunct expression:

                "When some one does you a kindness,
                 don't return it ...

                 pass it on ..."

Regards,

Christopher

                              PRACTICE
                          RANDOM KINDNESS
                                AND
                     SENSELESS ACTS OF BEAUTY

It's a crisp winter day in San Francisco. A woman in a red Honda, Christ-
mas presents piled in the back, drives up to the Bay Bridge tollbooth.
"I'm paying for myself, and for the six cars behind me," she says with a
smile, handing over seven commuter tickets.

One after another, the next six drivers arrive at the tollbooth, dollars
in hand, only to be told, "Some lady up ahead already paid your fare.
Have a nice day."

The woman in the Honda, it turned out, had read something on an index
card taped to a friend's refrigerator: "Practice random kindness and
senseless acts of beauty." The phrase seemed to leap out at her, and she
copied it down.

Judy Foreman spotted the same phrase spray-painted on a warehouse wall a
hundred miles from her home. When it stayed on her mind for days, she
gave up and drove all the way back to copy it down. "I thought it was
incredibly beautiful," she said explaining why she's taken to writing it
at the bottom of all her letters, "like a message from above."

Her husband, Frank, liked the phrase so much that he put it up on the
wall for his seventh graders, one of whom was the daughter of a local
columnist. The columnist put it in the paper, admitting that though she
liked it, she didn't know where it came from [sic] or what it really
meant.

Two days later, she heard from Anne Herbert. Tall, blonde, and forty,
Herbert lives in Marin, one of the country's ten richest counties, where
she house-sits, takes odd-jobs, and gets by. It was in a Sausalito
restaurant that Herbert jotted the phrase down on a paper place mat,
after turning it around in her mind for days.

"That's wonderful!" a man sitting nearby said, and copied it down
carefully on his own placemat.

"Here's the idea," Herbert says. "anything you think there should be
more of, do it randomly."

Her own fantasies include: (1) breaking into depressing-looking schools
to paint the classrooms, (2) leaving hot meals on kitchen tables in the
poor parts of town, (3) slipping money into a proud old woman's purse.
Says Herbert, "kindness can build on itself as much as violence can."
Now the phrase is spreading, on bumper stickers, on walls, at the bottom
of letters and business cards. And as it spreads, so does a vision of
guerrilla goodness.

In Portland, Oregon, a man might plunk a coin into a stranger's meter
just in time. In Patterson, New Jersey, a dozen people with pails and
mops and tulip bulbs might descend on a run-down house and clean it from
top to bottom while the frail elderly owners look on, dazed and smiling.
In Chicago, a teenage boy may be shoveling off the driveway when the
impulse strikes. What the hell, nobody's looking, he thinks, and shovels
the neighbor's driveway, too.

It's positive anarchy, disorder, a sweet disturbance. A woman in Boston
writes "Merry Christmas!" to the tellers on the back of her checks. A
man in St. Louis, whose car has just been rear-ended by a young woman,
waves her away, saying, "It's a scratch. Don't Worry."

Senseless acts of beauty spread: A man plants daffodils along the
roadway, his shirt billowing in the breeze from passing cars. In
Seattle, a man appoints himself a one man vigilante sanitation service
and roams the concrete hills collecting litter in a supermarket cart. In
Atlanta, a man scrubs graffiti from a green park bench.

They say you can't smile without cheering yourself up a little --
likewise, you can't commit a random act of kindness without feeling as
if your own troubles have been lightened if only because the world has
become a slightly better place.

And you can't be a recipient without feeling a shock, a pleasant jolt.
If you were one of those rush-hour drivers who found your bridge fare
paid, who knows what you might have been inspired to do for someone else
later? Wave someone on in the intersection? Smile at a tired clerk? Or
something larger, greater? Like all revolutions, guerrilla goodness
begins slowly, with a single act. Let it be yours.

&gt;From time to time, someone writing about language mentions that Eskimoes
have some number of words for snow.  However, the list of words is never
given.

Couple of weeks ago, someone named D.K. Holm in the Boston Phoenix came up
with the list, drawn from the Inupiat Eskimo Dictionary by Webster and
Zibell, and from Thibert's English-Eskimo Eskimo-English Dictionary.

The words may remind you of generated passwords.

Subj:   Leap seconds

In article &lt;869@Snoopy.Logicon.COM&gt;, Makey@Snoopy.Logicon.COM (Jeff

|&gt; Last year I reported that Pacific Bell had inserted the leap second in
|&gt; their dial-up "at the tone" voice number at some point between about
|&gt; 23:55 and 00:25 GMT, but I hadn't followed more closely.  This year, I
|&gt; paid much closer attention, and the leap second was inserted a couple
|&gt; of minutes late.  The gory details follow.
|&gt;
|&gt; For the record, the number I called is 853-1212 in the 619 area code.
|&gt; I am in the city of San Diego, California, which is in the United
|&gt; States Pacific Time Zone.  Standard time is in effect here at this
|&gt; time of year, so the local time at midnight GMT is 4 PM.
|&gt;
|&gt; A couple of minutes before midnight GMT I called and set my digital
|&gt; quartz watch as precisely as possible to the indicated time.  The
|&gt; voice is a woman's, and every ten seconds she says something like
|&gt; "Good afternoon.  At the tone, Pacific Standard Time will be three
|&gt; fifty-eight and twenty seconds."  This is followed by a pure tone of
|&gt; approximately 1/2 second in length.
|&gt;
|&gt; If the leap second had been inserted properly, there would have been
|&gt; an interval of 11 seconds between 23:59:50 and 00:00:00 GMT.  Instead,
|&gt; the usual 10-second interval was observed, which means that the tone
|&gt; was heard at GMT 23:59:50, 23:59:60, 00:00:09, 00:00:19, etc.  This
|&gt; continued for 3 minutes, when tones were heard at GMT 00:02:49,
|&gt; 00:02:59, and 00:03:00.  There was considerable confusion for the next
|&gt; 2 minutes, with the synthesized voice not saying all the words and/or
|&gt; saying them in the wrong place.  The tones were heard sporadically,
|&gt; often one second late.  Finally, a tone was heard at 00:05:00 GMT and
|&gt; everything returned to normal, with the correct time (including leap
|&gt; second) being given from then on.
|&gt;
|&gt; I hope the NTP chimers fared much better than this.  If you want me to

Subj:   How to cook your own goose (for Christmas dinner)

Dawn Banks is, in addition to a brilliant software engineer, a very funny
person in terms of telling stories on herself.  Here's Dawn's story of how
she cooked her own goose for Christmas.

As Tom Parmenter might say, forward with daring and whimsy (or something
like that).

Tom

                         -&lt; Ok, so I did it myself... &gt;-

                                 by Dawn Banks

     With the thermometer reading 50 degrees on the 22nd, and with
visions of Charles Dickens and Mr McGoo swimming in my head, I decided
that this would be the year that I finally have my Christmas goose.
This decision nearly cost me a long stating relationship with perhaps
the only person in the universe who would actually live with me and
enjoy it, but such is the price of dreams fulfilled.

     See, my sweetheart doesn't really like fowl that much.  Well, he
likes chicken a lot, and it takes almost nothing to talk him into
ordering a duck in a restaurant, but there's just something about
roasting a large fowl at home that really puts him off.  The "something"
is that he can't stand it.

     The smell of roasting turkey is the worst for him, which makes him
an absolute delight come Thanksgiving day.  He tolerates the scoops of
starch slop that go along with such a dinner, but he only tolerates it
because he can't think of any place better to stay.

     The other problem he has with eating big home-roasted birds is my
cooking technique, which somehow manages to evenly distribute bits of
dinner all over the kitchen (and parts of the living and dining rooms)
during the hours preceding dinner.  Lest he think "Well, it makes her
happy", he also gets to watch me drop the bird on the floor, find out
that pies ALWAYS land face down, invent whole new prefixes to express
the unprecedented number of lumps in my gravy (which he hates even more
than the bird), cuss a lot, cry a lot, and cut at least half my hair off
with the electric knife.

     So, it was with the same look of confused concern that he used back
when I was going to give myself a lIposuction job, that he finally gave
in and let me cook my goose this Christmas.  The only condition was that
I allow him to cover all the kitchen surfaces in plastic first.

     Actually, we made a feeble attempt at first to find a restaurant
that served Christmas goose.  Feeble because we actually found a place
(or were told of it before we even started to look), but failed to make
reservations because I didn't know if it was worth driving to the next
state for.  Anyway, I enjoy cooking, or so I seem to think.

     Cooking one's goose is an interesting experience, to say the least.
The first thing you should do in preparing a goose is to take pictures
of your kitchen before you start.  This isn't absolutely necessary, but
it is nice proof that so much damage could be done in a few short hours.
Cooking a goose has an even more profound effect on your kitchen than
Tang has on your dishwasher, although it isn't nearly as positive as
Tang.

     As it turns out, I learned quite a bit about geese that I didn't
know before.  Here's one thing about geese: They're water fowl.  Doesn't
mean anything to you? Well try this one: I seriously doubt that geese
have found Jane Fonda yet.  I mean, I thought *I* was fat, but I hadn't
seen anything yet.

     Another thing is that geese are approximately the most ornery
critters on the face of this planet.  Sure, a shark will eat you without
so much as a "by your leave", and a cat will devour everything you hold
dear, but a goose is just downright nasty.  Try walking up to introduce
yourself to one sometime, and you'll see what I mean.  The only reason
geese aren't more popular than watchdogs is that a watch-goose would
just as happily kill its owner, as well as any intruder.

     I guess I knew that much already, but what I didn't know is that
they're just as ornery in death as they are in life.  They're hard to
find in the supermarket, they have just tons of gookie stuff inside that
you have to clean out before roasting, they feel even more disgusting
than raw chicken, and they'll hiss and spit at you the whole time you're
roasting them.

     This is the part I didn't know: Roasting a goose is almost exactly
like roasting a 12 pound slab of bacon, only the bacon would be less
messy.

     In a nutshell, take a 12 pound goose, stick it in the oven, and
when all's said and done, you'll have five pounds of cooked goose and
seventeen pounds of goose grease.  I have no idea how this can happen,
but I was there, and it happened.  Another thing that happened was that
we found about four sets of directions of how to cook a goose, and none
of them seemed to match.

     You'd think that you'd just stick it in a roasting pan and cook it
like a turkey, but you'd be wrong.  Of course, you could try, and you'd
probably end up with a lot smaller mess, but this is clearly not in
keeping with what appears to be a tradition of lubricating your entire
kitchen on Christmas day.  It would seem that the directions for cooking
the goose are ritualistic to some point; a sort of penance that does
almost as much harm to the chef as to the goose.

     In the end, we took the steps that all the different directions
seemed to agree on, and were met with about as much success as you'd
expect in such a venture.  I'm just recounting them here from memory,
although I still have some strong memories, so I think it'll be
accurate:

Step 1: Thaw the goose.  This is the easy part.  It converts what used
to be an oblong brick in a plastic bag into a soft, mushy, disgusting
feeling salmonella culture in a plastic bag.  Yes, you will have to
remove it from the plastic bag, which will probably require about as
much courage as you can muster.

Step 2: Remove the excess fat from the body cavity.  Don't take this too
seriously, else you might not have any goose left afterward.  The excess
fat in the body cavity will probably constitute about 1/5 of the bird by
weight.

Step 3: If it's a wild goose, oil the skin.  If it isn't, you've got to
be kidding.  As a matter of fact, I can't imagine why you'd want to oil
the skin on even a wild goose.  Maybe by "wild", they didn't mean the
origins of the goose itself, but rather the experience you're planning
on having.

Step 4: Stuff the bird.  Might as well make the stuffing dry, because
there'll be no end of moisture for it to soak up later on.  You'll also
probably notice that there's room for more stuffing inside the bird than
there is meat on the bird.  My sweetie takes this to be a good sign.

Step 5: Put the bird in a shallow roasting pan.  Nothing ever really
said why it should be shallow, and not just a regular deep roasting pan
like one I always use to roast turkey.  As a matter of fact, I've heard
of people doing quite well with a deep roasting pan.  I think the reason
that you don't want to use a deep one is that if you're lax about
following steps 7-18, you'll end up deep frying the bird in its own fat.
With a shallow pan, it'll just run over the sides.

Step 6: Put the bird in a 400 degree oven, breast side up, for an hour.

Steps 7-18: Stop by every five minutes to siphon off the quart of grease
that's materialized since you last saw the bird.  Wear dark glasses when
you do this, because when you open the oven door, it'll be hissing and
spitting bad enough already, and if it recognizes you, it'll get even
worse.  No, the dark glasses won't just disguise you.  They'll also keep
you from getting grease spit in your eye.

Not even death can diminish the crabbiness of a goose.

Oh yes: Also part of these steps is to continually reset the smoke
alarm.  All that fat shooting off the goose that manages to miss you is
going to fall right square on the oven's heating elements, and generate
almost as much smoke.

Step 19: Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and turn the bird over.  The
only fathomable reason for turning the bird is that by now it'll be
stuck to the bottom of the pan, and trying to turn it will distribute
goose fat over all exposed kitchen surfaces when the thing comes
unstuck.  Anyway, the spirit of the soon departed goose will be amused
at watching you and your soon to be ex-spouse gingerly trying to wrestle
a hissing, spitting, slimey disgustingly greasy bird carcass loose from
the bottom of the roasting pan.

Steps 20-43: Stop by every five minutes for the next two hours to siphon
off the rest of the grease.  It should be pretty well dead by now,
meaning that you can put away (throw away) the dark glasses.  It won't
be spitting grease anymore.  It'll just be gushing out the sides.

Step 44: Answer the doorbell and explain to the EPA agent what you're
doing to the sewer system, why you're doing it, and how it relates to
Christmas and the holiday spirit.

Step 45: When the greaseball reaches an internal temperature of 195
degrees, remove from the oven, shower, and frantically prepare all the
side dishes.

Step 46: After the bird has cooled for 15 minutes, gingerly pierce the
skin with a fork, and try to catch the bird as it flies around the
kitchen explosively disposing of hot grease under pressure.

Step 47: Attempt to carve the bird, marveling at how it can have a
completely unexpected and illogical bone structure.  Don't worry about
where on the bird the meat comes from, because it's all dark meat: A
rich dark brown.  Keep a firm grip on the knife as it slides around on
all the greasy parts (which is anything in the kitchen, at this point).

Step 48: Sit down to some of the most wonderful tasting poultry you're
ever liable to sink teeth into.  This stuff is to die for.

     It's one of the most wonderful things I've ever eaten.
Furthermore, the stuffing took on some goose flavoring, too, so it
tasted wonderful as well.

     My dearest said: "Well, it's sort of like turkey dark meat."
Roughly translated into English, this means "This really s*cks and I
hope it's at least another decade before I have to endure this again."

     Oh yes, I almost forgot:

Step 49: Rush down to the emergency room and get those 2nd and 3rd
degree burns all over your face looked at.  On second thought, don't.
The doctor will just laugh his *ss off, mutter something about "goose
measles", and insist on taking your cholesterol level.  No, he isn't
worried about your health.  He and the other doctors have a pool going
to see who can find the person with the highest cholesterol count.  One
look at you, and he knows that he's going home a rich man.

     Well, *I* thought it was wonderful, and as soon as we've worked out
the divorce settlement, I think I'll try doing it again.

                 Praises to the Lord for the life of Merrill Greenlee

A good friend and brother in the Lord died last Thursday at the age of 59
from cancer.  I just want to share with you all his last words to those
of us left behind as he entered the New Kingdom.  He was in the last
throes, and very weak, just waiting to leave.  His wife and sister were
at his bedside, when he began  to speak to someone they could not see.
Both his wife and sister described it  as being like listening to someone
talk on the telephone, when you can only hear one half of what is clearly
a conversation.  They couldn't catch everything he  said, but they did
hear him say the following:

"Oh, Jesus," as he made a knocking motion with his hand.

"Hurry up"

"Wow!"

"Hi Grandma"

He then began responding as if he were answering questions, turning his
head from side to side with each answer as if he were talking to more
than one  person:

"Yes"

"Yes"

"No"

"Yes"

"Grandma Greenlee, when I was young"

He then looked at his wife, and said "You're beautiful."

He looked over at pictures of his four Grandchildren, and waving with one
hand he said "Goodbye" to each of them by name.

Then he peacefully stopped breathing.

Praise the Lord that our brother is now living in Peace and Joy in the
New Kingdom.

        Well, we started this out with a downer, so I thought we could
        end with an upper.  Beyond the rancid radio ravings of Oral
        Roberts and Herbert W. Armstrong (not to mention Garner Ted
        Armstrong). forgetting Jim and Tammy and the mascara jokes, Jimmy
        Lee Swaggart and his apparently uncontrollable, and rather rank,
        desires, and Billy Graham and his gigantic suits and gigantic
        rallies and his plummy, precise pompous way of talking, beyond
        the religious wars of the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th,
        15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, to name but a
        few, and beyond all the social-class prejudice of the thinking
        classes ("the thinking classes, they think they think"), there is
        a genuine Christian religion humming along in the background of
        the western world (and many places in the eastern as well),
        perhaps not so prominent now as in other years, but far, far from
        gone away, affecting the daily behavior and attitudes of millions
        of souls (not all of them "simple") and probably having had, over
        the past 1991 years (big anniversary coming up) a net positive
        effect.

        Now the thing about civilization is that it consists of
        potentials, most of them unrealized.  As the need develops,
        civilization coughs up the personnel to do the job.  Millions who
        once would have occupied their time entirely on brain-teasers and
        bridge are now gainfully employed as computer programmers.  As
        soon as we solve programming, these folks can return to their
        innocent pastimes.  Just so, the Christians, out there, quietly
        living their lives, ignored by the New York Times and NBC,
        scorned by the liberals, patronized by the conservatives, wait
        for the time when the call goes out for them and they will
        reappear in force.  In no time, two or three years at the most,
        Time and Newsweek will run cover stories on the Christian
        Renaissance.

        Point of personal privilege:  I don't belong to a church or go to
        a church and I didn't send my children to one either, but I was
        raised a Southern Methodist and a fair amount of it stuck.

                                    =*=

        And, what about the commercialism of Christmas?  I certainly hope
        everyone will be committing random acts of kindness and/or
        passing out $20 bills willy nilly this time of year, but I don't
        think you should be too depressed about the big-money side of
        Christmas.  The wise men saw nothing wrong with gifts, even
        ridiculously expensive ones, although I don't believe it's been
        recorded what happened to the gifts.  Perhaps the gold,
        frankincense and myrrh all went for household expenses and
        education.  At any rate, Christmas is the time we loosen the
        pursestrings a bit, not usually because we have some heavy
        negative obligation, but because we want an excuse to do nice
        things for each other, and because certain major expenditures
        have been put off.  These are things that are like luxuries, but
        luxuries you need, new towels. new tablecloths, new sweaters,
        yes, ties (for those who wear 'em), small appliances (the butter
        shooter is dopey and the salad shooter is only semi-plausible, but
        if we all chipped in to buy my brother a CD player and then
        everyone also bought him CDs, is that a terrible thing?)  We also
        give each other a lot of jokes and toys, games and puzzles, and,
        of course, many many books.  Wanna make something of it?

                                    =*=

        Worst mall music of the season:  "God Rest You, Merry Gentlemen"
        done as if it were the "Theme from Gilligan's Island".

                                    =*=

        Fruitcakes aren't funny to me, by the way.  My Mom baked fruit
        cakes for us every year for many years and I have just recently
        taken over doing it because she cant handle the heavy stirring.
        The actual recipe is called nut cake. Maybe I'll run it here in
        next year's Christmas issue (to be published December 1993, no
        doubt) and yes, it is dense, and yes, it does keep a long time,
        but by golly it's good.

        I've been thinking of "things that are supposed to be funny that
        never really are funny" as a new category to fill out.  That
        would be fruitcakes, the &lt;mumble&gt; "from Hell", periphrastic
        paraphrases (although, as Desperados know, I've run a multitude
        of 'em), &lt;mumble&gt;'s "evil twin", "the evil twin of the fruitcake
        from Hell".

                                    =*=

        If you hadn't guessed, I love Christmas.

        So, God bless us every one.

        Yr. bdy,
        Tom Parmenter
