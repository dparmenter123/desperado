||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Oh, to be in Las Vegas on an expense account.

Oh, to be in Las Vegas.

Oh no!

Las Vegas gave me the hives.  It was probably the accumulation of a
long season of Micro/RSX, going to Decus, *and* being in Las Vegas,
but I broke out the first full day I was there, which was Sunday, and
didn't clear up until Wednesday.

I stayed in Caesar's Palace the first night.  My immense
responsibilities to Digital required that I be housed in a room that
the bellman described as "sex heaven".

Unfortunately, I had an open req on my sex staff and could not check
this out, but the room was really something.  A circular bed with a
circular lighted mirror over it and a sheer circular curtain around
it.  A huge oval solid marble tub on a platform with an oval lighted
mirror over it.  Twin marble sinks surrounded by mirrors.  A john
(with no mirror over it).  The general decor was blue, green, purple,
marble, silver, and gold. There was a purple "Cleopatra couch" in the
corner and green fuzz (intentional) on the walls.

I crashed there Saturday night and went out in the morning to check
out the scene.  On my way down in the elevator, a swarthy young guy with
cigar and Bermuda shorts explained Las Vegas philosophy to me:

        "Money doesn't mean anything here.  If you got it, it don't
         mean nothing, and if you ain't got it, it don't mean nothing,
         because nobody knows what they're doing here anyway."

He went on:

        "One thing about the casinos.  After the first 24 hours they
         look really seedy."

I emerged into the dim of the Caesar's Palace casino to find it filled
with drinking, smoking gamblers at 8 am on Sunday morning.  It looked
glamorous for about 24 seconds and then it started to look really
seedy.  I guess you can take the boy out of the Southern Methodist
church but you can't take the Southern Methodist church out of the
boy.  That's when I started to itch.

A woman on the plane had told me:

        "Las Vegas is for men.  Lots of lights.  Lots of smoking.
         Lots of drinking.  It's a party town."

She neglected to mention lots of women, but there were women all over
the place.  The cocktail waitresses and keno runners and so forth were
all in tights and push-em-up brassieres and swirling swooping hairdos
and most of the men had a woman following them around.  They generally
looked like wives.  The whole time I was there I only saw one
smashingly beautiful woman and she was a redhead paid by the hotel to
hang around in cream-colored silk dresses and aquamarine bikinis and
generally contribute to the ambiance of glamor.

We saw a bride in her wedding dress and veil and bridegroom in
decorated tux window shopping in the mall area of Caesar's Palace.

C's P had a bar called Cleopatra's Barge, mounted over water on
springs so as to seem to float.  Except for drinking fountains,
there's water everywhere in Las
Vegas.  Fountains, yes, but not many drinking fountains.  Water
means wealth and class in Las Vegas.  Fountains, pools, and gardens
everywhere.  The hotel plants are tended by armies of gardeners and
miles of piping and they apparently put out new growth all year long.
But the vacant lot next to the hotel is still desert.  The air on the
strip is desert air.  It throws Eastern sinuses into reverse.  We
drove out into the desert one day.  We saw fifteen kinds of plants
withing fifty feet of the car.  There's life in the desert, but
nothing you'd want on a casino lawn.

Another surprise:  You don't get silver dollars to play the slots!  You
get casino coins.  These seem to go just as fast as the silver dollars
would.  I ended up the week down $32 on the slots.  The slots are the
only gambling game I understood when I went there.  I understand it
better now.  I watched someone lose $6000 at blackjack and heard that
he had lost $80,000 over the week.  He didn't appear to be having any
more fun than I did losing my $32.

Also in the surprise department:  The quality of musicianship in Las
Vegas is low.  I thought it would be like New York or LA, with every
musician you encounter a quality player, but the string quartet in the
hotel restaurant and the rock bands and singer-pianist trios that
played the casinos were just ordinary, or worse.  And there was no
dancing anywhere.

There are no stores on the strip.  No news stands.  No hot dog stands.
Nothing.  Everything is inside.  Each hotel has a shopping mall
in the basement.  Creme de la Creme, Inc. operates the House of
Tourists for selling Hummel figurines.  There's Suzy Creamcheese,
which is embroidered, fringed tatty hippie women's clothing at immense
markups.  Marshall-Rousso, if you want to be a floozy, or just look
like one.  Circe's, women's clothing with frogs and sailboats on it.
(Circe, you'll recall, performed the easiest trick in all of classical
mythology, using sex appeal to turn men into swine.)  There were ma~rny,
many jewelry stores, selling gold, gold-plated, gold-filled, and
gold-colored jewelry at mighty rates.  There were paste gems - "Cubic
Zirconias. Is it or isn't it?" - and strange jeweler's names - none of
that phony dignity stuff for Glitter Gulch Jewelers, 14K Gold Peddler,
Gold Fever, or the Gold Factory.

Other Vegas businesses:  Joe's Ye Olde Dog Wash.  Terrible Herbst
Gasoline.  Finger Paints Nail Salon.  The Church of Truth.  The Chapel
of Stars.  The Church on the Strip.  Sights, Sounds, and Software
Wherehouse.  National School of Bartending.

There are three listings under Professional Societies in the Las Vegas
yellow pages:  American Academy of Neurological Orthopedic Surgeons.
Association of Part-time Professionals.  Las Vegas Jazz Society.

There are three air ambulance services in Las Vegas.

The phone book in my room had a torn-out page marking the Divorce
section.  One of the ads:

                E-Z WAY KITS

        DIVORCE KITS
        Annulment Kits
        Bankruptcy Kits
        Corporation Kits
        Change of Name Kits
        Custody Change Kits
        Adoption Kits
        Filing Wills

In other words, all the legal services you'll ever need in Las Vegas.

The DEC office in Las Vegas is on Flamingo Road.

There were lots of medical ads on TV, including two pregnant ladies at
a party discussing their choice of maternity hospital.  The winning
argument was that Valley Hospital was offering a 40 per cent maternity
discount.  The final line:  "Valley Hospital ... " Pats tum. Simpers.
" ... delivers."

All sorts of missing celebrities are doing tv commercials in Las
Vegas:  Forrest Tucker.  Dick Van Patten.  Ed Reimers (the ex-Allstate
"good hands" man).  And "skating celebrity Peggy Fleming".

Big local news story on tv:  Couple moving into house won on tv game
show.

Two good lines from Johnny Carson:

        "What is sis boom bah?

        "The sound of an exploding sheep."

        and

        "If Leonard Nimoy was missing, would anyone go in search of
         him?"

I figured out how to cure the rash on Monday night.  I was sitting in
my room in the MGM Grand, a much nicer, if less flashy hotel, when I
found the radio hidden inside the tv set.  I turned it on and got the
Rolling Stones.  I immediately discovered that if I didn't get up and
move around I would explode.  I kept dancing and exercising for about
a half-hour and felt a lot (a lot!) better. While I was doing this
John Cougar (who is now known as John Cougar Mellenkamp) was singing
the line: "It stops me itching when I jump up to my feet."  This was
true, and by going to my room and shaking my tambourine every evening
my skin cleared up by Wednesday and stayed clear the rest of the week.

Strange promo announcement for the "beautiful music" station heard
in the middle of the afternoon:

        "Whether you're starting your day or ending it, you just can't
         beat our beautiful music."

Seen in a street display:  Al Capone's bulletproof limousine with a
disembodied voice coming out of it saying "even illegal earnings are
subject to income tax".  This was an advertisement for the antique car
museum, one of two tourist attractions I managed to see.  Lots of nice
cars in that one, two tiny one-cylinder beauties built in Waltham,
Mass., and a Stanley Steamer built in West Newton, Mass., which is
home.

My other tourist attraction was the Omnimax theater, which has a domed
screen that fills the entire range of vision.  The movie, Flyers, was
a stirring little drama about stunt pilots.  The plot was not a plot,
but it led to spectacular flying scenes.  My favorite was a Ford
Trimotor flying over Hoover Dam by moonlight, a real art deco dream.
You also got to fly over the lip of the Grand Canyon in a biplane
and to go soaring at sunset.  There was a staged crash of a Corsair on
an aircraft carrier.  The most spectacular scene was when the young
stunt pilot decided to show the old stunt pilot that he *was* brave
enough and experienced enough to do a wingwalk over Grand Canyon
without a safety belt.  Well, he was brave enough to take off the
belt, but he fell just the same.  He fell and fell and fell and fell
and fell and continued falling for an incredibly long time before the
camera plane came diving down underneath him and caught him - with a
huge crash from the 20,000-watt, 24-track sound system.  What a show!

I did not get to Hoover Dam, or the Liberace Museum.  I did not see
the giant flashlight of Claes Oldenburg and I did not fly in the
vertical wind tunnel.  I did not see the Coasters, but I did see Joan
Rivers with the Smothers Brothers and Jim Stafford.  Funny people.

Decus was its usual self, despite the roccoco setting, with all the
gang from work in their unacustomed fancy duds, and all the users with
their strictly nonglobal interests.

DEC employes are like stars at Decus and the users are like fans.  The
users hang on our every word.  We threw ours into a tizzy with a
hypotetical elimination of MCR.  They want to know everything.  They
are enthralled.  They are outraged.  They are curious and cunning. And
us stars?  Well, its nothing but a job to us stars, and one with long
hours, at that.

The RSX SIG celebrated its Tenth Anniversary.  Somebody gave a talk on
SIGGEN.

Although Decus appeals to a distinct minority of users, even the Decus
users are getting more naive.  I talked to one guy who was so baffled
by file protection he'd made all his users privileged so they could
get at all the files they needed.  His users, the ingrates, responded
by playing Pacman at priority 125. and his question to me was "How do
I change the priority of an active task?"  We heard a lot more about
documentation than usual, which is no doubt the same phenomenon.

The Central Engineering area drew the biggest crowds at the DEC
exhibition.  The MicroVAX made a good showing with a robot doing block
I/O (piling up alphabet blocks).  They also liked the Micro/PDP-11 and
Micro/RSX (which was no surprise to me).  We had both the Micropower
Pascal music board and DECtalk as part of the RSX demo.  DECtalk
is just another terminal to the system.  We output help files to it,
had it telling jokes and narrating the demo, and, let people copy from
another terminal to the DECtalk.  It's a real kick to type in your
name (or indeed, any character string) and have it come back at you.
Without any munging, DECtalk read our help files as well as anyone
who'd never seen them would.  ODT was pronounced "ott", for instance,
but it doesn't seem to take much to fix text up.  We did get quite a
few odd returns from a customer's name, Stephen Mullarkey.

You can get any meal at any time in Las Vegas, and you can always get
a drink.  This makes it a good Decus town.  Otherwise, Decus and Las
Vegas are pretty much out of synch.  Las Vegas wasn't built by people
sitting in a room laughing at jokes about RSX version numbers or
learning how to write device drivers.  We all tried to gamble, but
nobody was flying very high.  Bunch of pikers.

So DEC chases money by trying once again to figure out just what it is
the users want while Las Vegas eliminates all the complication that a
product puts in the picture and just says give us your money and we
might give you some of it back.

It isn't that Las Vegas is artificial.  It's the reality. Wherever you
look you see the mountains and the desert.  And the people don't seem
phony at all.  They are all too real, all the workers in the hotels
and the croupiers had real eyes.  And the my honeymoon couples and the
long-married couples.  And the clatter and clangclang of the slot
machines was also real.

A song on the radio:  Strange Paradise.
