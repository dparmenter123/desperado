A Boston therapist decided to advertise in the phone book; a small
tasteful ad disclosing that she charges nothing for a preliminary
evaluative interview session.  Well, she tried.  But the phone company
tried harder.

The ad, which was supposed to say "Interview Therapist Without Charge"
said "Interview The Rapist Without Charge".  Needless to say, she got
interesting, if not useful, responses.

And what did the phone company say?  You guessed it...it was a COMPUTER ERROR.

Some hyphenation program, run amuck, no doubt.

Recently, RT-11 got an SPR complaining that when an optional patch
to disable certain features of the KED editor was installed, certain
features of KED stopped working....

Here, at last, is what happened in E.T. about the telephone.  More

Subject: DESPERADO: E.T. phones home

I saw "E.T." again last night and took careful notes on the "phone
home" sequence.  Here is what *really* happens:

 1. E.T. learns from the kids and the encyclopedia that earth is
    "home."

 2. The next day, while Elliott is in science class (learning how to
    dissect a frog), E.T. drinks his first Coors and then his second.

 3. He then plays with the word game, turns on the TV, and reads the
    funnies.

 4. The phone commercial comes on TV.  E.T. watches and then reads
    "Buck Rogers," from which he gets the idea for the communicator.

 5. In the meantime, Elliott lets all the frogs loose and kisses the
    girl.

 6. E.T. takes the word game apart and then takes it and a bunch of
    other stuff up to Elliott's room.

 7. Then Mom (whose name is Mary) and Gertie come home.  While Mom
    is trying to figure out what happened to the Coors and talking
    to the school about why Elliott would be acting intoxicated,
    Gertie watches a word game on TV.  E.T., who has been hiding
    behind the TV, says "b."  Gertie then prompts him into saying
    "good" and "phone."  She then asks E.T. if he wants to call
    somebody.

 8. Elliott comes home and goes up to his room where Gertie and E.T.
    now are.  E.T. says "Elliott" and then "E.T."  He shows the
    cartoon to the kids and says "phone" and "home."

 9. And THEN he says "E.T. home phone."  Gertie and then Elliott turn
    it around for him by repeating "E.T. phone home," which he then
    says.

10. Then E.T. says "come home" and learns the word "ouch."

Another surprise: I had assumed that E.T. controlled both flying
sequences, but it's really Elliott who does the one at the end.

Well, frogging seems to be the sport of the year, so if you want to
really get down, tell CACHE::ZAYAS.  Night dives and blue hole dives
extra.

        ***********  THANKSGIVING WEEK VACATION SUGGESTION ***********

        I am planning to go south for the week of Thanksgiving -- down
        Bahama-way.  I am hoping to spend the week at UNEXSO (Underwater
        Explorers Society) taking their one-week "Open Water Certification
        Course", basically a one-week "everything you need to know to SCUBA
        dive".

        This course is $275/person for the week, including all necessary
        equipment, instruction, and dives.  The deal is to start on Monday,
        22-November, and finish it on that Friday.  Saturday and Sunday, of
        course, are open for additional diving at your convenience/expense.

        The problem I've got (and the reason I'm sending this out) is that
        there must be at least 4 people to get the $275/person rate.  I'm
        going with a friend, leaving us 2 short.  If anyone out here in
        DEC-land would like to accompany us, please mail me (CACHE::ZAYAS).
        Decide and let me know soonest -- travel to/from that area during
        that week is going to be busy and reservations must be goten early!

        Please note that the fee for the week does not include the flight to
        Freeport, hotel, nor meals.  Suggested hotels in the area include the
        Lucayan Bay Hotel, the Atlantik Beach Hotel, and the Holiday Inn.
        If you are interested in diving on Saturday and Sunday, the fee is
        about $20 per dive -- night dives and blue hole dives extra.
