Subject: The DEC Philosophy?

The December 12 issue of Fortune contains an article titled
"How DEC Got Decked", remarking on our recent problems on Wall Street.
In part of the article, when discussing the marketing (so to speak) of
our PCs, the following gem of wisdom appears:

        "But Olsen, holding tight to DEC tradition that any decision
        worth making is worth making ten times, changed his mind..."

Received this year's homeowner's insurance policy today, and was
scanning through it.

It contains the usual Exclusion for War, as expected.  Interesting
though: "Discharge of a nuclear weapon shall be deemed a warlike
act even if accidental."

From this morning's Globe:

        Reagan signs bill banning 'phone sex'

The bill itself is pretty ordinary, but I love that headline.  Maybe now
the teenage pregnancy rate will drop because teenagers won't be able to
get pregnant over the phone anymore.

The following is reprinted from SIGPLAN Notices, December 1983.

It was written by Wes Munsil during discussions on the topic
of whether Pascal or C should be used in a project.

        Use C, or not use C, that is the question:
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The flags and warnings of a rude compiler,
        Or to take arms against a sea of errors,
        And by debugging, fix them?  To code, to hack,
        No more; and by a hack to say we end
        The type-check and the thousand other checks
        Pascal is heir to, 'tis a compilation
        Devoutly to be wish'd.  To code, to hack;
        To hack! perchance to test:  ay, there's the rub;
        For in that hacker's bliss what bugs may come,
        When we have written out this awful code,
        Must give us pause:  there's the respect
        That makes development of such long life.

I'd guess you've got an interesting typo.  I won't comment on translational
grammar, but I'd bet it should read

      "It's fascination let many people who seek for ROMANCE come near."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
A fair guess, of course, but the Japanese seem to use a lot of English
and English-like words in distinctly Japanese ways.  My son Dan
is a follower of Japanese animation and owns several (beautiful)
collections of animation art.  The text is mostly in Japanese, but the
titles are in the western character set:

                Final Yamato Roman      Queen Millenium Roman

The word roman means novel (romance) in many European languages, but
these books aren't novels, but compilations.  Dan thinks it means
something like "a wonderful experience".

By the way, SFLovers, Dan and his fellow Japanimaniacs are planning
quite a splash at Boskone this year.  More later.

Subject: Desparados looking for Demento

I have discovered a demented group of Desparados who mourn the
depature of Dr. Demento from Boston's WCOZ. 'COZ claims that Dr. D
dosen't fit with their "new image" (Homogenized rock from the video
acrade) so they discontinued it.

Our query to Desparado is "Does anyone know who is carrying it
within the wider Boston area?"

My favorite Demento lyric:

        Life could be
        Oh so sweet
        If I were a bicycle seat.
        Ride, ride, little cheek.
        Sit on me.
        I'm a bicycle seat.

This is done to a merry calypsonian rhythm.

On our way to visit my in-laws in New Jersey, we passed on I-80 a
motor home pulling a camper trailer.  The motor home was white with a
(if I remember correctly) green stripe, and painted in the stripe was
the model name "Brave".  The trailer had a similar paint job, with a
similar stripe, in which was painted the word "Coward".

Here's a fairly decent bumper sticker I saw at the CX (Colorado Springs
manufacturing plant, not to be confused with KS, where the real (software)
work gets done...) parking lot:

        If you don't like how I drive, get off the sidewalk!

With all due respect to our Friends from Across the Sea, the closest I ever
came to being bumped off (the sidewalk, I mean) was at the market in the
town square in Cambridge, UK.  The interesting side of this is that I hold
not only a Colorado drivers license, but also one from England, and having
taken two times to pass an incredible drivers test in England, I fail to see
how the drivers can be so wild there.  Why, they almost rival the drivers
in Boston!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
A friend of mine (from Boston) dreams of the bumper sticker

        I'll share the road with a runner
        When they share the sidewalk with a car.

As for rivaling the Boston drivers . . . Nah!

The only thing I ever do on a VMS system these days is read NOTES
files.  I was delighted to find that the following definition in your
LOGIN.COM file puts your real node name into NOTES rather than the
name of the node on which you happen to be doing NOTES:

        $DEFINE SYS$NODE KERMIT::

or whatever.  Be sure to include the two colons.

My favorite NOTES:

        $NOTES VAXWRK::SYS$NOTES:TRIVIA
