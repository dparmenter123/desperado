Announcing! The Spit Brook Singers in Concert!

You've probably wondered why you haven't been able to reserve the
Babbage Auditorium for lunchtime on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the
last half of forever, well, dears, you're about to find out!

The silver-throated Spit Brook Singers will present a concert for
your noon-time dancing pleasure on Thursday, June 20. A repeat performance
will be presented on Tuesday, June 25. The performance will take place
at 12 noon in Babbage Auditorium, just off the lobby of ZKO1.

The concert includes choral works of Heinrich Isaac, Josquin des Pres,
Giovanni Croce, Sir Arthur Sullivan, Franz "Papa" Haydn, Pachelbel (of
course it's the Canon, what else did he write?) and various other lights.
Music ranges from the Renaissance to the 50's.

The Spit Brook Singers perform under the able direction of Joanne
Warburton-Russell of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus and winner of the
1985 Anna Russell Prematurely Memorial Sound-alike Contest. The Singers
include prominent Desperadim of all varieties, and representatives of
many fine choral groups throughout the Digital community.

Plan to attend the Spit Brook Singers' Summer Concert!
