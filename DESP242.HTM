        Well, at this point it was just beginning to seem that Perot had
        de-wussed himself and was actually coming to resemble something
        like a national ornament when his little clock went off and told
        him it was time to go mental again.  Too bad.  No one ever wanted
        Perot to get elected, of course, because he just doesn't have the
        personality or the stuff (even the wrong stuff that Bush has), but
        if his aim was to build himself into a Great Man who has to be
        listened to when everyone else (including Clinton, of course) is
        ducking the issues, it's going right out the window.  Too bad, it
        would really have been neat to have him around.  Of course, about
        half the time we'd really hate it.

            "The Fat Girl From Wilson Phillips"

        Some people took offense at that one, but I have actually heard
        this woman (don't know which one she is) introduce herself on
        radio as "the fat one".  After all, the Wilson Phillips girls are
        descended from some bands with large members, Mamas and Papas and
        Beach Boys.  (Hmm, maybe instead of WP, they should have named
        themselves Mama's Boys.)

        sweating to get some truth he figured out into a form that will
        appeal to the great American public and make us love more and hate
        less and by the time it gets to Spain it's shrunk down to  half a
        line with the the word "you" in there somewhere and its only
        remaining function is to make Spaniards think it is hip to buy
        lots of boxes of irradiated milk.

&gt;       1492 -- not what you think.  The year that Isabela ran the Jews
&gt;       and Moors out of Spain.  Jews, Arabs, and Christians had lived
&gt;       together in Spain for 800 years,

But not in peace.  The North African province of the Byzantine Empire
(encompassing the present nations of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria),
which had been Christian, fell to the Arabs during the Islamic Jihad in
the late 600s. Christians were either forcibly converted to Islam, driven
out, or killed outright.  A second Jihad was started by the Moors of
Morocco when they were converted to Islam.  They crossed the straits of
Gibraltar and invaded the Iberian peninsula.  All of Spain was overrun
except for a few mountain conclaves in the North.  When the Moors of Spain
fell to bickering amongst themselves, the Spanish were able to refound
their kingdoms (Castilla, Navarra (Basque, I think), and  Aragon
(Catalonia)).  Over the next several centuries, during which there was
nearly constant warfare, they gradually reconquered the peninsula.  The
marriage between Fernando of Aragon and Isabela of Castilla united those
kingdoms and together they were strong enough to finally reduce the
Emirate of Granada in the far south to complete the reconquest.

Bottom line is that the Moors and Catholics were constantly at each
other's throats.  Both sides grudgingly tolerated the Jews, who were
useful as moneylenders (both Islam and Catholicism as practiced at the
time prohibited the lending of money at interest).

&gt;       but by 1492 the Catholics were
&gt;       really feeling their oats and Isabela concluded it would be a good
&gt;       time to get rid of the Moors and Jews.  They were kicked out with
&gt;       only what they could carry.  Some were able to transfer liquid
&gt;       assets.  For this forced expulsion,  Isabela earned the title of
&gt;       "The Catholic" from the Pope himself.  Over and over you see or
&gt;       hear references to this or that admirable activity that suddenly
&gt;       ended in 1492 and never started again.

Kicking out the Moors was merely sauce for the gander.  Kicking out the Jews
was a very bad move, as it removed the sole source of investment capital and
just about destroyed the Spanish economy.  Part of why Isabela was willing to
listen to crackpots like Columbus is that Spain was nearly destitute and the
treasury was willing to try anything to get new sources of income.

&gt;       Fernando hardly rates a mention and is certainly not "The
&gt;       Catholic".

I've always heard of Fernando and Isabela referred to in Spanish as "Los
Reyes Catolicos" (the Catholic monarchs - note the plural).  I have never heard
of Isabela alone referred to as "La Reina Catolica" (the Catholic queen).

        Well, in the Royal Palace in Madrid you'll find side-by-side
        statues labelled "Isabela la Catolica" and "Fernando".  A friend
        recalls seeing a movie theater called "Isabela la Catolica".  The
        Spanish I talked to thought the name was very funny.

        Thanks for all the history, but aside from economics and wars,
        it's clear in Spain that Moors, Jews, and Catholics had profound
        effects on each other in food, architecture, art, language,
        decoration.  Both the Moors and the Jews had a great deal to do
        with the creation of what we think of as characteristically
        Spanish ways and styles.  They weren't always at war with each
        other.  Worse than driving away investment capital was driving
        away intellectual and moral capital that could have had an
        unimagined effect on the development of both Europe and America.

        In addition to driving out Jews, many were forcibly converted to
        Catholicism or converted for their own protection.  These people
        soon became targets of the Inquisition, which was much more
        anti-Semitic than we're usually told.

Subj:   No More Bloody Brits

Russian immigrant Alexander Volk, 14, last week underwent what doctors
at Beersheba's Soroka Hospital called the first brit by surgical laser.
Volk, who has a blood disorder that prevents his blood from clotting,
insisted on undergoing the painless, 45-minute operation, and was sent
home after 24 hours.  "Like every good Jew who lives in this country,
it was important for Alex to have a brit," said his grandmother Idka, 73.

Brit is the Sephardic pronunciation, bris is the Ashkenazic pronunciation.
(Actually, the vowel should be more like "ee," but it's popularly "i"
especially when the Ashenazic pronunciation is used.)

Modern Hebrew (as spoken in Israel) uses the Sephardic pronunciation.
There's no "th" sound in any pronunciation of Hebrew that I've ever heard.
I imagine that the use of "th" is some philologist's way of saying it's
an aspirated "t".

        Dan and Marilyn Quayle are both lawyers living off a newspaper
        fortune.  Their hobby is attacking lawyers and newspapers.

This makes a wierd sort of sense, actually.  Attacking lawyers
is good for the newspaper business.  Suing newspapers is certainly
good for lawyers.

Attacking newspapers even helps sell newspapers (so newspapers
generally are happy to print the attacks, and don't mind a
bit).  And sueing lawyers helps keep up their employment.

And if they don't sue, they can always write letters threatening
to sue if the attacks aren't withdrawn.

Being the U*x wienie that I am, I can't resist pointing out that the error you
cite in the Unix (tm) poem is in fact not an error:

R is for Ranlib, for sorting ar [sic] table.
                                ^^^^^
"ranlib," in effect sorts "archive" files for efficient loading.  The "archive"
command, of course, is spelled "ar"...

        Being the word wienie that I am, I can't resist pointing out that
        the interjected [sic] does not mean "This is an error."  The
        translation of the Latin word "sic" is "so" or "thus".  In English
        and American usage, it means "This is exactly how it was written,
        so don't correct it."

        So (or thus) when [sic] appears after an error, it should be
        indicating, "Yeah, yeah, I know it's wrong", not "Look at what a
        yoyo this type is and, conversely, how smart I am."

I haven't yet read most of the political mail that you guys have been
sending, but I thought you'd be interested in this one from an internal
Apple discussion:

Answers to yesterday's Arthur I. Blaustein quiz from Wednesday's SF
Chronicle.  The post-World War II president who did the best in each of
the following areas:

1) Highest growth in the gross domestic product? Truman

2) Highest growth in jobs? Carter

3) Biggest increase in personal disposable income after taxes? Johnson

4) Highest growth in industrial production? Kennedy

5) Biggest rise in hourly wages? Johnson

6) Lowest "Misery Index" (inflation plus unemployment)? Truman

7) Lowest inflation? Truman

8) Lowest interest rates on long-term treasury bonds? Truman

That's right - all Democrats, every one of them.  Which, of course, was
Blaustein's point, as he wanted to "destroy the myth that the economy has
performed better under Republican than Democratic presidents".

Answer to the bonus question: since 1900, the Dow Jones industrial average
has risen an average of 7.3% per year during Republican administrations
and 10.1% per year during Democratic administrations.

        So what parts of your body can you crack, wiggle, maneuver, wield,
        or manipulate that most folks can't?

I can crack the place where my legs intersect my pelvis by pressing my
knees together.  It makes a sick soft crunchy sound.

I can crack my nose about once every two months, by inserting a finger and
pressing on the cartilage.  This is also very disgusting.

I can crack my shoulders by placing hands on my ribs and pressing.  Elbows
cracked by slowly overextending each arm.

I can crack my ankles by gently squatting in the morning, or by twisting my
feet, or by holding each foot by the instep and forcing the ankle outward.
I can crack tarsals &amp; carpals by pressing from the palm side through each
paw (for the ones on the ends) or by firmly pulling each digit.

A hint for digit-crackers and aikido enthusiasts: a sankyo can crack at

What with all the talk of blondes and legs in the last issue of Desperado and
the maelstrom of political activity heralding yet another opportunity to send
some bozo to the White House with a Mandate from the People, this following
seems rather timely. I guess that, just like Ronald Reagan's hair, some things
never change.

        A boy is hitchhiking on a country road. A car stops for him, and the
        driver asks, "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"

        "Democrat," says the boy, and the car speeds off.

        Another car stops, and the driver asks, "Are you a Republican or a
        Democrat?"

        "Democrat," says the boy, and the car speeds off.

        This happens two or three times, and the boy decides he's giving the
        wrong answer. The next car that stops is a convertible driven by a
        beautiful blonde. "Are you a Republican or a Democrat," she asks.

        "Republican," says the boy, and she lets him in.

        But as they're driving along, the wind from the open top begins to
        push the blonde's skirt higher and higher up her legs. And the boy
        finds himself becoming aroused. Finally he can't control himself any
        longer. "Stop!" he hollers. "Let me out! I've only been a Republican
        for ten minutes and I already feel like screwing somebody!"

           At the Los Alamos, New Mexico, National Laboratory,
   birthplace of the hydrogen bomb, nuclear scientists met in February
   to find nonmilitaristic projects to apply their skills to. A favorite one
   was to develop ways to detect, intercept and bomb killer comets en
   route to a collision with Earth. One scientist called for building a
   fleet of 1,200 new missiles armed with the world's entire arsenal of
   nuclear warheads.  Another scientist got so excited by the prospect
   that he shouted from the back of the auditorium, "Nukes forever!"

I read another account of this episode that mentioned the name of the
aforementioned scientist: Lowell Wood.  I worked at Livermore Labs in
Lowell's "O Group" for a year and got very familiar with Lowell's
sense of humor.  Sorry to disappoint everyone, but there is no way
that Lowell just "got excited" and happened to blurt out that phrase.
He knew what he was saying, he was surely grinning when he said it, he
was being intentionally outrageous, and (it's hard to explain this) it
was meant ironically and seriously at the same time.

This genre of humor was popular in "O Group", though not at the rest
of the lab.  One of the "O group" physicists wrote a song, to the tune
of "Camelot", called "Megatons", wistfully extolling the virtues of
hydrogen bombs.  He once got up on a chair and performed it in the
middle of one of the Lab's lunchrooms; the people from the rest of the
lab were not amused and tried as hard as possible to ignore him.

Subj:   From my experience, this is what CS grad school is really like ...

... but he shouldn't have let the secret out.
                                                        -- Jerry

22-May-87 19:26    Olin.Shivers@h.cs.cmu.edu    Presentation announcement

It's common knowledge that whenever you get two or more CS grad students
together, the conversation will inevitably drift to the same topic:
automatic weapons.  Lately, we've noticed that whenever we attend a CS party,
picnic, or bullsession, we always hear the same questions and discussions,
usually from the younger grad students:

    "When I switched from guncotton to standard ball powder on my .223 loads,
     the gas ports on my M16 would clog like you wouldn't believe.  Steer clear
     of that stuff."

    "You haven't cleared an ejection port jam until you've cleared one in
     the Hill district at 4:00 AM on a Saturday morning."

    "I want to mount an M60 in front of the sun roof of my Tercel, but
     the mounting bracket wasn't drilled for import cars. How did Josh
     Bloch do his?"

    "What exactly are those special 'conference rounds' that Newell hand loads
     before AAAI every year?"

    "Some of my friends at the MIT AI Lab don't like M203's because the
     grenade launcher adds too much weight, but I wouldn't have gotten
     out of IJCAI-85 in one piece if it hadn't been for those 40mm flechette
     rounds.  What do you think?"

    "Do you have to be a god-damned tenured professor to get teflon rounds
     at this place?"

    "Does the 'reasonable person principle' cover hosing down a member
     of the Soar project after he's used the phrase 'cognitively plausible'
     for the fifteenth time in a 20 minute conference talk?"

    "Where *did* Prof. Vrsalovic get that Kalashnikov AK-47?"

    "I used to use Dri-Slide to lube my M16.  How come my advisor says
     Dri-Slide is for momma's boys and Stanford profs?"

    "Does the way Jon Webb keeps flicking the safety of his Mac-10 on
     and off at thesis defenses make you nervous, too?"

In short, there is a lot of concern in this department for the proper care,
handling and etiquette of automatic weapons.  So as a service to the
department, we are starting a two week daily series on "The Care and Handling
of Your M16A1." Every day for the next two weeks, we will post on the wall
outside our office the day's helpful hint on care and maintenance of that good
old departmental standby:  the M16A1.  Our thanks to the US Army, whose
training manuals we have shamelessly cribbed for material.

We would like to encourage other knowledgeable members of the CS community to
share their expertise in a similar fashion.  There is a real need for this
kind of dialogue in the department.  The new students come in here every fall,
and are totally unequipped to handle the realities of graduate student life at
CMU.  Computability theory and lexical scoping are fine things to know about,
but they just don't cut the mustard when somebody from the Psych department
opens up on you with an Ingram set to full auto.

Subject: Supporting one's opinion with sustained fully automatic
weapons fire.

I had recent occasion to view your Presentation Announcement on care
and feeding of automatic weapons during lecture hall. I found it most
amusing. I would very much like to see and/or contribute future
material.

We have similar problems here at Berkeley, though it has been difficult
to wean our students away from more the more mundane assortment of
Browning Hi-Power's, Beretta 92SBF's and Sig-Sauer P226's.  The 9mm clique
is pretty strong here, and the young grad students fairly parsimonious.
They tend to balk at the idea of spending enough money on ammo to make
full auto firefights practical. Lately, they've taken to sniping at each other
from the Campanille tower and engaging in loose hit-and-run guerrilla tactics
during finals. This is obviously not the American Way and needs to be changed.
While I've been able to slowly ween them into more progressive arms (such
as the Beretta 93R and an occasional mini-uzi), I still can't seem to get
past the supply problem. My questions are:

    "Do you buy your ammo in bulk, or do appointed individuals
        do shifts on a progressive reloader?"

    "Does the school pay for this?"

                Thank you.

                    Sincerely,

part III
My reply to Mr. Hubbard of UC Berkeley:
- - - -----
Mr. Hubbard-

Thank you for your letter.  It was certainly interesting to hear of conditions
out on the West Coast.  What can I tell you about the situation here at CMU?
I'm really glad I came to CMU.  The faculty is absolutely first rate, and
they all take pride in their weapons skills.  We are admittedly a pretty
opinionated bunch, which provides for many interesting interchanges within the
community.  I, for instance, think the long barrel .44 Automag is more of a
fashion statement than a weapon, though you won't catch me saying that within
earshot of Prof. Fahlman.  If you catch my drift.

Yes, I am aware of the West Coast predilection for 9mm pistolry.  When I was
an undergraduate, I spent one summer doing AI hacking at the MIT AI Lab.  We'd
hired this west coast guy to do Lisp hacking, and I can clearly remember being
a little stranged out by his attitudes.  He just wouldn't shut up about
Interlisp and Browning Hi-Power's.  Every time I tried to explain to him the
way our project did things, he'd interrupt with "the right way," i.e. the West
Coast Way, to do it.  He just couldn't get it through his head that I didn't
want to hear about Interlisp, and I damn sure didn't want to hear about
9-fu1king-millimeter automatics; we were a Zetalisp/.223 project.  I finally
gave up on him; that was the first time I'd ever personally encountered the
east coast/west coast split in Lisp style and weapons choice.

I'm not quite as adamant about that sort of thing as I used to be.  I guess
these days I tend to have a "whatever gets the job done" attitude -- even if
it's franz or a .22 Woodsman.  But I've always thought that the west coast was
really missing out on a good thing.  I mean, on the east coast, public comment
sometimes requires you to tuck a Beretta discreetly away in a shoulder
holster.  But when you are in Berkeley, it being the sort of place that it is,
you can stroll down the street toting your automatic rifle of choice without
so much as raising an eyebrow.

I am very fond of Berkeley.  I think that while LA represents the dark, twisted
climb-the-water-tower-and-start-shooting-until-the-Marines-settle-it
side of California weirdness, Berkeley represents the very best of the pure,
innocent-killer side of it all.  The first weekend I ever spent in Berkeley
was in the summer of 1983.  I was sitting down at one of those really
delightful cafes you have out there.  To my left some old man was drinking
cappucino and practicing Chinese calligraphy; down the street some
undergraduates were engaged in a running firefight.  I was taking it all in,
thinking that Berkeleians have remembered something about living well that the
rest of America seems to have forgotten, when this kid's stray .223 slug
shattered my glass of pomegranate soda.  "Crazy undergraduates" I remember
chuckling to myself as I put the safety back on my Hi-Power and returned it
to its holster.

It seems a shame that ammunition is so hard to come by out there, though.  We
are quite spoiled here at CMU.  The departmental attitude towards logistical
support really crystallised for me in September of my first year.  One of the
incoming first-year hot-shots had taken out Prof. Felton with a head shot
from 500 yards.  We were all really impressed, and I think it was generally
agreed that Felton couldn't have asked for a more painless, appropriate end.
It was a beautiful, almost poetic way to cap what had been a textbook career
of brilliant, original mathematical insights punctuated with outbursts of
random, deeply unhinged violence.  Many were the stories of Felton told that
week -- we were particularly touched that, in a very real sense, he'd died
with his boots on.  He may have been all of 65, but his .357 Magnum had been
in his hand when he hit the ground, a reflexive feat of almost mystical
proportions, considering that by the time he'd become aware of the danger to
himself, most of his processing hardware had become so much organic garbage
heading west at Mach 1.

You've probably heard of Felton (National Academy of Science, IEEE Past
President, NRA sustaining member).  My advisor told me later that Felton's
academic peak had come at that now-infamous 1982 Symposium on Data Encryption,
when he presented the plaintext of the encrypted challenge message that Rob
Merkin had published earlier that year using his "phonebooth packing"
trap-door algorithm.  According to my advisor, Felton wordlessly walked up to
the chalkboard, wrote down the plaintext, cranked out the multiplies and
modulus operations by hand, and wrote down the result, which was obviously
identical to the encrypted text Merkin had published in CACM.  Then, still
without saying a word, he tossed the chalk over his shoulder, spun around,
drew and put a 158grain semi-wadcutter right between Merkin's eyes.  As the
echoes from the shot reverberated through the room, he stood there, smoke
drifting from the muzzle of his .357 Magnum, and uttered the first words of
the entire presentation: "Any questions?" There was a moment of stunned
silence, then the entire conference hall erupted in wild applause.  God, I
wish I'd been there.

But I digress.  At Felton's funeral, our departmental chairman delivered the
eulogy.  I'll never forget his summation:  "Poor Felton.  Published, and
published, and perished just the same." And that's the attitude that the
professors take here.  As my advisor said: "The tragedy of Galois is that he
could have contributed so much more to mathematics if he'd only spent more
time on his marksmanship."  The professors at CMU aren't in the business of
turning out effete researchers, aimed at the big industrial labs.  They are
interested in training *real* academicians, suitably prepared for life in the
jungle of university-level computer science.  And that means time spent
practicing our teaching skills and weapons handling *as well as* making
fundamental research contributions to the field.  The department does not care
to just crank out PhD's, half of whom aren't going going to make it through
their first semester as a junior professor without winding up in a body bag.
They are committed to a solid grounding in small arms fire, and if that means
spending some grant money for the necessary resources, they are ready to stand
up to the line.

So the short answer is, the department supplies us with all the ammunition
we can use, and then some.  Any caliber; any load configuration.  They even
keep those crazy Czechs supplied, who come in here every year with the
absolutely strangest knock-off versions of other countrys' guns that you have
ever laid eyes on.  The free ammunition has some nice side effects, too:  the
campus police never, ever give CS grad students parking tickets.  And you just
wouldn't believe how attentive the students are in the courses we TA.

I was chatting with my father on the phone the other night, on the
occasion of his 85th birthday (!), and we turned to baseball.  He told
me some details that I had never heard before.  It seems that his family
lived in north St. Louis, just a couple of blocks from Sportsman's Park
of fond memory.  (Which as recently as my junior HS years was shared by
the Cardinals and the Browns!)  This part I knew, of course.

The "new" stuff he told me was that at the age of 14 or 15 he used to
hang around in the evening with some of the Cardinals' players, 5 or 6
of whom lived in a boarding house a block or so from my father's house.
He'd sit on the porch, listening to these guys swear and spit tobacco
and rehash the day's ball game.  One of these players, who was my
father's particular favorite, natch, was Rogers Hornsby.

My father said he would often encounter Hornsby in the late afternoon,
walking home from the ballpark.  Picture this!  One of the greatest
baseball stars of that or any time walking home from the park to his
boarding house; no reporters, no hordes, just a few friendly hellos from
neighborhood kids and folks (cf. "Eight Men Out" or whatever that movie
was called).  Hornsby used to call my father "Kid".  (And probably any
other youngster.)

So there you are: one of the rare triple-crown winners, and the last
major leaguer to bat over .400 in consecutive seasons (at least three, I
think), had a modest acquaintance with my very own ancestor.  Almost
like taking piano lessons from a teacher whose teacher's teacher's
teacher was Beethoven.

It's claimed that everyone is connected to everyone else in the world
(present, certainly, maybe past, don't know about future) by a chain
of no more than two other people.  So far I've discovered connections
to Groucho Marx, Pamela Smart, Rogers Hornsby, Rod Serling, and Jimi
Hendrix.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        At least one Sabremetrician, baseball statistics geek, concluded
        that Rogers Hornsby was the greatest baseball player of all time
        (despite having a superfluous "s" in each of his names).

        As for the "chain of two" theory, I had heard it as "chain of
        six", but my chain to Richard Nixon is only two people long.
        However, that makes jo's chain to Nixon three people long, unless
        he's got another chain.  If his chain to Pamela Smart was only one
        long, and if Pamela knew Nixon, then . . .

        I have a chain of two to Jeffrey Dahmer, through one of his
        victims, and a chain of two to the late Rev. Jim Jones through the
        late doctor who mixed the bug juice.  Ugh.

        On a slightly less morbid note, each time you breath in you inhale
        50 molecules that were once breathed by Cleopatra.

Subj:   Pennies

About 5 years ago I started collecting pennies.  My goal was to get to
$1,000.   Why?  For the hell of it.  Most folks had a lot of trouble with
that as the  answer, but it was true.  I completed the project in the
spring of 1991.

Basically it worked by me not spending any pennies, buying any penny
collections  I could get my hands on, and having friends at work save them
up for me.  With  one exception I think I paid for every one.  The
exception was when a frined  moved around my birthday and gave me $60
worth.  Mmmm!  What a riot.

Anyway, its not an expensive hobby.  It does cost something in lost
interest,  but that one gift about covered it.  The one other expense was
buying a rubber  stamp (and stamp pad) with the number 07998678 on it.
This was needed because  no bank will take rolled coins without one's
account number on them, and writing  07998678 on 2000 rolls gives me
writer's cramp just thinking about it.

One of the best parts was cashing them in.  I did it in two batches of
about  $500 each.  The first batch took about 25 minutes during lunch time
and tied up  one of two tellers at a local branch.  Lots of odd looks from
amusement to  wonder to disbelief to annoyance.

The second batch was at a much larger branch.  The coin teller and I took
the  pennies into the safe deposit vault.  We spent a delightful 20 minutes
sitting  on the floor stacking and counting the rolls.

At about the $900 mark I finally started wondering what to do with them
once I  had ammassed my pile.  (Duh!)  I bought the following:

        - Times Atlas (that's Times of London, and it is a pissa atlas)
        - book on Shogi
        - bullwhip
        - blowgun
        - unicycle
        - portable CD player
        - about 10 CD's
        - Chinese checker's set
        - Omni magazine subscription
        - other stuff that isn't coming to mind

And now I'm off on my second 1000.  I figure it will take about 4 more
years.   I've spent less that 25 pennies in the past 5 years, and have
forgotten how.

Subject: Touching Hawks
To: Hang-Gliding@fuggles.acc.Virginia.EDU

    There's been some discussion on the net concerning flying with hawks
    and eagles, so I guess it's time to relate MY story(ies).

    Throughout my flying career I've had lots of experiences flying with
    the big birds, and the thing that I find most fascinating about it is,
    that in most cases, the hawk or eagle seems to regard me as one of
    them.  It's like going on a wild animal safari, jumping out of the jeep
    and hunting prey with the lions. I'm in their world, not just looking
    at them from the other side of a fence.

    I've seen red-tails look right at my face from just beyond my outside
    tip as we circle together in a thermal, and they seem to be aware that
    the thing that's in control of that big bird is one of those things
    that normaly walks around on two legs.

    I've seen a group of young red-tails line up single file on the edge of
    a soarbable knoll, and one by one, stand still, stretch their wings
    out to full span, and then take three or four steps down the hill on
    their claws and launch, just like hang gliders. True story! They were
    imitating hang gliders!

    A few years ago in, in the late fall, I was soaring at Ft. Funston on a
    smooth, buoyant straight westerly day. Just over the golf course,  I
    noticed one of the locals (red-tailed hawk) parked over the trees at my
    altitude, probably looking for lunch. (I believe biologists refer to
    this maneuver as "kiting" ). Anyway, I approached the hawk from the
    north and as I got closer I noted that it was looking sideways at me,
    but showed no intention of moving. I guessed that it had been around
    enough hang gliders in its career that it wasn't bothered with my
    presence. I got close enough so that as I did a gentle 180 away from
    it, my outside tip came to within a few feet of it. My intent was to
    convince the hawk to forget about lunch for a few minutes and to come
    and play me with me.  I looked back after rolling out of the turn and,
    as I had hoped, there was my red-tailed buddy, following me.  I cruised
    north to the end of the bowl in front of the golf course and began a
    slow roll back to the south.  Keeping formation,  the hawk began to
    turn just as I did, so that when we'd both rolled out, I was following
    him (her?). As we came upon the south end of the bowl, she began to
    roll back to the north, which I mimicked, so that she  was again
    following me.

    We repeated this routine several times, creating, as far as I knew, the
    world's first impromptu avian/human aerial ballet. I was amazed at the
    connection I had made with this untamed animal.

    After several minutes of this, my new flying buddy remembered that she
    was hungry, broke our formation, and headed back to her original
    "kiting"  spot.  Since I wasn't ready to stop playing yet, I climbed
    just a bit higher than her, turned just a bit downwind,  rolled out and
    lined up on her six-o-clock and passed about 3 feet over her head.
    During this close pass, she never altered her position,  and her head
    movements indicated that she was alternating between scanning the
    ground just below her, and attempting to look up and behind her as I
    approached from her six-o-clock high. I noted that it was difficult for
    her to twist her neck enough to see above or behind her.

    I have learned that biologists try not anthropomorphize animal
    behavior; that is to say; to not interpret an animal's behavior or
    motivation as anything resembling our own. However, I'm sure that my
    red-tailed friend must have found my close passes to be a good comprise
    of her need to search for lunch and a desire to clown around with me. I
    made several of these passes, with my basetube passing as close as 3
    feet over her back (upper fuselage, torso?) , and she never flinched.

    The temptation was too much. I knew that  my friend would soon spot a
    tasty, warm, writhing mammal in the trees and dive for lunch, or
    another hang glider would come along and break up our party. I had an
    opportunity to do what non-pilots can't even dream about.

    I had to do it.

    On my final pass, I started my run just a little bit lower. The wind
    was straight west at about 20 mph. Our sink rates were almost exactly
    the same in the buoyant ridge-lift. I pulled in just a bit, increasing
    my closure rate to a still dream-like 2 mph. Time stretched, warmed to
    a diffused glow.  The hawk's attentions were no longer half-focused on
    the ground. She tried to looked up over her back, at me. Wings twisting
    in smooth correction of airspeed, to match mine. Closure rate almost
    imperceptible.  Her wings now directly  under me, one foot below my
    basetube.

    I reached down with my right hand and lightly tapped her on the back.

    A sudden realization must have come over the hawk, like when a puppy
    and a kitten play with each other, then realize that their instincts
    tell them that it's not the way they're supposed to behave.

    As I passed in front of her, she rolled to the right, almost ninety
    degrees, and perfunctorily extended her talons. It wasn't a panicked or
    frightened gesture, but more like the hawk body-language equivalent of
    "It's been fun, but if my mate catches me fooling around with you,
    you're in big trouble. So, leave...now, or my instincts will force me
    to tear through your Oakley Factory Pilot Eyeshades and  scratch your
    eyes out!"

    So I left.

    I headed back to launch ...back to the world of humans, and thought
    about what I'd done.  Oh, sure, it was a beautiful thing, and I could
    have kept my hands to myself. But maybe I was doing just what the
    writer of "High Flight" had suggested. To "slip the surly bonds of
    earth...reach out a hand, and touch the face (back?) of God."

        "Don't love me to death 'cause i ain't ready to die", last ish's
        epigraph, came from Big Joe Turner, the Boss of the Blues,
        specifically, from "Roll 'Em, Pete".  Pete was Pete Johnson,
        boogie-woogie artiste and Big Joe's partner for many years.  "Roll
        'Em, Pete" is one of many contenders for the title of first
        rock&amp;roll song ever.  This ish's epigraph is from Sonny Boy
        Williamson (Chess label version).

        If this is the last you'll see of me before the election, don't
        forget to vote early and often and, in between, lie to pollsters.

        Have a nice dream,
        Yr. bdy.,
