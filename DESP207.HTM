        Pete found a bottle and opened it.  Out came this djinn.

        "I grant you a boon for freeing me, master, a boon of three wishes
        I grant you," proclaimed the djinn, a handsome fellow in a neat
        grey suit, not your usual palace thug with turban and scimitar.

        Pete had read "The Monkey's Paw" (actually, a third-generation
        comic-book tribute-parody-ripoff of "The Monkey's Paw") and he knew
        the dangers of wishes.

        But Pete thought he was smarter than the greedy folks in the
        stories.

        "I wish for peace, wisdom, and a long life."

        "O master, your wishes are granted," said the djinn, and turned
        Pete into a rock.

        The editor of "Computers &amp; Security" reports:

        "This morning, prior to sitting down to write this section, we were
        in the unclassified portion of a classified network.  We needed to
        obtain information from an open network run by a branch of the
        military.  We performed an FTP (file transfer protocol) and faced a
        sign-on screen.  When prompted for a name, we used ANONYMOUS; in
        response for a password we entered PASSWORD.  We were then able to
        access the system.  (We later learned that unauthorized users *had*
        to use ANONYMOUS as a name or else it was not possible to gain
        access.  As for a password, the system would accept anything
        provided that it was eight characters in length.)

        "Because we encountered excessive noise on the communications line,
        we logged off and several minutes later tried again.   This time we
        reached a wrong number, *but* it was a computer, one belonging to a
        corporation whose communications security officer is one of our
        friends.  The system is one of the more secure ones with which we
        are familar.  However, a sign-on screen is always tempting.  We
        logged in with his name.  In response to the password request, we
        entered BIG CHIEF, a favorite answer of his when asked about his
        duties.  When informed that we had entered an incorrect password, we
        concatenated the two words and added a !.  To our surprise we
        gained access to the system."

WRONG!!!!

The state song is Yankee Doodle, not Yankee Doodle Dandy.  They're
2 separate songs.

Yankee Doodle starts out:

Yankee Doodle went to town. .

Yankee Doodle Dandy (think James Cagney in movie of same name)

I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, a Yankee Doodle do or die.....

This was also a question of Jeopardy and the contestant made the

Connecticut's ratification of the U.S. Constitution put the Grand Old
Document over the top, so inmates there print "Constitution State" on
the license plates.  'Course, the Nutmeg State achieved this weighty
historical distinction by futzing around until all the other states
had ratified.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I need more data on this Yankee Doodle skew  before I admit I was WRONG!!!!

Connecticut is "the Yankee state" and has been since I don't know when,
certainly well before the George M. Cohan song was written.  Surely,
"Yankee Doodle" would have been the "unofficial" song of the state well in
advance of the Broadway song, since "Yankee Doodle" arrived on the hit
parade in 17-mumbledy-mump and "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" didn't get there
until 1918 or '20 or something.

(Just for the record, I don't believe the wooden nutmeg story at all.)

I'm proud to say that *my* state song is Hoagy Carmichael's "Georgia on my
Mind" made more famous than ever by my fellow Georgian (almost said "fellow
cracker") Bishop Ray Charles, who sang it in the state legislature.  Of
course, when  Hoagy wrote it, "Georgia" was a woman, not a state.

Actually, as recently as the early 70's there were Timber Rattlers
in southern NH.  When I was a young lass I spent several unhappy
summers at "Spruce Pond 4H Camp" in Bear Brook State Park.  We had
the pond, tannin filled and disgustingly clumpy like strong
tea with cream *and* lemon.  "They", the friendly rival "Bear Hill
4H Camp" had the distinction of having sighted rattlesnakes at least
once a year by reliable sources, more often by hysterical children.

Subj:   hamsters and sperm

I don't think this is for publication (it seems sort of stodgy to explain
strange things published in Desperado).

About that tabloid headline regarding what's-her-name's husband's sperm
and hamsters -- such tests are not the product of the writer's imagination.

There's a test called a "hamster egg test" that's used to determine
whether sperm can penetrate eggs.  Ovulation is induced in a hamster,
an ovum is "harvested" (presumably at the cost of the hamster's life,
although the term "harvested" is also used in regard to women undergoing
in vitro fertilization), and the ovum is put in a dish with the test subject's
sperm.  If the sperm penetrate the outer layers of the hamster egg, it's
likely that they'll penetrate a human egg.  The test costs a few hundred
dollars, which is not very expensive in the world of infertility medicine
(IVF costs several thousand dollars for each attempt).

To the best of my knowledge, a half-human, half-hamster has never resulted
from such a test.

    (I contemn Paul Shaffer.)

Does that mean "to condemn with contempt"?

"In whose eyes a vile person is contemned."
    -- Ps. xv. 4

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
It's an obsolescent word meaning to scorn, despise. or hold in contempt.
I'm on a one-man bandwagon (a vehicle neither fast nor reliable, but one
I'm accustomed to) to bring it back to life.

The jazzy modern Bible across the way has the verse as "Who despises a vile
man".  I suppose the nonsexist Bibles favored by feminists say "who
despises a vile man".

Although I said otherwise, the following was originally distributed via
Desperado long ago, before the numbering scheme, before the vertical bars,
before the =*= and even before the drip-drip-drip of the compiler's
comments.  So, here it is, as apt as ever, Leslie Wharton's immortal
"Digital Packages a Cake Mix".  (And thanks to all those who provided me
with copies.)
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

                           DIGITAL PACKAGES A CAKE MIX
                                        by
                                  Leslie Wharton

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Scenario:  DIGITAL decides  to  compete  with  Duncan  Hines  for  the
packaged cake mix market.

Survey  of  Competitive  Literature:   Duncan   Hines   includes   all
instructions  needed  to  create  the cake on the back of the package.
Instructions are simple:

      o  Dump the mix, one egg, and a half cup of water in a bowl

      o  Beat this mixture for 3 minutes

      o  Pour it into a 9 by 13 pan

      o  Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes

First draft:  Writer whips  together  one  page  of  instructions  for
making   cake.   (Writer  was  unable  to  test  instructions  because
prototype mix was not yet available;  however, that is never an excuse
for slipping schedule.)

Technical Review:  Development returns draft  with  copious  comments.
After conference with developers, writer discovers that DIGITAL's cake
mix is much more than a cake mix;  it's a veritable bakery in a box.

There are at least three different ways cooks can use  it  to  make  a
cake.   Adding the egg is an optional step.  (One of the developers is
a  backpacking  enthusiast.   He  theorized  that  deleting  the   egg
requirement  would  increase  the customer base to include campers and
those on low cholesterol diets.) However, if the egg is omitted, cooks
must increase the water to 3/4 cup.

Cooks can  also  improve  the  taste  of  the  cake  by  adding  three
tablespoons  of  oil.  However, if the cooks add oil, they must reduce
the water to 1/4 cup and cut the egg in half.

The temperature at which the cake must bake depends on the  choice  of
ingredients  added  to  the mix and also on the oven used by the cook.
(DIGITAL manufactures three types of ovens;  therefore, cooks must  be
able  to  bake  the cake in any of these.  Oven number three is a real
antique  and  slated  for  retirement  in  a   year.    Unfortunately,
instructions  for  oven  number three must be included because DIGITAL
still supports it.)

Second Draft:  This  draft  is  three  pages  of  dense  instructions.
Writer  attempts to lighten the impact with conversational tone, color
coding and bulleted lists.  Editor and  production  staff  go  bananas
trying  to  figure out how to package instructions with the box of mix
(forget about fitting them on the wrapper).  Final decision is to  ram
the pamphlet in the box with the mix and include a To the Cook note on
the back of the package to let cooks know where the instructions are.

Field Test:  Sites rave about the  cake  mix  and  its  documentation.
Several  insist  on  knowing  how  to use the mix to make brownies and
chocolate cookies.  (Writer adds these instructions, but wonders  just
how  many  cooks  will  be  using  the mix to make anything other than
cakes.  Development insists that cooks  want  freedom  of  choice  and
fears SPRs if customers discover undocumented ways to use the mix.)

Sign Off Draft:  Development informs writer that instructions must  be
included  for the microwave oven DIGITAL has just readied for release.
(Writer giggles and adds Appendix A, Microwave Notes.)

Post Release:

Case 1:  Cake mix does not sell as well as everyone expected.

The cake produced with the DIGITAL mix is far superior in taste to the
Duncan  Hines  mix.   Everybody  agrees  on  that  point.  The obvious
difference between  the  two  products  is  the  instruction  package.
Therefore, the problem is a documentation problem.  Now if DIGITAL can
only get those verbose writers to create smaller books....

Case 2:  The cake mix sells far better than anyone expected.

The cake produced with the DIGITAL mix is far superior in taste to the
Duncan Hines mix.  Customers love it;  however, they inundate software
support and  development  with  many  questions  about  the  cake-  vs
brownie-  vs  cookie-making process.  There are also many requests for
faster  baking  time  and  methods  to  optimize   oven   performance.
Simultaneously,  customers  complain that the mix instructions are too
difficult to understand and do not cover all  cake  mix  applications.
("I simply must add nuts and raisins, but when I do, the cake fails to
rise.  Please explain.")

As a result, the next version of the cake mix goes  out  with  a  five
pound  tome  that doubles the cost of the mix.  Now customers complain
that:  the mix costs too much, their recipe stands cannot support  the
weight  of  the instructions, and they do not like cross references to
oven documentation.  Some customers, software support  personnel,  and
sales people point out that Duncan Hines fit all cake mix instructions
on the back of the package.  Therefore, the problem is a documentation
problem.   Now if DIGITAL can only get those verbose writers to create
smaller books....

Moral (take your pick):

You can't have your cake and eat it, too.

Ease of use goes down as complexity goes up.

Too many cooks spoil the broth.

A product cannot accommodate everyone's "gut feelings."

"Gut feelings" should be based on marketing data.

Five fanatic customers can generate 500 SPRs that have no meaning  for
the other 20,000 customers.

The game of slap jack can be explained in one paragraph;  the game  of
chess  cannot.   (Has anyone suggested that a chess game could be made
easier to master by providing fewer instructions?)

Writing for DIGITAL can be hazardous to your sanity.

 Viri - Pose small risk
        {The Wall Street Journal, 15-Aug-90, p. B1}
   "Every time I start advising a company, I have to spend the first few days
 disabusing them of the notion that viruses are their biggest problem," gripes
 Robert Courtney, a computer consultant based in Port Ewen, N.Y. Mr. Courtney
 and others say outsiders account for only about 3% of data-security losses,
 measured in dollars. And virus-writers are only a portion of those outsiders.
 That pales beside the whopping 50%-65% most experts say is lost through
 avoidable mistakes, such as clerks keying in the wrong account number without
 being prompted to double-check entries. Along with power failures, another
 underestimated security problem, according to Mr. Courtney, is water. "Leaking
 roofs do three times as much damage to computer data as all the virus writers
 in the world put together," he says. "But people don't want to hear that. They
 like their problems to be intellectually titillating; they don't want to deal
 with dumb clerks and broken pipes." Even in the category of outright computer
 crime, estimated to cost U.S. companies about $1 billion a year, viruses come
 low on the totem pole. "In relation to all other problems, I'd have to say
 it's at the bottom," says Ronald Keelan, a former IBM security expert who
 works as a consultant in Larchmont, N.Y. Mr. Keelan says most computer crime
 can be stymied by screening personnel and restricting access to computers,
 since disgruntled and dishonest employees are the main culprits. Guarding
 against viruses is a good idea, he says, but it shouldn't detract from more
 basic issues: "That's like building a house, installing a fancy burglar alarm,
 and then leaving a big hole in the wall." (One exception to this rule, he
 notes, is university campuses, where computer viruses have become the most
 serious data-security problem.) Not everyone agrees that viruses have been
 blown out of proportion. "It causes more damage than any other security
 problem," asserts John McAfee of McAfee Associates, an anti-virus software and
 consulting company in Santa Clara, Calif. "Anyone who says it's lower priority
 just hasn't been hit yet." Mr. McAfee takes issue with the statistics cited by
 most consultants, saying the vast majority of virus damage goes unreported.
 Though he won't name names, he says he knows of several big corporations that
 have lost "tens of millions of dollars" because of virus attacks, which he
 says are proliferating. "This is something no one talks about," he says. "I've
 never had a client who had any interest whatsoever in publicity about his
 company's problems." But most experts, while agreeing that many companies
 probably hush up virus attacks, contend that only a negligent company could
 lose a large amount of data to a virus. "It's an inconvenience, not a large
 monetary or data loss," says Bill Vance, director of secure systems for IBM.
 Clifford Stoll, who recounted his battles with a computer "hacker" in a recent
 bestselling book, agrees: "The main thing spread by viruses is paranoia."

VNS TECHNOLOGY WATCH:                           [Mike Taylor, VNS Correspondent]
=====================                           [Nashua, NH, USA               ]

 The man who defies gravity (and scientists, and skeptics, and Newton)

 Scotland to Sydney in 17 minutes ? Mars in 1= days ? It could happen
 thanks to the engineer Sandy Kidd's anti-gravity invention. Stuart
 Bathgate meets the man who British Aerospace are at last taking seriously.

 In 1903 the eminent American astronomer Simon Newcomb "proved" on paper
 that heavier-than-air flight was a mathematical impossibility. Later that
 year the Wright brothers flew a Kitty Hawk.

 This gap between accepted scientific theory and reality is all too
 familiar to Dundee-based engineer Sandy Kidd. In a book published this
 week, Beyond 2001, Kidd provides a fascinating account of the process that
 eventually led to his producing a self-propelling giroscopic device - the
 Kidd machine - which, it is said, will revolutionize the laws of physics.
 In particular, Kidd's claims that Newton's Laws of Motion - sacrosanct for
 centuries - do not hold true for all instances.

 The machine's value though, is not just theoretical. Employing constant
 acceleration, it could shrink the solar system. Traveling to Mars would
 take a day and a half. Neptune - some seven years distant by rocket -
 would be reached in under a fortnight. Distances on Earth too, could
 become meaningless: instead of commuting by rail from, say Linlithgow to
 Edinburgh, a journey of 15 minutes, the owner of a Kidd machine could
 travel to work daily from Sydney - it would only take two minutes longer.

 All this is possible because of what is known as 'anti-Newtonian lift'.

 The classical physics dictum that "every action must have an equal and
 opposite reaction" is observable in everyday life: you can only jump into
 the air by first pushing down on the ground; a rocket can escape our
 atmosphere only by producing a phenomenal thrust. Yet Kidd's machine does
 not require thrust to lift itself into the air. It is not lifted by
 aerodynamics. It does not depend on a hot-air cushion. Incredible as it
 sounds, Kidd's machine rises by losing weight.

 "Taking angular momentum and turning it into linear momentum without a
 reaction is just not allowed," says Kidd - "but that's what my machine
 does."

 Needles to say, since that night in 1984 when he first got the machine to
 work in his own garage on the outskirts of Dundee, reaction from the
 academic world has been almost universally hostile. At first, the tactic
 was to laugh it off, with the claim that Kidd was spinning a yarn, not a
 giroscope. Then, various, increasingly desperate, attempts were made to
 prove that Kidd's device, did, after all, conform to the known laws of
 physics. None of them have been successful.

 Now, six years on, with the publication of 'Beyond 2001', and of an
 independent laboratory report on his machine, Kidd says that it is time
 for the academics to put up or shut up. "They just want to think that if
 they jump up and down and tear their hair out I'll admit I'm a liar. A lot
 of them are like children when you've taken away their toys. It really
 gets to them. How can this unqualified nitwit make this machine?"

 It's a refreshingly honest self-description. Kidd realizes all too well
 the apparent uncertainty of the situation: an engineer with no academic
 training potters about in his shed, cannibalizing washing machines and
 lawn-mowers for spare parts until he stands accepted physics on its head.

 His interest in the entire project began, he says, in the air force.
 "There were a lot of times with nothing to do, times of boredom when you
 just lie in your pit and ask 'Who am I? Why am I here?' - all these
 two-steps-to-the-loony-bin questions. So you had to find some other
 interest. In my case, I honestly believed that man would find an
 alternative means of space travel."

 It was the very fact that Kidd had not been 'brainwashed', as he puts it,
 by an academic training, that led him to ask the right questions in the
 first place. He also has an implicit awareness of the importance of the
 old saying, that the greatest wisdom of all is to appreciate the depth of
 your own ignorance.

 "When I hear scientists say we know all there is to know about the laws of
 physics it annoys me. How can they be so arrogant? We don't have a clue.
 Nobody's ever seen an electron. We don't know what gravity is. We don't
 know what inertia is. We only scratch the surface"

 Events have moved on apace since the successful lab tests with which the
 book concludes. Whereas previously Kidd had achieved the lifting effect
 without knowing how strong that effect could become, in the last six
 months, he says, "I have proved it can be as good as you want it to be.
 It's only limited to the strength of the material."

 Of equal importance is the fact that he now knows why the machine works -
 not only because it will help to make technical advances, but also
 because his wife Janet - "I couldn't have done any of this without her" -
 is threatening to leave him if he doesn't stop constructing new, improved
 models. "She said that years ago," says Kidd, trying to laugh off his
 wife's assertion. "Aye, but I mean it this time," she replies.

 The Kidd machine works for reasons entirely different to those he first
 thought of, although clearly, with the enormous potential involved, he is
 not about to divulge those reasons to the general public. "Let's just say
 that a physicist or mathematician who isn't brainwashed or hidebound will
 be able to look at the machine and accept that my explanation for why it
 works is correct."

 If anyone is still skeptical, Kidd is willing to stake more than personal
 pride on the veracity of his claims. "I'm prepared to bet my house against
 their house," he says. "All those academics can take me up on that if they
 still refuse to believe me. They'll be furious when the book comes out -
 and the more fury the book raises, the happier I'll be - but I doubt if
 any of them will take me up on that bet."

 There is a theory of scientific advancement known as "steam-kettle time"
 which asserts that once the conditions are right, a certain invention is
 more or less inevitable.

 Scattered around Europe and North America are dozens of people working
 independently on the same project. At least two others, Kidd thinks, have
 achieved anti-Newtonian lift. "A lot of people have been working on
 'anti-gravity devices' for the same reason as me," he says. "The rocket is
 a crude, inefficient, dangerous device. There has to be a better way."

 Now the timescale for commercial development of that better way is
 'directly proportional to wallet - it all depends on how much money
 someone is willing to put into it." While it was announced yesterday that
 British Aerospace will help fund further tests, the Australian company BWN
 with whom Kidd has worked for several years will retain a keen interest in
 the device's development: the engineer will soon return to Australia, with
 his wife, to supervise more research.

 Kidd's device, then, is an idea whose time has come. And, one might say
 paradoxically, not before time. Anyone who struggles for so many years to
 achieve what is said to be impossible, who perseveres despite the diverse
 difficulties detailed in Beyond 2001, must either be mad, or know that he
 is right. Sandy Kidd is not mad. Very soon now the final verdict will be
 delivered.

Subject: Getting Stoned by Telephone
From: Dolf Grunbauer &lt;dolf@idca.tds.philips.nl&gt;

Patrick,

A couple of weeks ago the following article was published in one of
our newspapers: "De Volkskrant", in the column "Dag In, Dag Uit".
Here is my translation of the article:

Telefonica, the Spanish telephone company, was astonished. "Stoned by
sniffing our telephones? Is that possible? Please don't spread it
around! Otherwise no telephone booth will survive", a spokesman begged
in vain. Spain's Conservative Party will make some questions about
this telephone sniffing in the Parliament.

The rumour started in Granada. A local newspaper stated that drug
adicts were responsible for the sharp increase of vandalism of public
telephone booths. A telephone technician said "They break the hearing
part out of the telephone and burn the parts because the smoke has a
narcotic influance with which they get stoned."  His bosses immediately
denied it and did counter research. This revealed that no "strange
parts" were used in the telephone making.

Still the rumour was all around Spain. The PTT acknowledges the
increase of repairs of telephone booths. The police thinks that the
rumour has started due to the fact that in Granada an old fashioned
glue was used to glue the telephone horns together. So it is a variant
on the old glue sniffing.  No one has been able to prove that Spanish
youngsters did get stoned due to the Spanish PTT, like the Spanish
opposition keeps on claiming.  The Spanish people will desperatly have
to search for an undamaged telephone booth as long as the rage of the
telephone sniffers lasts.

Subj:   women workplace casualty story

ATLANTA (AP) -- The leading killer of American women in the workplace
isn't crashed or fire.  It's homicide.

The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that 42% of the
on-the-job injury deaths of women in the US from 1980 to 1985 were
homicides.

Second was vehicle accidents, at around 39%, said Catherine Bell, and
epidemiologist with the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health.

"If a woman's going to die from an injury at work, she's probably going
to be murdered", Bell said.

NIOSH investigators identified 950 female occupational homicides over the
6 year period.  Of that number 389 - 41% - worked in the retail field.

Researchers aren't certain, but it appears that strangers in the store --
not co-workers -- are responsible for the most workplace killings of
women, Bell said.

Nationwide, for both sexes, about 13% of the on-the-job injury deaths
during 1980-85 were homicides, the CDC reported.  Homicides accounted for
12% of the men's occupational fatalities, compared with the 42% for women.

&gt;From 8/18/90 New York Times, from AP source:

YAKIMA, Wash., Aug. 17 (AP)
Crew members of a commuter plane that crashed last year,
killing all six people aboard, used credit cards to scrape
ice from the wings and propellers and declined de-icing
equipment at least twice, investigators say.
   The report by the National Transportation Safety Board
offered no conclusions about the cause of the crash on
Dec. 26, said Eric Sager of the safety board, who wrote the
report.
   "It's one small part of the investigation," Mr. Sager said
Thursday in a telephone interview.  "That information may or
may not end up in the report."  A final report will be issued
in several weeks.
   Mr. Sager said he did not think it was unusual that the
co-pilot and another United Express crew member used credit
cards to remove ice from the 19-passenger British Aerospace
Jetstream 31 turboprop during the stop in Yakima.
   "Ice is very frequent," Mr. Sager said.  "They were attending
to it."
   The employees were looking at the wings and presumably felt
that the buildup was not enough to warrant the use of de-icing
equipment, he said.
   But a United Express agent in Yakima told investigators she
was surprised that the captain had chosen not to de-ice, since
most other planes were undergoing the five-minute procedure.

--------------- The Burroughs/Sperry (now Unisys) Merger Song -----------

              (to the tune of the "Battle Hymn of the Republic")

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the merger come to pass.
  It has taken two expanding firms and knocked them on their a--.
It has given all the customers heartburn and lots of gas.
  And the stocks started going down.

Glory, glory, what a merger.
Glory, glory, what a merger.
Glory, glory, what a merger.
And the stocks keep going down.

I have seen the speculation of the great things yet to come.
  Like software without source code that will never fail to run.
And promises of hardware where our real work can get done.
  But the stocks keep going down.

They have bet the ranch on Unix as the future's tidal wave.
  And they're counting on the Unix sales to try to help them save,
Their relationship with Wall Street where investors won't behave.
  And the stocks keep going down.

I have seen the teams of experts crawling all around our site.
  With assurances that they will fix the things that aren't quite right.
And it only took them half a year to straighten out our plight.
  But the stocks keep going down.

I have seen them lay off thousands just to "turn the ship around"
  But they kept the chief executive and rumors did abound.
And the crew below the decks could hear the waters gurgling sound.
  And the stocks kept going down.

Perhaps this year their factories will get stuff off the line.
  And perhaps the distribution group will ship it out on time.
And perhaps the stuff will really work when we bring it all online.
  Or the stocks will still go down.

And now the architect who brought this wonderous thing about.
  Has moved into the banking world, where without a doubt
He will give the financiers good cause to dance and sing and shout,
  As the stocks keep going down.

So now lets toast Jim Unruh and award him our respect.
  And hope that he is not the captain standing on the deck
Of the ship called the Titanic, just before its icy wreck.
  Or we'll all be going down.

Well, I guess it's clear that there is really nothing more to say.
  Except we hope this company is facing brighter days.
So let's get our buts in gear, and update our resumes.
  As the stocks keep going down.

        your passage, tootle him with vigor, express by word of mouth the
        warning "hi-hi".

4.      Beware the wandering horse that he shall not take fright as you pass
        him by.  Do not explode the exhaust box at him as pass him by.  Go
        soothingly by.

5.      Give big space to the festive dog that shall sport in the roadway.

6.      Go soothingly in the grease mud, as there lurks the skid demon.

8.      Press the braking of the foot as you roll round the corner to

        TRACY, Calif. (UPI) -- Jumping from a hot air balloon 150 feet in
the sky with an elastic cord attached to a harness around your middle is
an unforgettable adrenaline rush.
        The world's first commercial hot air balloon bungee jumpers, some
60 thrill seekers who recently gathered in a northern California cow
pasture, say the same.
        They came from cities across the country to pay the Palo Alto-based
Bungee Adventure company $99 for one jump and a video record of the
feat.
        Todd Newton, 21, a Richmond, Calif., security guard became the
first recorded paying customer to make a bungee jump from a hot air
balloon at daybreak on May 5.
        "Are you scared?" ground supporters called up to him while the
green, yellow, black, red and orange balloon ascended.
        "Yeah," he said.
        The group on the ground began chanting, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1!"
        Prompted by the countdown, Newton hurled himself into space.
        "Yeeehaa!" he screamed, dangling triumphant from the cord seconds
later. "I'm a born bungee baby!"
        "We've got a satisified yo-yo," said a beaming John Kockelman,
30, who founded Bungee Adventure along with his brother, Pete, 28.
        After the lunge Earthward, the jumper is lowered to the ground.
        The Kockelmans, leaders among pioneer bungee jumpers, got into the
sport in October 1987, doing it for fun in the beginning from bridges,
buildings, giant cranes and redwood trees.
        Bungee jumping hot spots also can be found in New Zealand where a
group has conducted some 23,000 jumps off bridges, and in France, where
two thrill seekers fell to their deaths last year.
        The Kockelmans went commercial in May 1988 and have supervised over
9,000 bungee jumps off bridges.
        "We were looking for a better platform when we hit upon the idea
of jumping from a hot air balloon," John said.
        Pete obtained a pilot's license and the brothers invested in a
$20,000 balloon, then added another $10,000 in special reinforcing
safety features needed for bungee jumping.
        "No one else in the entire world is doing hot air balloon bungee
jumping commercially," John says.
        With very little advertising, the Kockelman's balloon is already
booked into July.
        What does it feel like to leap from a hot air balloon?
        My jump, known as "The Flight of the Pudgy Eagle," found some
answers.
        I can report that first comes terror -- during that finite moment
your weight shifts forward, away from the swaying balloon basket -- as
every nerve in your body screams, "Don't do this!"
        Seconds after the inexorable plunge toward hostile earth, terror
gives way to the giggles as the jumper hits the end of his 43-foot-long
bungee cord and it stretches, slowing that awful fall and doubling to 86
feet in length.
        Next comes a whacking great rebound -- boing-g-g-g, and another,
boing-g-g-g -- high above terra firma.
        The giggles are nearly unstoppable as you bob up down like a human
yo-yo.
        Brad Buller, 26, a carpenter from Santa Cruz, knows.
        "I'm sick. No way am I doing this," he said.
        But moments later Buller was in the specially reinforced balloon
basket.
        "Think ground rush, Brad," called out pilot Pete Kockelman -- and
Buller takes the plunge.
        "Total helplessness," he said. "Wow! I want to go again. Oh
yeah! Yeah! Major acceleration. This is so hot!"
        Cedric Mallinckrodt, 26, a Los Altos research engineer, eyed an
arm-frailing leaper and muttered, "That's sincerely stupid. Great. I
mean that's my style. I'm next."
        Dawn Mikkelson, 33, a marriage and family counselor from San Jose
became the first woman commercial bungee jumper from a hot air balloon.
        "It was scary at first," she said. "I had trouble getting a good
solid breath and then I was just bouncing off -- it was so cool."
        Steve Wylmz, 38, a Santa Monica, songwriter came along because,
"It seemed a really edgy thing to do -- pretty wild."
        "We're gonna let you peel off and go for some big air," Pete
Kockelman shouts. Moments later Wylmz is jouncing at the end of the
inch-thick bungee cord, laughing and giggling.
        "Turbo," says Wylmz.
        "I've wanted to bungee jump for a while," said John Martens, 24,
an electrical engineer from Madison, Wis. "This is the only place I
could find to do it.
        "It's the most intense rush. It's short-lived but intense."
        Stan Thomas, a softwear company salesman from Portola Valley said
of his bungee jump: "You're 120 feet off the ground. Then you figure,
`I might as well jump, everybody's watching me.' I'd do it again in a
second."
        "Big air!" shouted Pete Kockelman from above. "We're not
joking!"

DRUNKEN REVELLER ASSAULTED CAT

A FEAT which had been thought impossible--to make a journey on public transport
at Christmas time more disgusting--has been achieved by John Smith, a London
Transport labourer, who was fined 500 pounds at the Old Bailey yesterday
for publicly and indecently assaulting a cat on a Tube train, writes Andrew
Brown.

Warwick McKinnon, for the prosecution, said that four days before last
Christmas, Smith was seen on a train with his trousers around his knees,
rubbing himself against a grey-brown cat he was holding on his lap.

A woman passenger was so disgusted she immediately left the train; Smith
put the cat down and pulled up his trousers.  The cat walked off along
the platform and disappeared, while station staff, who had also seen
what happened, called the police and took Smith to the station office.

When questioned by the police he said, and repeated to the jury, that he had
fallen asleep after drinking 10 pints of beer and some spirits to celebrate
Christmas, and was dead to the world until woken by people shouting at him
about a cat.  "What cat?", he had asked the police.

He was charged with the common law offence of "committing an act of lewd,
obscene and disgusting nature and outraging public decency by behaving in
an indecent manner with a cat to the great disgust and annoyance of diverse
of Her Majesty's subjects within whose purview such an act was committed".

Stella Reynolds, for Smith, 32, of White City Estate, west London, told an
Old Bailey court: "There have been cases involving dogs, horses, sheep, and
pigs but there has never been a case involving a cat."

After the verdict Miss Reynolds said Smith would almost certainly lose his
job because he "could not cope with the constant stream of jokes directed at
him".

Headline:        MAD CONFIDENCE DISEASE STRIKES WHIZZ-KIDS

Thousands of high-fliers in the financial and business worlds are suffering
from "really useful syndrome," a senior clinical psychologist has found. They
have fallen into a state of mind which he calls "assumed usefulness."  The
main symptom is unwarranted self-confidence.  There is no instant cure.

Paul Whitby, senior clinical psychologist at Tonna Hospital, West Glamorgan,
has pinpointed other symptoms, including high self-esteem and a behaviour
pattern of persistent activity and enthusiasm fostered by the occasional and
random reward of a good profit which arrives independently of the person's
efforts.  The dominating emotional state of people suffering the condition is
their conviction that what they are doing is really useful.  Dr. Whitby says
the phenomenon of unwarranted self-confidence is not restricted to people in
commerce.  The implications could be even more serious when it afflicted
those working in other fields.

He explains his ideas in the latest issue of the Psychologist, the monthly
bulletin of the British Psychological Society, published today [7/2/90]. His
article carries a warning for psychotherapists.  He suggests that they and
other physicians who tend to blame patients for the failure of therapies are
probably suffering from the "assumed usefulness" syndrome themselves. Dr.
Whitby says that where a depressed patent thinks "I am responsible for all
bad things and failures,"  a mistakenly self-confident therapist has a frame
of mind that believes "I am responsible for all good things, improvements and
cures."  Whereas depressed people are likely to see any performance which
falls short of perfection as abject failure, the self-confident
psychotherapist may see any performance which falls short of complete failure
as satisfactory.

Dr. Whitby suggests that his idea of assumed usefulness can be employed to
analyze the thoughts and behaviour of psychotherapists in the type of study
that has mostly been applied to examining the condition of the patients
suffering personality disorders and neuroses.  He has conceived the notion
in an effort to resolve a controversy over the effectiveness of
psychotherapy.  He says, "Without a twinge of embarrassment nurses, doctors,
psychologists, social workers and others describe themselves as
psychotherapists." Yet, judged on any objective criteria of the available
research, the psychotherapies were not even moderately successful.  "If
psychotherapy is so effective, then sensible people would not practise it,
but they do."

Dr. Whitby's approach should reveal which psychotherapists suffer the assumed
usefulness syndrome.

[Let's hope it can be extended to the technical  community soon.]

Subj:   Where is Robert Mapplethorpe When You Need Him?

I got this mail message the day after I saw the Mapplethorpe exhibit.
Sounds like the Astoreka brothers could have been interesting models
for his photographs.  Anyway, I thought this might be a candidate for
submission to Desperado.

Hope you're doing well.

[] Not in the olympics yet...
   A Spaniard has just won a nutcracking contest by cracking 30 walnuts
  between his buttocks in less than a minute. Hundreds of spectators
  watched Jose Luis Astoreka, 34, squat to victory in the first annual
  "nutcracking with the bottom championships" at the annual festival in the
  Basque village of Kortezubi, 199 miles from Madrid. Mr Astoreka cracked
  the walnuts laid out on the ground in two rows in 57 seconds. His
  brother, Juan Ramon, was second with a time of 1min 20 seconds. The
  brothers winning times have been attributed to "a peculiar physical
  characteristic which runs in the Astoreka family. {The Independent}

Tom, dimly through my trusty earplugs and the yowls of Horsa this morning,
I heard a song that made me think of you, especially the line "If you got
a black list, I wanna be on it." Singer's Billy Bragg, with a working class
accent and an Attitude, song was "Waiting for the Great Leap Forward", album
is Workers' Playtime. The rest is up to you!

Love and kisses,

                     SOLDIER'S MANUAL OF COMMON TASKS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        There's a general impression that soldiers are morons, with
        generals the most moronic and privates next most moronic.  I can't
        speak for the generals, but I've been reading a 536-page
        description of some 80 complex tasks that every private is expected
        to master.  Every soldier -- Regular Army, National Guard, Reserve
        -- is grilled quarterly on this stuff.

        The first thing in the book:

                            COLLECT/REPORT INFORMATION

        "Given a tactical situation that includes any number of enemy
        soldiers, engaged in any type of activity, who can be seen either
        with the naked eye or with binoculars, make a complete and accurate
        oral or written report to your leader that describes the size,
        activity, location, unit, time, and equipment observed."

        The tests for this are pretty easy to imagine.

        Not so for the last thing in the book:

                       CONDUCT COMBAT OPERATIONS ACCORDING
                                TO THE LAW OF WAR

        "Given a combat situation and you are faced with --
        1. Enemy troops, equipment, material, and supplies.
        2. Inhabited towns and cities.
        3. Protected property (hospitals, museums, schools, churches).
        4. Civilians and private property.
        5. Sick and wounded captives and detainees.
        6. Surrendering enemy troops.
        7. Observing a member of your force about to perform an illegal
        action.
        8. Receiving and order to perform an illegal action.
        9. Being captured by the enemy and held as a prisoner of war.

        "Show that you can
        1. Perform combat operations using lawful weapons and tactics, and
        engaging only lawful targets.
        2, Treat all captives, civilians, and their propoerty according to
        the law of war.
        3. Take appropriate action when faced with violations of the law of
        war, or illgal orders.
        4. Identify your rights and duties as a prisoner of war."

        Passing this test can get pretty hairy.  Things we don't allow our
        soldiers to do:

                no dumdum bullets, poison, poisoned ammunition, no faking
                surrender, no using enemy vehicles or uniforms, no
                booby-trapping dead or wounded, no hiding behind Red Cross,
                Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun, and Red Shield of David
                markings, no unjustified attacks or needless destruction of
                undefended civilian buildings, particularly churches,
                museums, and schools, no killing people trying to
                surrender, no torture or sexual abuse of prisoners, food,
                water, shelter, medical treatment and a trip out of the
                combat zone are rights of prisoners, no physical force or
                mental coercian of civilians, no enforced prostitution,
                rape, or sexual assault of women, no collective reprisals
                or taking of hostages, no stealing civilian or military
                supplies that have no intelligence value.

        Now granted, when they're shooting at you, lots of bad things gain
        in appeal.  In particular, I remember the My Lai massacre and the
        destruction of the Abbey of Monte Cassino.  I even think it's
        likely that the way things got on this list of prohibitions is that
        some American soldier did them and got caught doing it, but I also
        know there's many an army where these sort of things are required
        or expected, not prohibited.

        In between these two tasks are 78 other things we expect our
        soldiers to know how to do, from reading a map and estimating
        distances to creeping across open country with someone shooting at
        you, to ahooting down an aircraft with small arms, to 17 specific
        items of first aid (at least 14 of them pretty gruesome), to how to
        "locate mines by probing", to camouflage, to 18 tasks relating to
        nuclear, biological and chemical contamination, including the
        amazing difficulties of the 23-step process of using the latrine
        while in an anti-nuclear-biological-chemical suit.  (In the strange
        language of the army, this is called  MOPP (mission-oriented
        protective posture) gear.)

        Another section deals with identifying 34 different "friendly and
        threat" armored vehicles.  They don't say which are which, and that
        should be handy in Saudi Arabia, where erstwhile "ally" Iraq is
        running all sorts of "friendly" tanks against us and our erstwhile
        enemies are lined up next to us running all sorts of "threat" tanks
        at the Iraqis.

        So, where is this all leading?  To a few more random comments, I
        guess.  It's fascinating to see what a sophisticated business being
        a US soldier in the 90s turns out to be.  Its fascinating to see
        our civilian values so strongly stressed in military doctrine, not
        just in the stuff about treatment of prisoners and civilians, but
        in the stuff about how to give first aid to your buddy when she's
        been gassed, not to mention the good-old gadgety technology feel of
        the whole thing.

        It's a scary book, real practical technical writing, and American
        all the way through.  It ain't easy being Army green.

                                    =*=

        That's all for today.  I hope this reaches you in a peaceful world.
