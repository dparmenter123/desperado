I recently made a flying visit to Washington D.C. to make the acquaintance
of Miss Ruth Jackson Steinhardt, the newest blossom on the family tree,
and excessively adorable she is, too. While there, my dear brother, the
father of this cherub, told me the latest Washington joke:

What's the difference between Nancy Reagan and the Panama Canal?
The Panama Canal is a busy ditch.

He also reported to me an outstanding bumper sticker:

SHOP TIL YOU DROP

and I saw, on a BMW, another:

Subj:   Nuclear Attacks in #1112

The comments in Desperado about the targeting of the Hot Dog Stand in
the Pentagon reminded me of some work I did years ago for the Navy in
Washington...

We were building this massive Personel Data system for the Navy in the
"Navy Annex" which is on a hill overlooking the Pentagon. Well, one day
the Navy Contracts officer got very upset with us because we hadn't
specified a "Nuclear Event Contingency Plan"... They wanted us to
stockpile food in the basement for our workers and have a bunch of
battery operated microfilm readers on hand in case a nuclear attack wiped
out the local power plant... About every 5 minutes during the meeting
with the Contracts officer, someone would point out the window to the
Pentagon at the bottom of the hill and say: "Do you really mean we need to
plan what to do AFTER the bomb hits THAT building???". The Navy never really
got the point... We put food rations in the basement and got lots of battery
powered microfilm readers. Your tax dollars at work...

              THE TRAVELING PRESIDENT PROBLEM

                       Tod Malmedy

We present a new variation of the traveling salesman problem.
There are two differences.  First, the links are free but the
nodes, representing memorials, have either small positive or
large negative weights, and the goal is to maximize this
weight.  Second, unlike most problems, in which a solver is
allowed to exhaustively search the space of combinations for an
optimal solution, in this variation the value of the final
solution is penalized by the number of combinations tested
before finding it.  Under these conditions the L/D (Leave it
to Deaver) strategy can be proven to be the worst possible.

News Flash: President Reagan announced today the cancellation of
his planned stop at the German military cemetery in Bitburg.
"When my advisors suggested a visit to Bitburg, I thought they
said Pittsburgh. I just couldn't understand what all the fuss

Subj:   Welcome to the '80's

        We keep our radio tuned to WJUL, 91.5 on the FM dial, for most of our
radio needs.  However, being a college station and all, the DJs don't always
show up for the early morning shows.  So to make sure we wake up in the morn-
ing, we tweak our clock radio's dial up a tad.
        This usually gets us WBOS, which is 92.something_or_other.  It's a
country/western station.  Neither of us are avid country/western fans, so it
usually does get us up:  we rush to the radio and shut it off immediately.
        Anyways, last Wednesday, the radio sprung to life playing a song called
"To All the Girls I've Loved" (or something to that effect) by Julio Iglesias
and Willie Nelson.  It was too strange to turn off.  Imagine this:

Julio:  To alll de gorls I've lawved beforre...
Willie: Hew travul in an' out mah dore...

When the song was over, the DJ informed us that that song was going out to all
the secretaries since Wednesday was National Secretaries' Day.  He went on:
        "Ah don't know what we'd all do without ya.  Behind ever' successful
executive, therr's a purty gal.  I know we all sound like a buncha male chau-
vinist pigs sometime, but [pregnant pause] we love ya."
        Apparently this nod to the Women's Movement was overly controversial,
because the next song he played went something like "She keeps the home fires
burnin' while I'm out there earnin'...she keeps me happy so I come home..."

gy-ro-scope: A wheel or disk mounted to spin rapidly about an axis and
also free to rotate about one or both of two axes perpendicular to each
other and the axis of spin so that a rotation of one of the two
mutually perpendicular axes results from application of torque to the
other when the wheel is spinning and so that the entire apparatus
offers considerable opposition depending on the angular momentum to any
torque that would change the direction of the axis of spin.

I've built a better model than the one at Data General
For data bases vegetable, animal, and mineral
My OS handles CPUs with multiplexed duality;
My PL/1 compiler shows impressive functionality.
My storage system's better than magnetic core polarity,
You never have to bother checking out a bit for parity;
There isn't any reason to install non-static floor matting;
My disk drive has capacity for variable formatting.

CHO:  His disk drive has capacity for variable formatting,
      His disk drive has capacity for variable formatting,
      His disk drive has capacity for variable format-formatting.

I feel compelled to mention what I know to be a gloating point:
There's lots of room in memory for variables floating-point,
Which shows for input vegetable, animal, and mineral
I've built a better model than the one at Data General.

CHO:  Which shows for input vegetable, animal, and mineral
      He's built a better model than the one at Data General.

The IBM new home computer's nothing more than germinal;
At Prime they still have trouble with an interactive terminal;
While Tandy's done a lousy job with operations Boolean,
At Wang the byte capacity's too small to fit a coolie in.
Intel's mid-year finances are something of the trouble sort;
The Timex Sinclair crashes when you implement a bubble sort.
All DEC investors soon will find they haven't spent their money well;
And need I even mention Nixdorf, Univac, or Honeywell?

CHO:  And need he even mention Nixdorf, Univac, or Honeywell?
      And need he even mention Nixdorf, Univac, or Honeywell?
      And need he even mention Nixdorf, Univac, or Honey-Honeywell?

By striving to eliminate all source code that's repetitive
I've brought my benchmark standings to results that are competitive.
In short, for input vegetable, animal, and mineral
I've built a better model than the one at Data General.

CHO:  In short for input vegetable, animal, and mineral
      He's built a better model than the one at Data General.

In fact when I've a floppy of a maximum diameter,
When I can call a subroutine of infinite parameter,
When I can point to registers and keep their current map around,
And when I can prevent the need for mystifying wraparound,
When I can update record blocks with minimum of suffering,
And when I can afford to use a hundred K for buffering,
When I've performed a matrix sort and tested the addition rate,
You'll marvel at the speed of my asynchronous transmission rate.

CHO:  You'll marvel at the speed of his asynchronous transmission rate,
      You'll marvel at the speed of his asynchronous transmission rate,
      You'll marvel at the speed of his asynchronous transmission-mission rate.

Though all my better programs that self-reference recursively
Have only been obtained through expert spying, done subversively,
But still for input vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I've built a better model than the one at Data General.

      He's built a better model than the one at Data General.

As long as we're talking about Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, which is being
broadcast on the Primarily British System, I want to ask if
people are watching the new set of episodes on the PBS show Mystery! It's
a dramatization of the Wilkie Collins melodrama The Woman in White. This is
a very famous novel, with three supremely interesting characters in it, two of
which appeared in the first episode: the heroine, Marian Halcombe, a strong
and intelligent woman who is, in the novel, described as very ugly, being
in particular disfigured by her eyebrows. The irony is that the actress playing
her is Diana Quick, who played Julia Flyte in Brideshead Revisited, where
she was considered a raving beauty. Autre temps, autre moeurs, I guess. Then
there's the supreme villain Count Fosco, who hasn't appeared yet, and Mr.
Frederick (not a hairdresser) who is Marian's cousin and
a neurasthenic. This is a Victorian malady that none of us have time to suffer
from anymore. It's what happens when your sensibilities are so finely tuned
that normal stimuli are torture to you. Roderick Usher suffered from it in
the Poe short story. Mr. Frederick sits all day in a darkened room and entreats
his visitors not to slam the curtains. My husband says it comes from living a
sensorily deprived life, exacerbated by poor nutrition, and no sunshine or
fresh air or exercise. Lots of Victorian maladies could be ascribed to these
causes, like the vapors and green sickness, a disease of young ladies
who turned green from anemia.

       Professor Takes Comic Books Seriously: Donald Duck's On The
                                Curriculum

                           By ELIZABETH P. LATT
                         Associated Press Writer

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Donald Duck isn't just Mickey Mouse
stuff to a professor here.
   Vanderbilt University professor Donald Ault speaks of the man
who created the squawking character for Walt Disney with the same
reverence other English professors reserve for Dickens and
Shakespeare.
   Donald may be a quarrelsome, foul-tempered duck in the movies,
says Ault, but his character in comic books is ``incredibly
articulate,'' often philosophizing and providing the voice of
reason.
   He believes the Donald Duck comics are literary classics in the
same league with works by British poet William Blake. So he teaches
courses about both.
   His course about Donald's antics - ``Popular Narrative: Comics,
Film and Television'' - was offered to 70 students last fall. Ault,
42, will teach it again next spring.
   Donald's comic book adventures are regular classroom materials.
Some are moralistic - the unhappiness that comes when Donald looks
for a way to get rich without working. In others, he is the
gullible hero who triumphs over April Fool's jokes, backyard pests,
spies and rigged quiz shows.
   ``Anybody can identify with him,'' Ault said. ``Sometimes he
really comes out the hero, when you least expect it.''
   Ault, whose interest in comic books stayed with him from
childhood, praiss Carl Barks, the man who drew Donald for Disney
studios. The genius of Barks, who retired in 1966, was that he
``made Donald seem so real in a context that was so impossible,''
Ault said.
   He said fans pay up to $45,000 for oil paintings by Barks of
Donald and other Disney characters.
   Among those who have credited Barks with inspiring them are
movie makers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who wrote the
preface to a volume of Barks reprints.
   ``Carl Barks' world view involves poking fun at the
materialistic tendencies that all people have and praising their
more sociable, brotherly aspects,'' Lucas wrote.
   Since 1981, Barks' works have been republished in several
volumes. Ault wrote essays and provided material for the Carl Barks
Library of Donald Duck. Ault said he has found that reading comic
books enables students to ``activate those dormant parts of their
imagination'' and causes ``an interest in all sorts of cultural
phenomena.''
   ``If you just get into it ... and allow yourself to get into
tha world, it opens up all kinds of possibilities in how you
perceive things.''
