Subject: New enhancements to the IBM Personal Computer

According to the November 1982 issue of the newsletter of the
Greater Boston Chapter of the ACM, in a blurb signed by George Ballester:

        It is reported that IBM has the 370-on-a-chip as an add-on
        option for the IBM Personal Computer.  It is alleged that
        this would allow one to run mainframe operating systems, like
        MVS and VM, on a personal computer that could address up to
        16 Mbytes of virtual memory.

If this is true, the economics of the situation are intriguing.  You buy
an IBM PC for $5000.  You buy two very large disk drives (to hold the
mainframe software) for about $100,000.  You buy 15.75 megabytes of
memory (and a cabinet to hold them, along with power supplies, etc.) for
about $80,000.  You pay god knows how much (but more than $50,000) for
the software license.  Assume the 370 option for the PC has
negligible cost (silicon is cheap, right?).  Presumably, somebody
will build an interface to slow the disks and memory down so the PC can
handle it.  (I wonder if you need a card reader, and punch?)

Then again, maybe you just load the whole mess of a truckload of 5-1/4
inch floppies.

Subject: J11 rumors

A friend of mine works at Automatix, a local robotics firm that currently uses
68000s in their products.  They have done some testing on a J11 prototype, and
report some good news and some bad news.

The good news:  The J11 is six to eight times as fast as the 68000 in random,
mixed computation.  It is almost two orders of magnitude faster in floating
point calculations!

The bad news:  It will not execute every instruction it's supposed to.
There are problems either in the manufacturing process or in the
design of the chip which prevent some instructions from executing properly.

PS -

I did a little checking.  The guy at Automatix is a neighbor of a DEC guy who
is working on the J11.  The figures I gave you are based on unoffial info the
DEC guy gave out, augmented by data from the J11 data sheet that has already
been published.

Subject: Call letters

Although call letters for each country are established by the CCIR (the
International Radio Consultative Committee) (part of the ITU), in most
of the world they are not used by Broadcast Stations, but only by amateurs.

Most stations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia identify them-
selves by announcing their station name and location.  Most domestic
stations in North America and the Pacific (including Australia and New
Zealand) identify by using a callsign of 3 to 5 letters or a combination
of letters and numbers, of which the first one or two letters denote the
nationality of the station in accordance with the international system of
prefixes.  Most stations in Latin America use a callsign (often not freq-
uently announced), a station name or slogan, and location.

In addition, many stations (especially international ones) use interval
signals generally consisting of musical phrases repeated frequently before
sign-on and between programmes, to help listeners to find the station on
their receiver, and to identify it as the wanted station.

For example, the Voice of America does not use call letters, but does
use two bars of Yankee Doodle at the beginning and conclusion of trans-
missions and within programs.

And then, as a Ramblin' WREK from Georgia Tech, our station had appropriate
call letters.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
When I lived in Atlanta, the call letters were mundane - WGST,
Georgia School of Technology.

And, I thought VOA used "Columbia the Gem of the Ocean" as its interval
signal.

These answers are in the order I received them.  They don't disagree.
In fact, there is a certain amount of clustering, to use a currently

all sounds plausible.  So, a low-number area code is fashionable?

Phone number area codes are assigned according to the population of the city
(more or less).  The idea is for heavily populated areas (like NYC) to have
the "small" area codes.  212 (NYC) is lots faster to dial, and I guess it's
easier for some switching machines to handle) than Westchester county, NY,
which is 914.  Big cities tend to have quick-to-dial area codes.
(from memory, so don't criticize if i'm wrong)
212 NYC
202 Chicago
203 CT
213 LA
201 industrial NJ

602 All of Arizona

Subject: codes

Area codes were assigned at a time when must signalling was by the old "click"
(make-break connection) method.  The more clicks required for a signal, the
longer to set up a call.  Sending "1" takes 2 clicks; "2" is 3; and so on up
to "0", which is 11 clicks.  So...the more populous areas got the "low-click"
area codes:  New York City gets the shortest (212, 7 clicks); Los Angeles is
213, Chicago 312 - 8 clicks a piece; and so on.  (Salt Lake City, as I recall
from my time there, is 801 - actually, that's all of Utah.  A look at the phone
book reveals that "Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas"
share 809 - a prefix I remember dialing from the Mill when I talked to the
Puerto Rican plants regularly.  They, however, may have gotten stuck with a
late assignment.)

This assignment is obvious once it's pointed out, but surprisingly hard to
find on your own - certainly until you notice that "0" is "big", not "small".

Subject: Area Code Madness

Area codes are very definitely assigned according to a system.  First of
all, the middle digit has to be 0 or 1.  Once that's taken care of, the areas
with the most frequently dialed numbers get the codes with the fastest to
dial (not touch!) digits.  NYC with 212 is the tops, with 213 (LA) and
312 (Chicago) right behind. Eastern Mass with 617 isn't too bad, but areas
with a middle digit of 0 (like 603!) are lower-caste.  The worst I can
find is 809 (Bermuda, etc.), but a 909 would top that.

Of course, with Touch-Tone (tm) dialing, it makes a lot less difference.

Subject: pattern in area codes

area codes were assigned when dialing meant turning a dial, rather than
pushing a button.  the area codes are assigned so the most frequently called
areas (called from outside the area) have the least total finger travel.
thus:  new york=212, chicago=312, los angeles=213, alaska=907.
the middle digit is 1 or 0.  there are many holes in the sequence.
also, the order was an estimate of the relative frequency of calls over
some time period in the future, probably 40 or 50 years.

if you find it hard to believe ma bell could be that considerate,
remember you are not paying them while you dial.  you might spend a little
more time on the phone if you spend less time dialing.

all of the above is conjecture.  i asked the same question many years ago
but never confirmed the answer.

Subject: RE: Worth the wait?

The frosting on raisin bread (ah, how well I remember it!) fell victim to two
pernicious trends in American society:

1.  There was an outcry some years ago from the mothers of America against all
    the sugar that was just slathered on everything.  In the case of sweet
    rolls and other obvious delights, nothing was done, as the very reason for
    those things to exist is the sugar.  But raisin bread is/was supposedly a
    nutritious source of starch, vitamins, and other yecch; the fact that it
    tastes really good is/was serendipity (even raisins are GOOD for ya!)  So
    exit the frosting, which was nothing more than a sugar glaze.

2.  The second, and real reason, is that it cost too much for the barons of
    industry to stomach, so they are saving megabucks by not putting it on.

The tragedy of all this is that the major constituent of most breakfast cereals
is still sugar (53% in Apple Jacks), but it is hidden, and it thereby escapes
notice for the most part.  Note:  the expense that was cut in raisin bread was
not the sugar itself but the processing to apply it.

Have you ever watched (listened to) cereal commercials carefully?  The voice-
over ALWAYS declaims that Toasti-pops or whatever "is a part of this nutritious
breakfast."  Of course the breakfast is nutritious - it contains fresh fruit,
ham or bacon, milk, and OJ as a minimum.  Sometimes they also include toast and
jelly.  The cereal plays virtually no part in the overall benefit, but the Feds
can't cite the commercial as fraud, because there are no lies.

This is to inform you that tomorrow is my last day at DEC, after 6 years
plus a bit. My immediate plans are to finish off the degree in music
composition that I've been working on and to get a lot of
practicing done.

I have noticed that when I tell people that I quit, the people who have
been at DEC a long time understand why; the younger, more success-ridden
people are horrified.

DESPERADO has been a lot of fun (though a bit long-winded of late). Thanks

open.  If your brain is cluttered with a lot of useless facts about
geography, sports, history, pop music, jazz, halide salts, or
whatever, AND, if you're willing to come in to Newton and duke it out
with teams from all over Metro Boston on December 5, let me know.  The
teams have three members and compete as a group.  That is, we can
consult on our answers before reporting the consensus.  I have no idea
how to choose the team members, so it's open season on everything.
