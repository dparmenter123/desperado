Last year, in an effort to condition and soften a brand new ball glove,
I applied vast amounts of linseed oil to my mitt.  I am now the bewildered
owner of a five-fingered cement block.

The question is this:  what can I do to recondition the leather, dilute the
effects of the linseed oil, and accomplish my original intention to make the
leather supple?  Someone has to know what to do.

I already soaked it in a sink full of hot water, to no avail.

I would like to join the Honorable Society of We Who Have Known the Full
Fury of Mother Nature (HSWWHKFFMN).  I was born and raised in Louisville,
Kentucky, and I can concur with CACHE::BUCH on the devestation that a
tornado can do in just a few minutes.  The April, 1974, tornado that
hit there was one of nearly 100 (from what I heard) that swept through
Tornado Alley that day. Xenia, Ohio had its business district
demolished; Louisville had 2 very well-to-do neighborhoods hit hard,
and on and on and on.

I was away at Eastern Kentucky University that day where we were treated to
our very own tornado.  We were just getting the first reports of the
devastation in Xenia and Louisville when, from the 18th floor of my dorm
we got a grand show.  As the sky turned a mysterious green we watched a
large mass of dark clouds begin to swirl slowly about 15-20 miles away.
Faster and faster the clouds turned until down dropped a funnel and away
it went.  Having been briefed many times on what a tornado could do (and
how fast), we kept the door to the stairwell open in case it headed our way.
We watched as the thing went in a full circle of about a 10-15 mile radius
around us.  The whole sky lit up as it hit the power station for the area
and the campus went dark (it happened at dusk).

Later, as we went with the authorities to search for victims, we came
across a piece of straw grass driven through a piece of plywood, a road
that had large trees knocked across it like railroad ties on a train track,
and a house standing 10 feet away from a garage that was no longer there.

The worst part of all was not being able to call home to Louisville to find
out if everyone was okay.  If I recall correctly, the death toll from that
day was very low considering the devastation.

As a side note, they tested the civil defense sirens regularly in Louisville.
One very overcast test day afterwards (it may have been the 1 year anniversary)
the test sent so many citizens into a frenzy that they declared they would
never test again on days like that.

Has anyone seen the advertisement for Dow Jones/News Retrieval service?
A recent issue of FORTUNE contained one.  The bottom quarter of the page
caught my eye.  It is a picture of the PRO-350 keyboard.  When I read the
ad, I found out that there are some important "digits" that use the Dow
retrieval to keep Digital abreast of changing market conditions.  This
also had a picture of some manager sitting next to a PRO-350 with a big
smile on his face.  It was a nice ad...even though it was trying to sell
the Dow news service, it made DEC look good.

Don't be so hasty, there, &gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PSTJTT, I not only know when you wear
a dinner jacket and when you wear tails and where the dessert fork
goes, I can introduce three archbishops to each other. (You wear a
dinner jacket when you're a maitre d' and you wear tails when you are
a conductor.) And the reason I know all this nifty stuff is because my
grandmother only had one book in her house, and it was the 1947
edition of Emily Post. Thanks to my ceaseless perusal of this book, I
can tell you how to pronounce "amateur" and "brassiere", when to stand

We used to live in Kansas, when Wally was teaching at the University,
and our sojourn was marked by the role which weather came to play in
our daily lives. This was because of the lack of any other natural
stimulus in Kansas. We went two and a half years without Chinese food,
which marks one for life. We saw a phenomenon so rare that I have only
once seen a picture of it. After a frevent thunderstorm, Wally and I
went for a walk to see the wreckage and smell the ozone. The sky was
full of what looked like fluffy basketballs. That is, there was a
cloud cover over most of the sky, and the clouds were in the shape of
spheres, all touching tangentially. We went immediately to the
excellent Lawrence, KS, library, and looked them up in a book of
weather, and discovered that they are called Mammary Clouds. This
discloses a preference on the part of the meteorologist unlikely to be
satisfied by anything short of Diana of Ephesus or Eccentrica
Gallumbits in a mirror. But it was an interesting natural phenomenon.

As one who had to learn English in my late teens, I realized very quickly
that the language is a lot "looser" than my native languages (French and
German).  In this regard, it's a departure from the indo-germanic norm,
which is gender sensitive.  In both French and German, possessive pronouns
are inflected according to gender, so that no confusion between possessives
and contractions is possible.  I like English, but I honestly miss the
precision of French and German when I have to write in English...

I can't resist adding to the "natural phenomena" catalogue... August
30, 1965--Thunder Bay, Ontario (formerly Fort William/Port Arthur).  I
was driving back from a summer session at the university of Saskatchewan.
My companion and I decided to stop and camp on the shore of Lake Superior
about 10 miles west of the city.  We got the tent erected and were about
to turn in when we noticed some peculiar "magnetic" phenomena: our watches
had stopped, and so had the clock in the van; the tent poles felt "funnny".
(This was about 11:00 pm.)  All of a sudden, there was a crack of thunder
and the entire sky, from horizon to horizon, looked like a neon grid.
I've never seen anything like this--it was lightning.  The "electical
storm continued with such displays for about an hour, then things returned
to normal.  There was no wind and no rain.

The next day we stopped at a local restaurant.  The waiter said this was
fairly typical for late August.  Apparently it has something to do with
the magnetic properties of the "Canadian Shield"...

Subject: The size of Alaska

Although I spent January through March 1956 in Fairbanks, I really don't
know how the size of Alaska compares with Massachusetts, my native state.
While on the subject, Texans beware!  I've heard that cutting Alaska
into two equal parts would make Texas the third largest state!

As for spectacular things in nature, I lived only a mile from the path
of the tornado that passed through the Worcester area in 1953.  The
destruction evidenced by shattered/scattered homes and uprooted LARGE
trees left an impression on me of the force of nature that will last
a lifetime.  Nature also has a beautiful side.  I have spent many
hours watching the aurora as a boy in Northboro (where I now live)
and when I was in Alaska.  The aurora lit the area near Fairbanks
nearly as bright as a full moon.  Auroras are sometimes visible this
far south if you can get away from manmade light.  Most recently,
I spent a few hours watching the aurora on the evening of September
5th, 1982.

Well, I didn't see the infamous Tornado That Hit Chelmsford several years ago
(I can't recall the exact year, alas), but I *did* see The House That Was
Demolished By The Tornado That Hit Chelmsford.  Does that count?  (Yes,
Chelmsford, Massachusetts, my ol' home town.)  The house was completely
flattened; fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  I also
saw the swath the tornado cut through some woods not very far from mine own
residence (it considerately skipped over my neighborhood).  The woods did
indeed look, as CACHE::BUCH put it, as though a 200-foot-wide Lawnboy rolled
through them.  I was quite impressed.  Not to mention grateful that no worse
damage had been done and that no casualties resulted from the tornado's visit.

That same expanse of tornado-damaged woods has since become a suburban housing
development.  No doubt the contractors were grateful for the head start the
tornado gave them in tearing down the trees...

        For fans of the American Heritage Dictionary (I don't like it that
much), the plurals for hippopotamus and cactus are given as EITHER
hippopotamuses and cactuses OR hippopotami and cacti.  How's that for
straddling the fence?  Actually, Webster's New World Dictionary agrees and
even includes one more for hippopotamus:  hippopotamus.  Yes, the singular form
can also be used as the plural, just as "deer" and "fish" are both singular and
plural.  Webster's even gives three plurals for octopus, namely octopuses,
octopi, and octopodes.
        Regarding hippopotamus, Allan Sherman favored the "i" ending.  One of
the songs on his album "My Son The Nut" begins:

                One Hippopotami
                Cannot get on a bus
                Because one Hippopotami
                Is two Hippopotamus.

(It was a song about plurals where he also noted "that the plural of half is
whole", and "a parakeet is not a pair".)

        Moving right along, I don't know how obdurate his poetry is in general,
but the following example shows Auden wasn't adverse to a little joke now and
then:

                As the poets have mournfully sung,
                Death takes the innocent young,
                  The laughingly funny,
                  The rolling in money,
                And those who are very well hung.

        I saw the Aurora Borealis many times while stationed in Iceland during
my Navy days.  Up there it is truly spectacular, filling the entire sky with
waving sheets of light.

and a Sea Story?  A Fairy Tale begins "Once upon a time..."  and a Sea
Story begins "This ain't no shit...")

QUESTION:  How does the size of Alaska compare with the size of Massachusetts?
ANSWER:    It doesn't.

Also, in comparison to the 50 states, Alaska has:

        The longest coastline.
        The highest mountains (the top three).
        The most lakes (about 10 times as many as Minnesota).
        The furthest westward extension (the Aleutian islands extend further
                                        west than Hawaii).

Here's the answer to my question about Alas vs Mass:

The answers my friend gets range from people not knowing if Alaska is REALLY
bigger than Mass. or if they're about the same size, to people who
think Alaska is 2-3 times as large, to people who think that Alaska
is about 20 times as large.  The real answer is that Alaska is over
70 TIMES the size of Mass. (Alaska: area= 586,400 sq mi pop= 302,000.
Mass: area= 8,257 pop = 5,689,000.) The actual figure is ~71.02 times.

Well I must thank everyone for their comments to desperado regarding
the subject of Millrats.

I thought that they were kidding, I guess that they weren't, but it
did prepare me somewhat for entering the.....MILL!

This place is really bizzare. No kidding.  I actually walked in my
first day and had an office (cube) fit for downhill skiing.

I had heard that I am fortunate, most have peaks and valleys in them,
better for cross-country.

Some have poles in the middle, what a strange practice finding someone
by a pole number - my identity is a pole - am I really a pole? - like,
totally.

These offices are much better for downhill racing as they require some
expertise to negotiate the poles. The corridor is a great sled run.
And of course, there is the Mill pond for ice skating.

I actually had a file cabinet held uphill in my cube by a two-by-four.
Luckly, I had been resourceful enough to bring enough printed material
to serve as ballast.

This part of the Mill (the unfinished part of 3-5) is not wired for
data, instead they gave me a terminal and a DF03 modem that never
worked.  So they had a great solution they gave me a Vadic acoustic
coupler.  An acoustic COUPLER!!!!! I haven't seen one of these things
since I worked for Dartmouth Time Sharing (DTSS). I belive they must
have given me the Kewit autograph model with a pencil inscription
"Good Luck from Dr. K" and "The big E. was here, class of 1912".  I
mean we even had Prime X.25 front ends back then!!!! This is 1983
isn't it??!! Well at least it works.

More you say? Well my telephone extension hasn't call fowarded since
I've been here. So I called to find out if that could be fixed, since
my sec. is on 5-2. I had been told that they (whoever they are) are
"revamping" (whatever that means in this context) the PABX and that
requests (requests?) for call forwarding have been frozen for four to
five weeks....Arrrrrrrr!!!!!

I guess that if I were Snoopy or Charlie Brown I could sum this
up in the following way:

"Happiness is being on 5-2 with the rest of your group and actually
 meeting some of the people you work with, maybe even have some
 people to go out to lunch with ... *sigh*"

Well, I must be going now there seems to be a slight earthquake
and my file cabinet is in danger of colliding with my person.

P.S. Does anyone REALLY know what those rumbling sounds in the
     hallways are? I probably don't want to know..right?

Subject: A parable on the "small is good" issue

Scenario:  DIGITAL decides  to  compete  with  Duncan  Hines  for  the
packaged cake mix market.

Survey  of  Competitive  Literature:   Duncan   Hines   includes   all
instructions  needed  to  create  the cake on the back of the package.
Instructions are simple:

      o  Dump the mix, one egg, and a half cup of water in a bowl

      o  Beat this mixture for 3 minutes

      o  Pour it into a 9 by 13 pan

      o  Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes

First draft:  Writer whips  together  one  page  of  instructions  for
making   cake.   (Writer  was  unable  to  test  instructions  because
prototype mix was not yet available;  however, that is never an excuse
for slipping schedule.)

Technical Review:  Development returns draft  with  copious  comments.
After conference with developers, writer discovers that DIGITAL's cake
mix is much more than a cake mix;  it's a veritable bakery in a box.

There are at least three different ways cooks can use  it  to  make  a
cake.   Adding the egg is an optional step.  (One of the developers is
a  backpacking  enthusiast.   He  theorized  that  deleting  the   egg
requirement  would  increase  the customer base to include campers and
those on low cholesterol diets.) However, if the egg is omitted, cooks
must increase the water to 3/4 cup.

Cooks can  also  improve  the  taste  of  the  cake  by  adding  three
tablespoons  of  oil.  However, if the cooks add oil, they must reduce
the water to 1/4 cup and cut the egg in half.

The temperature at which the cake must bake depends on the  choice  of
ingredients  added  to  the mix and also on the oven used by the cook.
(DIGITAL manufactures three types of ovens;  therefore, cooks must  be
able  to  bake  the cake in any of these.  Oven number three is a real
antique  and  slated  for  retirement  in  a   year.    Unfortunately,
instructions  for  oven  number three must be included because DIGITAL
still supports it.)

Second Draft:  This  draft  is  three  pages  of  dense  instructions.
Writer  attempts to lighten the impact with conversational tone, color
coding and bulleted lists.  Editor and  production  staff  go  bananas
trying  to  figure out how to package instructions with the box of mix
(forget about fitting them on the wrapper).  Final decision is to  ram
the pamphlet in the box with the mix and include a To the Cook note on
the back of the package to let cooks know where the instructions are.

Field Test:  Sites rave about the  cake  mix  and  its  documentation.
Several  insist  on  knowing  how  to use the mix to make brownies and
chocolate cookies.  (Writer adds these instructions, but wonders  just
how  many  cooks  will  be  using  the mix to make anything other than
cakes.  Development insists that cooks  want  freedom  of  choice  and
fears SPRs if customers discover undocumented ways to use the mix.)

Sign Off Draft:  Development informs writer that instructions must  be
included  for the microwave oven DIGITAL has just readied for release.
(Writer giggles and adds Appendix A, Microwave Notes.)

Post Release:

Case 1:  Cake mix does not sell as well as everyone expected.

The cake produced with the DIGITAL mix is far superior in taste to the
Duncan  Hines  mix.   Everybody  agrees  on  that  point.  The obvious
difference between  the  two  products  is  the  instruction  package.
Therefore, the problem is a documentation problem.  Now if DIGITAL can
only get those verbose writers to create smaller books....

Case 2:  The cake mix sells far better than anyone expected.

The cake produced with the DIGITAL mix is far superior in taste to the
Duncan Hines mix.  Customers love it;  however, they inundate software
support and  development  with  many  questions  about  the  cake-  vs
brownie-  vs  cookie-making process.  There are also many requests for
faster  baking  time  and  methods  to  optimize   oven   performance.
Simultaneously,  customers  complain that the mix instructions are too
difficult to understand and do not cover all  cake  mix  applications.
("I simply must add nuts and raisins, but when I do, the cake fails to
rise.  Please explain.")

As a result, the next version of the cake mix goes  out  with  a  five
pound  tome  that doubles the cost of the mix.  Now customers complain
that:  the mix costs too much, their recipe stands cannot support  the
weight  of  the instructions, and they do not like cross references to
oven documentation.  Some customers, software support  personnel,  and
sales people point out that Duncan Hines fit all cake mix instructions
on the back of the package.  Therefore, the problem is a documentation
problem.   Now if DIGITAL can only get those verbose writers to create
smaller books....

Moral (take your pick):

You can't have your cake and eat it, too.

Ease of use goes down as complexity goes up.

Too many cooks spoil the broth.

A product cannot accommodate everyone's "gut feelings."

"Gut feelings" should be based on marketing data.

Five fanatic customers can generate 500 SPRs that have no meaning  for

The game of slapjack can be explained in one paragraph;  the game  of
chess  cannot.   (Has anyone suggested that a chess game could be made
easier to master by providing fewer instructions?)

Writing for DIGITAL can be hazardous to your sanity.

Subject: Node names

The ENET support group has just chosen VORTEX as the name for
their new node.  This happens to be the name of Lauren Weinstein's
node on the USENET (the net that such things as decvax and decwrl
are on).

Lauren is extremely annoyed -- he wants to be unique.  So annoyed,
in fact, that he is threatening to write letters to K.O.  Or have
his lawyer do so.  Unless they agree to change their node name.

Lauren is an ARPAnet hotshot and big contributor to the (missing)
SCIENCE_FICTION_LOVERS mailings.  And he doesn't have a leg to stand
on that I can see.

On our own net we have nodes named RAINBW and RAINBO.
