 I was not entirely idle during the Desperado Drought.  Since I was
 laid off I have been working on a book on words and how best to use
 them.  I'll be giving out free samples from time to time.  Following
 is one.

 ANGRY and HUNGRY

 Millions of hours have been spent searching for the mysterious "third
 word in the English language ending in -gry".  This search is the
 grammatical equivalent of the "mathematical problem" of squaring the
 circle, a quest of no interest to professionals yet of endless
 fascination to amateurs.  Tawdry is the only word in the English
 language ending in -wdry while cwm is the only word in the English
 language ending in -wm.  Incidentally, the Random House Unabridged,
 through the search feature of the CD-ROM version, yields six words
 ending in -gry:  angry, half-angry, hungry, over-angry, and unangry.
 The -gry is no rude Saxon suffix come down to us, but only what
 happens when you add the adjectivizing -y onto a word ending in -ger.
 This has happened only twice.

 To address another feckless quest, there is no rhyme for purple, but
 doorhinge does a pretty good job of rhyming with orange, if you must.

 As for the tagalong vowel "and sometimes y", I submit the following
 masterpiece:

        Pygmy nymphs (by myth) tryst shyly,
        Try dry crypt myrrh, ply nymphs slyly.

A recent newspaper story described the dilapidated state of the Russian
Orthodox churches being given back to the church by the Russian
government. Most have the glass missing from their windows, the
religious icons are missing, etc.

My friend Howard, upon reading the article, commented:

"No windows, no icons? I guess they'll have to say Mass at the prompt."

     Heel types:             Louis XV:   The typical form of a 'high heel':

                                  (
                                   \ /\

                             Queeny:     Like the Louis XV but the tip of
                                         the heel is placed more to the toe:

                                   (
                                    \

                             Block:      Massive heel (opposite of stilet-
                                         to), usually used for platform shoes:

                                  (
                                   \

                                               heel but ends wide:

                                    \ /\

MCI seems to have lost its mind.

(from the big net in the sky:)

In case you haven't seen or heard this yet, MCI has created the wackiest,
most useless 800 number around.  I can't describe it except to say you
must call:
        1-800-969-4874   [1-800-WOW-IT'S-HOT]
(from a touchtone phone).  Very Pink, and yet Slackful.  I call on my
speaker phone and let the dulcet tones fill my office with... oh, you'll
see... and it's FREE!

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
 I recall a cold version of the same thing.  Strange fancies.  I
 guess MCI wants us to get used to the idea of dialling.
