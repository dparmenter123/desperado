        This one was spied at the intersection where what's left of
Route 290 meets the road leading to the Hudson Plant (Massachusetts'
own "Silicon Valley"; or so I hear...):

                        RPM CPA

        Are these initials?  or is it a contrived way of saying "Tachs
Accountant"?

About a year ago I saw a Maine plate,

       IM LATE

Unimpressed, I realized some minutes later that I was following a White Rabbit.

    I was on my way to the Mill the other morning.  Couldn't have asked
    for a better morning to be out on the road.  Guess the State Police
    had the holiday off.  I was traveling through Westford on Route 495
    in the southbound warp drive lane.  I passed a car moving at a
    rather leisurely pace in the "I'm gonna pass her in the breakdown
    lane" lane.  I overroad my Fuzzbuster interfaced forward firing retro
    rockets to confirm what I am about to describe...

    A yellow, late model Cadillac
    Well polished with a moderate amount of chrome
    An "older" (elderly) woman at the wheel
    Very conservatively dressed in black
    An elevated hair setting, held firmly together with either hair netting
     or spray
    Bespectacled and attentive to the road ahead
    She could have been your mother or mine

    But her vehicle plates painted a different picture. I'll have to mention
    this one to the Motor Vehicle Registration people in Concord next week
    while I'm picking up my DECBUG plates for the VW.

                        Car Numbers U.K. style........

Here in the U.K. car numbers are issued from a central government department
and are for the life of the car. The format for these numbers is ;

        up to July 1983,        X X X   9 9 9 X
                                _ ___   _____ _
                                |  |      |   |
                +---------------+  |      |   +-------------------+
                |              +---+      +-------+               |
                |              |                  |               |
        First letter       area vehicle       2nd part of     Year of
        user with the      was registered     numeric code    registration.
        three digits       ie. county
        form a numeric
        code.

From August this year the format has been reversed to X999 XXX as we have now
been through the alphabet for the year of registration. ( A - 1963 to Y - '83
missing out I,O,Q,U and Z). The new format starts again at 'A'.

After that lengthy explanation of our numbering system here I'm sure that you
will appreciate that humourous or meaningful car numbers are few and far
between. ( also much sought after and highly prized - if you really want a
particular number you've to buy the car....).

Favourite tricks are ;
                        rounding the corners of '5's ( for 'S')
                        filing down '1's ( for 'I's )
                        'losing' the space between letters &amp; digits
                        (or 'misplacing' it)
                        '4's for 'A's
                        etc.

All above practices are of course illegal........

So at last.... numbers seen around,

        BP O1L   -  on a British Petroleum Land Rover

        NEM151S  -  on a Ford Escort

        ISR43L   -  (? ISRAEL ?)

        NOI5E    -  on a Mini

        V FA5T   -  on a Porche

Enough for now - more will follow...
                                     Alan

Last words,

        Don't send chain letters out to the ARPA net or DEC may lose
        its gateway.  This is a real possibility.

And,

        Joe Farrell, who collects the mugs and buttons, is
        VLNVAX::FARRELL, not MRSVAX::FARRELL as stated last ish.

Have a good Thanksgiving.  I'll be in the woods north of Berlin, NH.
