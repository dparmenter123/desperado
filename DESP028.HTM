Parts of speech and sentence diagrams exist whether you believe in
them or not.  They are the skeletal structure underlying the living
flesh of language.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I beg to disagree.  In fact, I disagree without begging.

Parts of speech and sentence diagrams are not the underlying structure
of language, they are more analogous to the concepts of phlogiston and
the ether, plausible, temporary explanations for interesting phenomena.

What part of speech is "dog"?

How is "dog" used in sentences?  Explain with diagrams.

A bit of dialog:

        Mike:  "A sentence consists of a subject and verb and an
                optional object."

        Ike:   "Oh?"

Languages consist of words and people use the words correctly.

Granted, I'm a real radical on this.

Subject: Pepsi Free

As a Pepsi loyalist in this building full of (yecch) Coke machines, I
welcomed the addition of Pepsi Free.  My problem with Pepsi (and coffee)
is that I can't drink it at night or else I'll never get to sleep.
Pepsi Free actually comes in two versions, one with sugar, one without.
Oddly enough, the with-sugar version says that it's "99% Caffine Free",
while the sugar-free version just says "no caffine".  I'm not sure this
is significant.

Anyway, I am happy to report that Pepsi Free (sugared version) tastes
just like normal Pepsi.  Right now there is an advantage to buying Pepsi
Free in that it is typically being sold at lower prices than Pepsi
(0.99 vs. 1.29 for 2L) and there are coupons worth 25-50 cents off floating
around in the papers.  I expect that the price difference will vanish
when the "introductory period" is over.

For those who like the Pepsi taste but can't afford it, I've found that
C&amp;C Cola and Shasta Cola taste a lot like Pepsi - many other bargain brands
taste like (yecch) Coke.  These typically sell for 89 cents for a 2L bottle.

Yecch, indeed.  I'm from Georgia where we understand what Coca-Cola is
all about.  I note that the Pepsi "loyalist" will drink any kind of
semi-generic bellywash that saves him 3 cents a bottle.  A Coke
drinker won't drink any other "cola", but simply shifts to 7UP or Dr.
Pepper when The Real Thing ain't available.  Price is no object.

Everybody sing along!

                "It's The Real Thing.  In the back of your mind.

I concede from your mention of Merkin Muffley (ah, how quickly we forget!) that
you do indeed know what a merkin is.  Now, what WAS a merkin, oh, say 200 years

first box-office smash X-rated movie "Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy
Humppe and Find True Happiness?"?

Subject: WMEX

I wasn't listening to WMEX in the late '60s, but I'm not surprised to
hear that it had unusual programming.  It always did.

In the late '40s and early '50s I used to listen to it and visit the
station (on Brookline Ave. near Kenmore Sq.).

I think that all the management cared about was that horse racing
results were accurate and on time -- and that the ethnic programs had
lots of sponsors (Morrison &amp; Schiff brought us the Joseph Tall hour).

Aside from that there seemed to be a lot more leeway for noncommercial
program.

Nat Hentoff got away with at least three such programs:

  The Jazz Album, From Bach to Bartok, and The World in Folksong.

The engineer on Hentoff's programs was usually Arnie Ginsberg.

There was also This is Brown Boston, a program of black community
news before it was fashionable.

Psychiatrist Shep Ginandes used to sing his own songs and play guitar
-- both with a wry wit (In an anarchistic garret, so meager and so
mean, smell the pungent odor of nitro glyc-er-een...).

And at WHDH was Matinee with Bob and Ray plus DEC's own Lew Stone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
In my first week at DEC and first week in the computer industry, I
went into Lew Stone's office and said, "Lew, I've got a stupid
question for you."  I've quoted his response many times since then, in
many situations: "The stupid questions are the ones you don't ask."

In the old barnstorming days of aviation, a pilot, with his old trusty
bi-plane, would land in some farmer's field and offer to put on a show;
splitting the take with the farmer.  To publicize the event, they would
put out written announcements ("Fliers!") and, on the appointed day, the
crowd would gather round at the farm and watch the show.

If the flier blew it, and flew into the ground, he was said to have
"bought the farm" as opposed to just renting it for the afternoon.

The notes file quoted here, VAXWRK::SYS$NOTES:TRIVIA, is an amazing
heap of stuff, with much perhaps of interest to Desperados.  I think
though that there were fliers (bulletins) before there were fliers
(pilots).  After all, the bulletins fly around.

The discussion on street musicians reminded me of an article I once read on a
late-nineteenth/early-twentieth century Christmas celebration held each year
on Beacon Hill.  It started out as a local celebration for residents, but over
the years attracted riff-raff (read Irish) from other parts of the city.  It
finally was abandoned because, in the immortal words of one resident, "drunks,
rowdies, and accordian players abounded".

Another indication that street musicians were disliked by our fin-de-seicle
ancestors was the line in the Mikado placing "Banjo serenaders" on Koko's
list of people who will "surely not be missed."

Today's mail contained an anouncement of a seminar on "DESPERANTO".  Hoping
that it would be a lively discussion on how to spell "privilege", the origin
of the phrase "the whole nine-yards", and other linguistic matters, I read
further.  Alas, it turned out to be about "an Esperanto for distributed
systems".  Sigh.  On the other hand, it promises to discuss something called
"guest layering" which sounds interesting and useful on cold winter nights.

No, WMEX (formerly WITS) is now WMRE, and they play "Music of Your Life"
format music.  The person whose life they play lives in 1943.  In most
other markets where that format has started, the so-programmed radio
station has had dramatic gains in audience.  Beware.

To those Desperadoes who gave me the call-DCL-from-within-another-process

And now a quick trip to the obscure words department...
There's a product in supermarkets lately called "Spread" (and sometimes
"Spred").  It's sort of a greasy, tasteless, sickly whiteish-yellow product
that's (I guess) imitation margarine [which makes it imitation imatation
butter?].  Can you picture the guys at SoyTech, Inc. sitting around the
board room trying to think of a generic name for this product?  "Spred!"
shouts one gentleman in a gray flannel suit.  "No, that's not quite
the image we're looking for." says gentleman number two. "I think 'Spread'
is more in the SoyTech family image!"

editor originally named: ED. To print the first 23 lines of your file
(there really is no type command on Primos except listf, yuck) you
would type p23.  Most people would do this as an automatic reflex

Dateline Tewksbury, Massachusetts, December 17, 1982 - DP - In honour of the
79th anniversary of the noninvention by Wilbur and Orville Wright of powered
flight (heavier-than-air), I'd like to remember the name of the New Zealand-
er who really DID invent said mode of transport.  If memory serves, his ini-
tial flight was sometime in 1902, but he never achieved  controlled  flight;
that accomplishment is indeed the Wrights'.  Do any of the Desperados know
his name?

"Invention" and "discovery" are always controversial.  Ever hear of
Emil Berliner?  To be credited as the inventor or discoverer, you have
to be a successful business promoter, not just a technical whiz.
America was named after a guy in the map business.  My father's
college friend, John Athanasoff, invented the memory-refreshed
stored-program computer, but World War II got in the way.  Mauchly
corresponded with him intently and intensely about his machine, but in
later life refused to acknowledge any intellectual indebtedness.  A
court later determined that Athanassoff had in fact been the inventor.
See the September Datamation (25th anniversary issue) for an excellent
article on Athanassoff and another on other computer pioneers.

Over the weekend, after writing the above, I came across the below in
a book review in the Atlantic Monthly:

       "Langley, Bleriot, Chanute, Santos-Dumont, Farman . . . all
        staggered into the air in string-and-stick creations enclosing
        one of the new small petrol engines, each claiming a 'first'
        of some sort.  Though their creations were comically inept,
        each believed himself a new Icarus, and each had his champions
        for decades afterward. . . . Now, however, thanks to a
        lifetime of painstaking scholarship by an official of the
        Victoria and Albert Museum, C.H. Gibbs-Smith, the history
        books now accept what every schoolchild has always known: that
        the first 'powered, sustained, and controlled flight' was made
        by Orville Wright, at Kitty Hawk, in North Carolina, on
        December 17, 1903."

Subject: DCL commands from an image

In the last DESPERADO (#1007), you asked for a way to execute DCL commands
from a VMS image which returns to the caller after the command is done.
You aren't the only one; we've received four SPRs since V3.0 asking for the
same thing.  Funny thing is that we put just such a thing in V3.0, but
lots of people haven't noticed, even though it got a big writeup as a new

Subject: Re:  Information request in Desperado

It's quite easy to execute DCL commands and return afterwards by using
LIB$SPAWN, the callable form of the SPAWN command.  If only one DCL command is
involved, you can pass it in the call; if more than one, you can write a file
and have it executed.  (You could probably make the file a mailbox.)  The
tricky part is to make sure that you assign explicit SYS$INPUT and SYS$OUTPUT
values (analogous to the /INPUT and /OUTPUT qualifiers on SPAWN) if you expect
to execute the program making the call from inside a command procedure.  (If
the current SYS$INPUT and SYS$OUTPUT in the spawnING procedure are process-
permanent files, the spawn will fail.  If the spawned procedure is to talk to
the terminal, bind these files to the translation of SYS$COMMAND.  You cannot
do this in a batch process.  If you don't care where the default I/O goes, just
use _NL: for it.)

There is one problem with this, which may be what you are concerned with:  The
DCL command gets executed in a subprocess, so, for example, you can't use this
to define a symbol in the calling process.  There is no general way to do stuff
in the current process that I know of.  However, just about every DCL command
that would be of interest (i.e. not including, say, FORTRAN, or LINK, which
could as well run in a subprocess) has a "callable" form; look in the Run-Time
Library manual.

Hope this helps.

Here's the latest info:

(1) No software other than that included with the Robin is available
from DEC. Later in the Spring, a file tranfer utility will be released.
Included with the Robin is a catalog of software available from outside
vendors. There is no discount on this software.

(2) There are no resale limitations associated with this offer.

(3) Two of each item are available including Packages 1 AND 2. Thus
you can buy two complete systems PLUS two systems without VT100's.

(4) Your check MUST be cerified even if from the DCU.

(5) If you know a friend in N.H., you can ship it to c/o that person
to avoid the Mass. tax.

(6) For more information, contact Jim Kinlan, DTN 278-4024.
