        I saw "Glengarry Glen Ross" the other week.  It's full of actors
        and is a lot like a play.  When Al Pacino and all but one of the
        other actors are in a scene, you're thinking, "This is mighty fine
        acting.  It's been a long time since I've seen better."  When Jack
        Lemmon is on the screen, you're thinking, "What is this man going
        to do!  He's really up against it.  His daughter is sick.  He
        can't sell any more.  They won't give him the leads."  Without
        Lemmon, it's a good show.  With him, it's a tragedy.  I read later
        that Lemmon considered this the role of a lifetime.  That should
        be enough to send you out to see it.

Subj:   more stupid things people do

never under estimate a user...

Subject: Re: Stupid things people do

I was working as a programmer for a military command center, the kind with
large screens around the walls which display current status of whatever.  The
system was a custom job with custom software, but was fairly stable (no
outstanding software problem reports, no recent modifications).  Normal
operations 24 hours / day, 7 days / week.

One Monday morning about 0600, the system crashed.  No problem.  The operator
initiated warm start on the hot backup system and dump procedures on the failed
machine; back on-line in less than 3 minutes (and called me, midnight shift
programming support).  A few minutes later the alternate system crashed.  What
to do?  (The dump takes about 11 minutes.  If we abort the dump to get on-line
as fast as possible, we lose any chance of finding out why the first crash
occurred.  And the primary system may go down again if we have an unrepaired
hardware problem.  But since both systems crashed within minutes of each other,
its probably a software problem, so if I don't get the dump, we have ZERO
chance of finding out what happened.)  Call the command post for permission to
complete the dump.  Denied.  Abort the dump.  Reboot the primary.  Initiate
dump on the alternate.  The primary crashes again.  Reboot the alternate.
Initiate dump on the primary.  The alternate crashes again.  This time we get
permission to allow the dumps to complete.  Reboot and back on-line.  By now,
it's after 0700.

Start analyzing what happened.  Trace the problem to a data input routine.
Hmmmmm. Seems like its overrunning the buffer and trashing an adjacent data
structure.  Can't be, the buffer is already larger than the physical limit on
the terminal (an IBM 2701 - a then modern but now ancient IBM Selectric
ball-type typewriter rigged as a computer input device).  Quick fix: move the
adjacent data structure further away from the buffer, re-assemble (Yes,
Virginia, we had computers before we had compilers.  What's that, you little
snot?  Yes, I did work on them and no it was not before Christ.), bring the
alternate to "hot backup" status and do a switchover.  Take a deep breath and
start figuring out WHY it happened, because the General has missed his Monday
morning briefing and is going to want to know whether he cna count on his
primary command and control system or not.

Hit a stone wall.  Couldn't find anything wrong with the code.  So I put an
alarm in that input routine, took my chewing out and went on with life.  Two
weeks later, my alarm went off.  The system didn't crash because I had moved
that fragile data structure, but it would have if I hadn't moved it.  The alarm
also triggered an on-line dump and, when I checked it, sure enough, that same
terminal had overrun its buffer again.  But it can't!  The buffer is 128
characters deep and the IBM 2701 is only 85 characters wide; you HAVE to enter
a carriage return to continue.

Well, not quite.  I finally made the connection between one particular Major
inputting data for the General's morning briefing and the alarms.  It seems
this Major had figured out that the display screens could handle lines 132
characters long even though the input devices could only provide 85.  So when
he got to the end of a line on the terminal, he would grab the typewriter ball,
drag it to the left, manually roll the paper forward and keep typing.  As long
as he was entering less than 128 characters, everything was ok.  But when he
went over that, ...

    I don't know if either of you reads Open Systems Today (yet another
    predominantly UNIX trade rag).  In case you don't, I thought I'd
    pass along this gem of techno-babble.  In response to a question
    posed to readers ("Will Windows NT Be The Death Of UNIX?") one
    guy responded:

      "I would rather gnaw my leg off, pack the bleeding stump with
       salt, and run in a circle on broken glass than have to deal
       with any Microsoft product on a regular basis.  That company
       has made a business of releasing overhyped, overpriced,
       nonfunctional code for many years, and I think it would be a
       great boon to mankind if the entire state of Washington were
       jettisoned from the face of the earth just to get rid of
       Microsoft."

    There's more, but that's the best part.  Gee, couldn't he have
    just wished that Bill Gates drop off the earth, rather than
    condemn the entire state?

           THE LATEST BUNCH OF FAMED ROCK&amp;ROLLERS ADDED TO THE HALL

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Okay, some more people were added to the Rock&amp;Roll Hall of Fame
        this fall, but I didn't get around to 'em until now.  When you see
        who made it, you'll see why I was slow to move.

        The Doors

        Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!

        I knew the Doors were unavoidable eventually, but that they should
        get in before Bobby Freeman, Bobby Lewis, Bobbie Gentry, Bobby Day,
        Bobby Hebb,  Bobby Vee, Bobby Sherman, Bobby Rydell, Bobby Vinton,
        and James and Bobby Purify were tapped to join Bobby Darin in the
        Hall of Fame is pretty hard to understand.  Not to mention the
        Bobbettes.

        No band without a bass player should ever be allowed in.

        No band that steals songs from the Kinks should ever be allowed in
        (except the Kinks, themselves, of course).

        No band whose singer knows only three notes and can't hit two of
        them should ever be allowed in.  (Tough to enforce, I guess.)

        No band that does no more than lift the best from Baudelaire and
        the worst from Las Vegas should ever be allowed in.

        "But it's poetry!"  So said my lovely teen-aged Spanish amiga.  No
        band that sings poetry should ever be allowed in.  I did have the
        pleasure of explaining "Back Door Man" to her, in my best Spanish:
        "Es una referencia al amor en culo."

        No band I hate as much as the Doors should ever be allowed in.

        Cream

        Really?  Two-hit wonder.  ("Sunshine of Your Love" and "White
        Room", for the curious, with a wave of the hand to non-hits
        "Badge" and "Tales of Brave Ulysses".)

        The Hall of Fame has a hard time with groups versus individuals in
        groups, as I always say.  Sure, put Eric Clapton in there.  But
        Cream?  Ginger Baker is in there with Al Jackson Jr. as "members"
        (read "employees") of groups but Hal Blaine ain't nowhere to be
        seen?

        BUT, the Hall has a hard time with instrumentalists versus
        vocalists, too.  If you put Eric Clapton in the Hall, it has to be
        as an instrumentalist.  His songs and singing aren't much.  (Please
        recall that I restrict rock&amp;roll to music that somehow either rocks
        or rolls, preferably both.  Clapton actually wrote the line "I love
        screaming guitars" in a song that had not one single bar of
        screaming guitar.)  And, if Eric gets in as an instrumentalist, then
        what about Hal Blaine, Lee Allen, Link Wray, Big Jay McNeely, James
        Jamerson, Earl Palmer, Scotty Moore, Bill Doggett, Joe Houston, Doc
        Bagby, Mickey Baker, Panama Francis, Lefty Bates, Jerome Green, Big
        Al Sears, Arnett Cobb, Van "Piano Man" Walls, Ywingwie Malmsteen
        (is everyone still awake?), Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, Johnny
        Johnson, or Dave Bartholomew?

        Is Eric Clapton worth more than Guitar Slim?  Would he claim to be?

        Ruth Brown

        Never wanted to be a rock&amp;roller.  Performed with classic
        restraint under the control of dictatorial producers and made some
        of the best singles ever.  "Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean" can
        stand for all of them.  Now butchering the same songs in her live
        show with all manner of artistic whoops and swoops.

        How come *Charles* Brown isn't in the Hall?

        Etta James

        Fully deserved, although she now repudiates "The Wallflower" (known
        by the less knowing as "Roll With Me, Henry" and by the even less
        knowing as "Dance With Me, Henry").  Unknown classic:  "The
        Pickup", a wonderful conversation between Etta and the tenor
        player.

        Creedence Clearwater Revival

        Talk about having the magic touch.  And, yes, they should be in as
        "the band" even though we all know it was John Fogerty all the way.

        Sly &amp; The Family Stone

        The first time I heard "Dance to the Music", I pulled over to the
        side of the road to listen for fear I would wreck the car if I kept
        on driving.  I never grokked until recently that the players were
        chosen for having voices that sounded like their instruments.

        Van Morrison

        Would he be in if he hadn't written a song about Jackie Wilson?
        (Reference:  Desperado #3046)  Has also repudiated, or at least
        downplayed, his rock&amp;roll career in favor of his tragic Irish
        artist career.  Oh, well.

        Nominated, but not yet elected:  Animals (good blues boys, wrote
        the theme song for the Vietnam War); Buffalo Springfield (nah,
        one-hit wonder); Grateful Dead (inevitable, alas); Little Willie
        John (great one); the Rascals (a/k/a "the Young Dynamic Rascals"
        when they were at their best; I love 'em, but HoF?); Rod Stewart
        (Wait a minute!  Did that say Rod Stewart?); Velvet Underground
        (inevitable and infinitely preferable to the Doors); Frank Zappa
        (Oh, sure, why not?).

        Still no Sam the Sham, no Dinah Washington, no Willie Dixon, no
        Jelly Roll Morton.  That damn Belly Roll Morrison is in there,
        but not Jelly Roll Morton!

&gt;  Subject: our correspondents report...
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;From a friend's birth announcement for their child A----:
&gt;
&gt;     No, we didn't forget to mention whether A----- was a boy or a girl.
&gt;     We deliberately left it out -- another decision made many months
&gt;     ago. We are concerned about early gender stereotyping. Studies have
&gt;     shown (see the bibliography at the end of this announcement) that
&gt;     adult perception of infant behaviour is affected more by the
&gt;     perceived sex of the child than the actual behaviour of the child.
&gt;     There is a difference in the way adults talk to girl babies and boy
&gt;     babies; there is a difference in the way adults hold and play with
&gt;     girl babies and boy babies.  We think that the sex of a newborn
&gt;     child who will still be sorting out its senses and perceptions for
&gt;     weeks if not months after birth is the least interesting bit of
&gt;     information about that child. We hope you'll help us in our task of
&gt;     raising our child properly by focussing on A----- as a developing
&gt;     human being, with all the wonder that entails.

        Gee, my studies show just the opposite, and I watch my graddaughter
        very closely.

        I had always thought there were babies, and that about some age or
        other, probably due in part to sexual stereotyping, they turned
        into girls and boys.  Incorrect.  I was *amazed* to discover how

Subject: I: Random thoughts noted on first few weeks in USA

  John, Tom,

  As a recent arrival in the US I have noted some 'features' of life here
  that are purely personal and as you get used to them they cease to be
  noticeable (for example, after I lived in France for a while I was shocked
  on returning to England to find how salty the English food is) so I thought
  I would record these random notes and tyhis is where the collection is up
  to  - if they interest you, use them else dump them.

         Regards

         Roger

    Why do people say hmm-hmm when you thank them - is it not Politically
    Correct  to say "you're welcome/it was nothing" ?

    A recent poll said that what people look for at a food supermarket are
    nutrition ~48% taste ~20% value ~18% 'green' packaging  ~5%. So why do
    so many folk here look malnourished.

    Does no-one want 'green' products ?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Not at a 20 per cent increase in price, a 20 per cent lapse in
        quality and with strong doubts that it's anything more than
        marketing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Why does food (processed, ingredients or served)  have so much added
    sugar ? Even things that do not need it like salsa or fries - I know
    that my palate will stop noticing this pretty soon.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        The sugar is there to counteract all the salt they add.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    I had noticed that fruit lasts longer once you get it home here than it
    did in Europe, then I found out why and I was not too happy. I would
    prefer NOT to have my fruit waxed - even if it is FDA approved wax.

    Why do the media feel they have the right to everything and the
    responsibility for almost nothing - for example

        the person who sneaked Mr. Ashe's medical condition has
        his right to privacy protected by the newspaper, but Mr.
        Ashe...

        the woman on Good Morning America who ONLY wanted to talk
        about a possible new retro virus that has not been
        properly researched but she called it THE NEW FORM OF
        AIDS and she did not want to discuss the other important
        findings at the Amsterdam conference

        the local news giving out the name of a police officer
        involved in a shooting although the Police Department had
        said it would NOT name the officer whilst an
        investigation was underway, THEN the TV interviewed
        people about the individual named !! PHEW talk about
        trial by television.

    Also where are the sources of information and fact ? I do not want the
    kind of news that I get here most of the time - opinions that get set
    out as facts by the pundits on TV - we notice that often the
    commentator speaks over a politician or spokesperson and tells you
    what they are saying - if you can listen to the two at the same time
    you will find there is a often a substantial difference.

    Britain is paying dearly now for some of their pundits' past advice so
    I feel you should watch these pundits - they are the guys who led
    America down the industrial/military route such that you have a huge
    deficit and now don't have anyone to fight with the arms you have
    bought - plus Russia was smart enough to give up the arms race first
    and ask for help from the west. (and no I don't believe they have given
    them up finally and totally)

    Why do so many people who are making propositions here use the 'appeal
    to authority' proof that is philosophically no proof ? For example "in
    his critically acclaimed book Joe Blow says..."

    Why do cars here have such irritating and useless safety features - for
    example cars that lock all doors when you select Drive or pass 5 mph,
    seat belts that nearly cut your head off and do it automatically.
    Whistles to tell you that the key is in the ignition and the seat belt
    is not fastened BUT it goes off after a short time.

    Why is there so much over-engineering of solutions in society general
    as well as the particular - for example on cars a warning buzzer to
    tell you you have left the lights on but have turned off the ignition
    and opened the door - why not just put the lights circuit thru the
    ignition and then the lights go off when the engine goes off (I had
    this feature in 1971 on a Fiat).

    Why are there safety belts in two parts - the lap belt and the diagonal
    belt that have to be dealt with separately ?

    Conversely why don't the majority of cars have handbrakes - as a
    comfort feature not only safety ? (I don't like sitting on the foot
    brake whilst I wait for the lights/crossing gate to change.)

    Why do so many people eat and drink whilst they drive ? I was amazed to
    read a complaint that some $30,000 car did not have a cup holder. (see
    later about self-stressing)

    Conversely it is amazing to see how much improvement there is in
    American Cars (well maybe not - our  Mercury was built in Australia)
    with respect to quality, reliability, design features, and accessories
    included in the price.

    I have driven here for 10 weeks and not felt the need to use the horn
    ONCE - try that in Europe ! I find that driving skills here are higher
    in a larger % of the population. Patience in drivers is higher too.  Is
    it because a driving licence (and a social security number) are
    essential to life here ? Or because you start to train drivers younger
    AND do it very well ? But see later re: self induced stress.

    One thing I do MISS from France is the yellow headlights - they are
    enough to light the road and do not blind you at nights.

    Are the pets of America the best fed in the world  - look at all the
    doggie bags ! How many doggie bags get thrown out unopened 3-7 days
    after the original meal ?

    Why do restaurants serve double size meals ? I am now aware that I have
    to cancel the 'silent fries' that will come with sandwiches but are not
    mentioned in the menu - but I still get caught by the 'silent soup'
    that is a default here in Chicago.
    (I am carrying a penalty for this that is proving hard to lose :-[)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        There's a connection between those double-sized meals and those
        doggie bags.  Write back when you work it out.

    It is quaint to see things marked 'Italian sausage' when as such it
    would not be recognized in Italy and there must be 100's of sausages in
    Italy/Poland etc etc. Likewise English Muffins - as a Brit I do not
    know them at all (forget the advert about Thomas leaving England
    although it is fun). Do other Brits here know them ?

    Why is it that with such a richness of a multi-cultural heritage here
    people are unable to hear and reproduce a different sounding name ?
    Even when I explain how to say my name " gas - coin like the fuel in
    your car and the money you buy it with" I get some weird responses -
    usually gas-cone; how come so few people have no 'ear'.

    Why do rotating light switches  have to be turned twice to operate ?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Easy one.  Those are three-way switches with either one-way bulbs
        or bulbs with the second way burnt out (and therefore also the
        third).

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    In Europe I always thought that the US was at the forefront of equal
    rights for women and for the richness of the melting pot of races - not
    my observation of day to day behaviour here though - women are
    disregarded and racist remarks made that shock me. I am also surprised
    at how many women do not take offence at some of the remarks.

    Aren't people a dream to deal with here ? It has been an absolute
    pleasure to talk to everyone (bar ONE category see later) as a buyer or
    as seller - there is an openness, a willingness to talk about the
    problems and the service we have had as buyers has surprised me and my
    American wife.

    The exception is car salesmen who do not work for Lincoln-Mercury - at
    one point I became so frustrated that the salesman would not leave me
    alone to look at the cars but persisted in trying to 'sell' to me that
    my wife offered to review, select and buy the car so that I would not
    have a heart attack ! The Lincoln-Mercury people were also (continue to
    be) a delight.

    What is the background to the collusion between the people and the
    government that allows the federal/state/city fathers to pass laws that
    are un-enforcable and have no effect on the problem, and yet the people
    allow the politicos to get away with - "we are dealing with the XYZ
    problem".

    Creating a new law that is 'tuned' to deal with one manifestation of a
    problem will only cause the problem to change its appearance to avoid
    the law. For example - (and please forgive my paraphrasing here) it has
    become illegal in Chicago for more than two people who are wearing the
    same coloured clothing to meet together in public. This is supposed to
    deal with the gang problem ?

    Likewise the gun ownership laws - and I know this is a subject of great
    emotion here - but the highest rate of murder takes place in Washington
    DC which has the tightest gun laws. It seems that murderers and drug
    dealers do not take the gun ownership laws seriously - but then why
    would they ..... and why would anyone expect them to ?

    The only crime deterrent that I have seen work in other cultures is a
    high probability that a law breaker will get caught AND be punished.

    I do not know enough about the legal system here but the
    plea-bargaining that I have had explained to me seems not to best serve
    the public's interest nor the integrity of the lawyers.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Here is the theory.  Most are guilty, if not of the exact crime
        they are accused of, of some nearby crime.  Get them to admit it
        and send them to jail at greatly reduced cost.  Nothing I saw in a
        couple of years of covering the Criminal Courts in Chicago has
        ever given me any reason to doubt the theory.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    I have noticed that the vocabulary of the sports world is dominant and
    it limits people's day to day conversations. Sometimes people have
    difficulty in explaining to me the relevance and meaning of a phrase
    they have used for business reasons such as - he has a low rbi - was
    explained as 'poor track record' .

    We are probably close to needing an American-English-American
    dictionary for us Brits, but it was interesting to note that in France,
    more students wanted to learn American than English.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        My Spanish friends, who have lived in both England and the US, say
        American English is much more euphonious than British English.  In
        watching Jeeves and Wooster the other night, with British actors
        doing American accents, it appeared that British actors feel that
        Americans just don't *flute* enough.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    It is often difficult to get an unambiguous explanation - for example -
    what is the house dressing - "oh well its sort of ranch but creamier'
    but what is ranch ?  How far is it to Lake Geneva "oh about an hour to
    an hour and a half" ..........by plane/boat/car/foot ?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        The country is 3000 miles wide, 1500 miles high, with skinty
        skillion people from all over who have been here up to 400 years.
        Things get complicated. "Bangers and mash is just like bubble and
        squeak, except a little more fish and chips."

        Time estimates are always for cars.  We don't walk anywhere.  We
        measure plane time by the length of the flight, plus layovers,
        ignoring the door-to-door time.  Is there still a train to Lake
        Geneva?  I loved the interurban lines of Chicago, the North Shore
        and the South Shore.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    I have never been in place where there are so many adverts on TV for
    anal products - Prep H, Laxatives etc etc - likewise feminine products
    - I think its good marketing to put vinegar and water in a pack and
    sell it at high margin, but how to get away with it ? Maybe because so
    few houses have bidets ?  and why if she has just showered would a
    woman need 'a second deodorant' ?

    .... I am beginning to worry about me for noticing them .....

    Things to kill smells are marketed heavily, and things that smell are
    sold as though they did not - I am amazed how many people say after the
    garlic word is used - 'but not too heavy' or some other deprecating
    phrase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        You just watch a lot of news.  Only old people who are falling
        apart watch the news.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Is there some deep seated recollection of arriving at Ellis Island
    after a ghastly sea journey with no sanitation that has made
    cleanliness a measure of being 'American'

    However, I must say that there were some colleagues in Europe that I
    avoided on hot afternoons and a meeting in a closed conference room
    could be quite a trial there.

    And I was very disappointed when eating pheasant in Colorado - it
    looked and tasted like chicken - it was 'farm-bred to get rid of the
    gamey taste' THAT'S WHAT PHEASANT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE. Also lots
    of people talk of their recipe for venison and how they have 50 steps
    in the process to take away the gamey taste and yet when I ask have
    they eaten venison without this process ? by and large they have not;
    ditto for liver, kidneys and other offal.

    Is this again the Ellis Island relic that eating offal/game reflects a
    past that people want to get way from ?

    How come so many public spokespersons are poor speakers -  for example
    - the Lt. of Coastguard saying they were putting men onto the beached
    QEII to 'maintain the status quo'   OR does the pervasive TV put people
    into situations that are inappropriate but the pressure makes people do
    things they would rather not ?

    Also who said more words were better ? The verbiage really gets to me
    at times. e.g. "at this time" when 'now' would do.  The redundant
    addition of 'ment' as in 'underlayment' The marketing folks really have
    got hold of the language and distorted it - creating verbs out of nouns
    and adding syllables to words that are redundant e.g. 'burglarized'
    when burgled would do.

    (when my wife read this she said - 'UNDERLAYMENT - no you're making
    that up - so I showed her the 84 lumber flier from the local paper)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Is "sub-flooring" intrinsically superior to "underlayment"?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Why does it seem nothing of any importance gets any real attention -
    are people really afflicted with a short attention span ?

    And yet a related item is the overdoing of one subject on TV to the
    exclusion of others - sure Hurricane Andrew is important, but it was
    probably more than 50% of the news this week (26-Aug-1992) and some
    incredible things happened elsewhere (e.g. Israel prepared to talk
    about the Golan Hts with Syria) that have not been reported by the main
    TV channels as far as I can tell. Likewise President Bush reneging on
    the 1982 agreement not to arm Taiwan, and China  getting pissed at him
    and threatening to help arm the middle east was skipped over except on
    Public Radio and the BBC World Service. Many people I have discussed
    this with are unaware of Bush's`decision. BTW it was supposedly to save
    2,000 jobs -I don't think it was worth that NOR do I think that was the
    real goal.

    There is almost no relief in the many TV channels here - I mean the
    main broadcast ones, not the speciality Cable types - the same stuff
    gets re-hashed again and again on Channels 2/5/7/9 so if you get bored
    (again) with the morning show on 5 its no better on 7.

    Why do many people here eat with a napkin permanently ready in one hand
    to wipe their mouths ? Is it part of childhood here or what ?

    There is a serious drugs (advertising) problem here - the over the
    counter drugs kind I mean - it is really quite offputting to have
    ointment for piles advertised when I am eating my breakfast. The
    premise seems to be a total belief in these modern snake oils so that
    people seem to expect to have to take pills be be able to sleep, wake
    up, move around, move their bowels etc etc, and the idea of putting up
    with a minor ache or changing their behaviour as a remedy is by and
    large unthinkable. - There is even the advert for a stomach medicine
    that specifically says 'you may not be able to change your lifestyle
    but you don't have to with .. ....   as the guy guzzles down a
    burger/sub/large fries and drink at his desk.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Again, too much news watching.  And, you don't even like the way
        we do news.  Cut out the news and you'll eliminate a lot of
        annoyance.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    I get many questions like - what is the biggest difference here and
    almost no-one listens to the answer - which is that the population are
    not very well informed.

    One of the encouraging things about Bill Clinton's campaign is that he
    is not allowing  the media to dictate the course of the campaign - he
    keeps on at the economics question and hands off in a good humoured way
    the  media who are hammering away on other questions that he has
    already (in his opinion)  handled; the encouraging thing is that people
    are also getting fed up with the press harping on about the same old
    things

    Conversely Bush and Co have not really being getting a fair crack of
    the whip from the Media - it seems the media love Clinton and don't
    like Bush - whatever the reason there does not seem to be evenness of
    reporting at the moment.

    Recycling is really catching on here and its very well done - no where
    I have lived in Europe did we have a box in which we put all the items
    that can be recycled as we do here. Yet the real concern for the
    environment is missing - for example cheap gas, and the 'jobs before
    spotted owls' movement. I read recently that  the US has 5% of world
    population and consumes about 25% of the non-renewable resources.

    Self-stressing is a habit many people seem to have here - from driving
    too close so they are constantly on and off the brakes to working long
    hours and skipping lunch, to not taking vacations, to freely giving off
    aggressive behaviours when that only stresses the giver ( I was amazed
    at the blue haired woman of 'a certain age' as we say in Europe giving
    me the finger for pulling in front of her in Dallas - she did not have
    to slow down, perhaps I did not know she owned that road ? ) Is the
    differentiation between aggressive and assertive behaviour lost ?

    Are there no diesel fitters here that can correctly set up an engine so
    it does not look as though it burns coal ? - Many trucks here are real
    polluters and yet properly tuned, a diesel is less of a polluter than a
    petrol(gas) engine.

    Its funny to hear Clinton called a 'socialist' and hear that he was
    'infected at Oxford' - the Democrats would not get any kind of a
    rating as Socialists from the left-wing parties in Europe - mind you
    over there the Swedes don't think that France is run by a socialist
    party.

    I see teen-agers being given very little chance by their parents to
    make decisions, or being required to think for themselves - schooling
    seems to be mainly a learn and regurgitate system; I expect to see as a
    consequence to this that the peer pressure increases and there is a
    greater likelihood that drugs or gangs or whatever behaviour will
    spread like wildfire.

I don't expect answers to my questions - some are unanswerable, other
don't need an answer.

and yes ......I do like it here...

I think this is real, although the newsletter editor's name and the

An e-conference to promote communication among scientists working on tits
(Paridae) and other hole-nesting birds
TITNET is the electronic-mail organ of The International Tit Society
(TITS). TITS is an informal, world-wide society formed to promote
communication among scientists working on tits (Paridae) and other
hole-nesting birds whose lifestyle involves biological problems similar to
those of tits, titmice and chickadees. TITS has no dues, no constitution,
no elections and no officers. All work is voluntary on the part of those
who have the time and motivation to help.
Millicent (Penny) Sigler Ficken edits the TITS hardcopy newsletter, PARUS
INTERNATIONAL, which is sent out about twice per year in mid-summer and
mid-winter. Contributions to PARUS INTERNATIONAL may be sent directly to he=

A main function of Titnet is to publish periodically an updated email
address e-conference so that tit workers can contact one another directly.
This listing is called TITNET (full caps), and each posting is cumulative
so that earlier versions may be discarded.
Titnet also has two other kinds of postings. TITNEWS contains announcements
and discussions of activities such as bibliographic systems, and hence
serves as the email newsletter. TITNOTES contains material on the biology
of the birds, and hence serves as a kind of email journal. Postings of
TITNET, TITNEWS, and TITNOTES are numbered serially and separately. A
status check on all three precedes a new posting of any of them, giving a
cumulative e-conference of past postings by number, short title and date of
posting.
Persons wishing to be added to the Titnet email address e-conference should
send a message to:

    POST-INDUSTRIAL SABOTAGE

    From "Sabotage in the American Workplace," a collection of first-person
    accounts of workplace "mischief and revenge" that "provides new insight
    into attitudes toward work by redefining sabotage as a common and
    significant aspect of the American work experience."  The book, which

      I worked as the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank on
    Capitol Hill.  It's a group of attorneys, columnists, whatever, who
    crank out -- daily or weekly or whatever -- information.  It's printed
    downstairs, in the Xerox room, and distributed to senators,
    congressmen, and other influential people.  In a couple of cases, I
    delivered packages to Ed Meese; that gives you an idea of what kind of
    people work there.  My basic duties were to collect mail in the
    mornings from the post office, sort it, and distribute it.  I pretty
    much did everything by myself, and I had a lot of responsibility.
      I got the job right after high school.  I had never heard of the
    organization and just found the job through the newspaper.  When I was
    working there, I would occasionally glance at what they were putting
    out; the more I read, the more I thought about it and realized they
    were doing fucked-up things, like defending business practices in South
    Africa and US investments there.
      They have a big fund-raising deal, and when they sent out
    fund-raising requests, people would mail in checks.  Sometimes they'd
    be huge amounts, and sometimes they were piddling.  Checks came in from
    individuals as well as from companies.  So I started opening them, and
    throwing the checks in the shredder.  I started doing it more and more.
    I could tell if it was a check by holding it up to the light.  If it
    was, I'd toss it or shred it.
