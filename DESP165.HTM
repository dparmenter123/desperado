Obviously the stock market crash (oops, *correction*) has had a more or less
sobering effect on the parishioners. You have a few things on your mind this
month. You are thinking about Wall Street (did anybody see the movie, or
did it close Oct. 19?), you are thinking about the RISKS forum, and you
are thinking about dumping on lawyers. I like it better when you're just
hungry.

You're a jittery crowd, kids, but let's see if we can't lighten up to a
certain extent:

Below is Dale McFeatter's (Scripps-Howard Service) guide to Wall Street.

Company: An organization identified by three letters - CSX,MCI,ATT,TRW, - that
issues stock.  The less the name says about the company, the better its stock,
which is why U.S. Steel changed its name to USX.

Broker: A firm named after two people who have no connection with the
organization - Merrill,Lynch; Smith,Barney; Kidder,Peabody; Drexel,Lambert -
that buys and sells stock.  If you phone and ask for Mr. Merrill, the
receptionist will think you're a smart-aleck.  Brokerages are never named
Stocks 'N' Bonds 'R' Us, Investment City, McShares or Shirley's House of Puts.

Blue Chip Stock: An investment in which the dealer is required to draw another
card at 16 and stand pat at 17.

Speculative Stock: An investment on which you win if it closes at 7 or 11, but
lose if it comes up 2,3, or 12.  The technical term for this last among market
specialists is "craps".

Commodities: An investment instrument on which you can't lose.  You either
make money or you win boxcars full of prizes - pork bellies, corn gluten,
steel scrap, and lard.

NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ: The three evil dwars in Wagner's "Gotterdammerung" who
sing the haunting leitmotif of financial schadenfreude generally translated by
scholars as "I should Have Got Out of the Market Last Week".

Options: A financial instrument that allows investors to put their money into
the equivalent of sports betting.  Basically, the investor is risking his
money on whether a stock will or will not cover a point spread.  In Oklahoma
vs. Kansas State, the bulls were saying that the Sooners would beat the
Wildcats by more than 56 points; the bears were taking Kansas State.  As
everybody knows, it was a weekend for bears and Kansas State covered the
spread, losing 59-10.
    Reflecting market realities, the spread on Nebraska vs. Kansas State
dropped to 54 points.  Put and call options allow you to bet major companies
and give or get points.

Programmed trading: When computers buy and sell stocks based on anomalies in
the market.  These are the same computers that bill your 87-year-old
grandmother for $155,000 worth of high-intensity weight-lifting equipment and
send her leaflets offering a lifetime membership in Club Med.

Translating the technical language of Wall Street:

"The market is undergoing a five-year technical adjustment." (The market
crashed.)

"This is not the time for the small investor to get out of the market."
(Sell.)

"Put your money in T-bills, gold, and safe deposit boxes." (Buy.)

"Don't panic." (Panic.)

"Above all, stay calm." (Stockpile water and canned goods in the basement.)

"The underlying economy is sound." (Better lay in some M-16's and plenty of
small-arms ammunition with the canned goods.)

                               "A New Twist"

        During the past few months, the BCS's Telecommunications Group has been
trying to develop a viable alternative to the FCC's proposal to impose a tariff
on computer data networks.  The group's work has received so much national
attention that the congressional committee that oversees the FCC has asked the
BCS to testify before Congress.
        The BCS is concerned, however, because our nonprofit, tax-exempt status
limits our ability to engage in activities that might be considered political
lobbying.  If the IRS feels that we have stepped outside our educational
mission, it could threaten to revoke the Society's charitable status.
        Thus, when the director of the BCS's Telecommunications Group was told
a few days ago that an agent from the IRS had phoned and was waiting on hold to
speak with him, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.
        "I'd like to speak with you about your work on the FCC proposal," the
agent told our director.
        An ominous silence followed.
        "Yes," our director replied.
        "The IRS is the largest user of one of the leading data networks.  If
this proposal goes through, we're going to get hurt badly.  We could really use
the BCS's help."

Mention of Constitutional intent in the last issue reminded me of a piece
I wrote a little while ago.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

                      AN ACTUARIAL AMENDMENT

                      by Kenneth B. Sherman
                   -------------------------

It's time we took a close look at the implicit content of the
Constitution and did what the Founders would have wanted --
disenfranchise most of the voting population and ensure that second
terms of office are rare.

Recently, the news has carried stories of certain congressmen and other
citizens who wish the 22nd Amendment repealed -- thus permitting the
President to once again run for more than two terms. These stories note
that this is hardly an unreachable short-term goal, since the 26th
Amendment was ratified by the states in just four months in 1971 to give
18-year-olds the vote.

That got me to thinking. The Constitution originally gave the vote to
(men) over 21. Not so unrealistic, you say? Well, in 1787, the life
expectancy of the average US male citizen was just 35. So, at 21, a man
could look forward to just 14 years of voting before being overtaken by
death. Another way of looking at it is that a man had to have lived 60%
of his life before being given the vote. By today's standards, a man
would not be enfranchised until the age of 43 (for the sake of
simplicity, let's overlook a woman's longer life expectancy).

Forty-three. Think about it. And carry it a step further. The
Constitution also requires that a member of Congress be at least 25; a
Senator be at least 30; and the President be at least 35. In terms of
1787, that meant that all members of Congress would have to have
(statistically, anyway) at least one foot in the grave, and that the
President would statistically already be in the grave, although perhaps
still stubbornly holding on to the rim. A four year term would be a real
flirtation with the actuarial tables.

To me, this says something real and important about the intentions of
the writers of the Constitution. For one, it implies that they wanted no
part of professional politicians -- men in the larger-than-life (if
slightly cracked) mold of Tip O'Neill, who spent their entire lives as
professional politicians -- lives twice as long as those of their
counterparts in 1787. Tip O'Neill has been in Congress about as long as
the entire New England delegation of the First and Second Congresses.
Gives you something to think about. For the writers seem to have clearly
envisioned elected representatives as people who spend a part of their
senior years helping guide the United States from the perspective of
their personal experience as businessmen, farmers, physicians, tradesmen,
what have you. The idea of a professional, 40 year politician seems
to have been as alien to them as a bear at a tea party.

So, let's update the Constitution for advances in science and nutrition.
Keeping in the spirit of the Founding Parentpersons, I propose that the
Constitution be amended as follows: minimum age for Congressmen: 54;
for Senators: 64; and for President: 75.

Outrageous, you say? Not really, when you also change the voting age to
39 (43, corrected for the intent of the 26th Amendment). Now you'd have
a government with special assets: men and women who had held actual,
real jobs, rather than having spent their entire adult lives slurping at
the federal feeding trough. there would hardly be Congressmen and Senators
who parked it in Congress for 30, 40, 50 years; Officer Grim Reaper would
be constantly patroling the halls and would hardly allow such loitering.
And the 22nd Amendment would be an oxymoron.

Of course, you make one improvement, other problems may crop up. By
disenfranchising everyone under 39, you'd have the curious phenomenon of
an entire sub-class of people who were out there working and raising
families who could not take part directly in the electoral process.
Well, no system is perfect, and such a subservient role might well do to
teach these young whippersnappers a little respect for both the system
and their elders. They'd get their turn.

The advantages of such a change would be several:

* Elimination of sex as an issue in Presidential politics (hey; how many
  75-year-olds screw around?)

* Keeping guys like Kennedy and Markey out of Congress until they grew
  up

* Rightfully disenfranchising yuppies (who are, by definition, under
  40); no one who owns two BMWs deserves to vote in this country anyway

* Taking college kids out of the voting booth and putting them back in
  menial, low-paying jobs, where they belong

* Finally, almost guaranteeing that no President would serve more than
  one term (thereby limiting the mischief any Chief Executive could get
  into)

So there it is. A plan to ensure that the intent of the Writers not be
despoiled by the cynical interference of health and other scientific
progress. But we have to work quickly. It takes time to get referendum
signatures.

"The sexing of day-old chicks has been regarded as an extrodinarily
difficult perceptual task requiring years of extensive practice for its
master.  Experts can sex chicks at over 98% accuracy at a rate of 1,000
chicks per hour [Naive subjects were asked to sex chicks, and did it
badly.  Then they were given some instructions, collected by
interviewing the experts, and the subjects did much better, going from
0.21 accuracy to 0.82 accuracy.] A parallel is drawn between learning
to sex chicks and learning to classify tanks as friends of foe."

Subj:   USENET sci.research newsgroup articles

        The latest issue of OMNI magazine (November 1987, page 72+) has an
article on how to make your very own batch of Y1Ba2Cu3Ox liquid-nitrogen
superconductor. To make "123", as it's called, combine 1 part yttrium oxide,
2 parts barium carbonate, and 3 parts copper oxide. Grind to powder, bake at
900-950C for 12 hours. Cool in kiln, regrind, and compress the powder at
15000-18000 pounds in a hydraulic press. Rebake in oxygenated kiln, let cool
very slowly (minimum 8 hours). You now have a fragile superconductor which
crumbles on absorbing moisture.
        As author Bruce Schecter points out:
        "Please remember, recipes are rarely complete. The experienced chef
knows this and fills in missing steps unconsciously. The same is true of
laboratory recipes. The consequences of mistakes in the kitchen are only
unpalatable; laboratory mistakes can be dangerous, or even deadly. So have a
professional, such as a [good] science teacher, in the room while work is
being done."
        Three other notes:
        1) This was reproduced without permission, and so I had to leave
out some of the details of acquisition of materials and machines. I suggest
that anyone interested in this sort of project buy up an issue of OMNI with
this article, order a reprint, or in some like manner acknowledge Mr.
Schecter's good work.
        2) Caltech has the capacity to do this project, perhaps in conjunction
with the Secondary Students Project. As Mr. Schecter notes, this is one of the
best ways to incite the next generation to learn about science: hands-on
participation.
        3) A resounding "Amen" to the laboratory dangers warning: in my frosh
lab we made chips with 'large' transistors. The photoresist only smelled bad;
the hydrogen fluoride etch was the real nightmare-producer: the only thing
worse than one HF spill on a person would be one HF spill which was neither
washed thoroughly nor neutralized by calcium compound injections.
        On a similar note, an acquaintance in high school built a working model
of a volcano using gunpowder. He tried looking into it to see if the cycle was
starting. Luckily my sister kept her head when the thing spread itself over the
room: he kept his eyes thanks to that.

         For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped
     to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer
     be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which "c" would be retained
     would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2
     might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the
     same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with
     "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.

places  the food to be processed. The door to the box, like the box itself,
is completely opaque.

On  the  outside of each box is a general description of what the box does.
For  instance,  one box might say: "Makes anything a meal"; another: "Cooks
perfectly every time"; another: "Never more than 100 calories a serving".
You  can  never  be  exactly  sure what happens to food when it is placed in
these  boxes.  They  don't work with the door open, and the 200-page user's
manual doesn't give any details.

Working  in  a  kitchen  would  be  a  matter of becoming familiar with the
idiosyncrasies of a small number of these boxes and then trying to get done
what you really want done using them. For instance, if you want a fried-egg
sandwich,  you  might try the "Makes anything a meal" box, since a sandwich
is  a sort of meal. But because you know from past experience that this box
leaves  everything  coated  with grease,  you  use  the "Never more than 100
calories"  box  to  postprocess  the output. And so on. the result is never
what you really want, but it is all you can do.

You  aren't allowed to look inside the boxes to help you do what you really
want  to do. Each box is sealed in epoxy. No one can break the seal. If the
box  seems  to  not  be  working  right,  there is nothing you can do. Even
calling  the manufacturer is no help, because the box is not under warranty
to be for for any particular purpose. The manufacturers do have help lines,
but  not  for  help with broken boxes--rather to help you figure out how to
use  functioning  boxes.  But  don't  try  to  ask  how your box works. The
help-line people don't know, or if they do, they won't tell you.

Several  times a year you get a letter from the manufacturer telling you to
ship  them your old box and they will send you a new one. If you do so, you
find  yourself  with  a  shinier  box,  which does whatever it did before a
little  faster,  or perhaps it does a little more--but since you were never
sure what it did before, you  cannot be sure it's better now.

Subj:   Standing up for the Banana

    [From an August 26 letter to Bruce Christensen, president of
    PBS, from Robert M. Moore, president of the International
    Banana Association. Moore is writing to protest a program on
    AIDS scheduled for broadcast on WETA, the Washington, DC,
    public-television station, on November 6.]

    Dear Mr. Christensen,

    In this program, a banana is used as a substitute for a human
    penis in a demonstration of how condoms should be used.

    I must tell you, Mr. Christensen, as I have told
    representatives of WETA, that our industry finds such usage
    of our product to be totally unacceptable. The choice of a
    banana rather than some other inanimate prop constitutes
    arbitrary and reckless disregard for the unsavory association
    that will be drawn by the public and the damage to our
    industry that will result therefrom.

    The banana is an important product and deserves to be treated
    with respect and consideration. It is the most extensively
    consumed fruit in the United States, being purchased by over
    98 percent of households. It is important to the economies of
    many developing Latin American nations. The banana's
    continued image in the minds of consumers as a healthful and
    nutritious product is critically important to the industry's
    continued ability to be held in such high regard by the
    public and to discourage its responsibilities to its Latin
    American hosts.

    Unfortunately, WETA categorically refused my request to view
    the offensive sequence, citing policies by PBS.

    Mr. Christensen, I have no alternative but to advise you that
    we intend to hold PBS fully responsible for any and all
    damages sustained by our industry as a result of the showing
    of this AIDS program depicting the banana in the
    associational context planned. Further, we reserve all legal
    rights to protect the industry's interests from this
    arbitrary, unnecessary, and insensitive action.

                                        Very truly yours,
                                        Robert M. Moore

Subj:   Speaking of using Children to hold down Garbage [#1152] . . .

On CBS radio news today I heard the following tantalizing but brief
report.

   - Several years ago, one of our ICBMs at an installation in
     Wyoming signaled to its local command center that it was initiating
     launch procedures (which had by no means been requested).

   - Wishing to forestall an actual launch, the crew parked a heavy
     armoured vehicle atop the silo. The report did not indicate
     exactly what outcome this was expected to produce, or whether
     the driver remained in the vehicle. Evidently no launch did
     in fact take place.

   - The crew did not think it necessary to report the above events
     (in real or delayed time) to SAC command headquarters or anyone
     else off site. These events have come to be known only recently
     by some fortuitous means.

This strikes me as rather disquieting, if not macabre. I am not sure
whether to be most disturbed by i) the independent-mindedness of the
missle (a trait not virtuous in such objects), ii) the method
available to the crew to interupt the undesired process, or 3) the
fact that they found what happened too insignificant (let us hope not
due to its being common) or too embarassing to report.

Toronto Globe and Mail, 3 November 1987.

Computer systems hit by `logic bombs'
-------------------------------------

A disgruntled employee of a London Ontario company recently planted
a surprise in the corporation's computer - a ``logic bomb,'' which
would, on a certain date, knock out the entire system.  It was found
in time and the man was prosecuted ``but it would have destroyed
their complete computer system - it would have been down for months,''
Sergeant Ted Green of the Ontario Provincial Police said yesterday.
The London man who planted the ``logic bomb'' ... was later acquitted
of the crime ... the trial judge refused to admit evidence of a
previous ``bomb'' he had allegedly planted in a computer system of an
Alberta company because the firm had refused to press charges.

In another case involving a Toronto company, a similar ``logic bomb''
was activated the day the employee's termination notice was
processed in the computer system.  ``It wiped out the whole system,'',
said Sgt. Green, ... a specialist in computer crime.

In another case Sgt. Green worked on, a bank branch decided on the
occasion of its 10th anniversary to honor the customer who had the
most active account.  It turned out to be an employee who had
accumulated $70,000 funnelling a few cents out of every account into
his own.  ``He said: `Go ahead and charge me.  I will tell the public
you have been doing this for years.'  It was true.  The bank had been
rounding off (customers') accounts and putting them into sundry
accounts.''

Subject: Computer usage by Solidarity in Poland
Date: 10 Nov 87 19:31:54 GMT

This is a sketch of the article, ``Of Systems, Solidarity, and
Struggle'' in Datamation, 1 November 1987.

  ``You know why there are so few sophisticated computer
terrorists in the United States?  Because your hackers have so
much mobility into the establishment.  Here, there is no such
mobility.  If you have the slightest bit of intellectual
integrity you cannot support the government.... That's why the
best computer minds belong to the opposition.''  - Anonymous

This opens a good article on how computers are being used by the
opposition in Poland.  Go find a copy of Datamation and read it.

Solidarity is now becoming computerized.  Computers are used to
write articles, track election fraud, maintain organizations, and
maintain communications.  Using computers for such illegal
purposes is not without penalties.  Typical sentences for
opposition activities are 1-2 years when the crimes are
non-violent.

The government has focused its efforts on severing the
communications that make opposition efforts effective.  When they
initially severed the public telephone system, computer
operators used internal private line systems to maintain
communications.  With martial law, these too were shut down.  Now
the primary modes of communication are either by mail or by
courier.  A floppy disk is easy to hide in a package or carry
unobtrusively.

Personal computers are now widespread in Poland, acquired both
legally and by smuggling.  There are an estimated 500,000
personal computers in Poland, with Sinclair and Amstrad being the
most popular.  There are an estimated 700 illegal publications
being generated by everything from matrix printers to
laserwriters.  Nearly two thirds of the non-violent crime in
Poland is associated with illegal press and opposition
activities.

The government has had to choose between the serious economic
damage that would result from eliminating computers and their
elimination as an opposition tool.  So far, they have been forced
to allow the continued use of computers.

The security capabilities of computers are also important to
Solidarity.  Telephone calls can be traced and monitored; floppy
disks are easy to smuggle around.  Paper is very bulky, hard to
conceal, and hard to destroy.  Floppies are very compact, easy to
hide, easy to encrypt, and easy to destroy.

``Every Solidarity center had piles and piles of paper ....
everyone was eating paper and a policeman was at the door.  Now
all you have to do is bend a disk.''

Subj:   Origins of the word blurb

"blurb -- In a lifetime of reading the puffery on book jackets
we may never have stopped to think about the origin of blurb,
the term for this kind of prose.  *Blurb*, in fact, does not come
to us from another language, nor does it go back to an Indo-European root.
The American humorist, illustrator, and author
Gelett Burgess coined blurb in the early 1900's.  He did so on a
book jacket meant to be comic that he designed for his book
Are You A Bromide? (first published in 1906).  The cover pictured
a well-endowed young woman whom Burgess christened Miss Belinda Blurb.
Burgess himself had these words to say about blurb in 1914:
"On the 'jacket' of the 'latest' fiction, we find the blurb;
abounding in agile adjectives and adverbs, attesting that this book
is the sensation of the year."  Although we are indebted to Burgess for
*blurb*, it is a pity that we could not also have kept some of his
other coinages, including *oofle,*  "a person whose name you cannot
remember," and *tintiddle*,"a witty retort, thought of too late."

"Tintiddle" indeed! What's wrong with "l'esprit d'escalier" -- the
inspiration that strikes you when you are on the staircase leaving the party?

Daedalus is one of my favorite book catalogs. It appears to be governed
by an undisciplined and voracious intelligence, which is my *favorite*
flavor.

And I've never investigated the truth of this allegation, but one of the
blurbs on my husband's current book, The Art of War by Sun Tzu, is signed

Subj:   Book Review

Sierra Magazine, September/October 1987:

 Iowa biologist Roger M Knutson has produced a parody of the familiar nature
guide - and of the naturalist who holds it. "Much of our usual appreciation
of an animal-in any condition-depends on our ability to identify and name it,"
writes Knutson in 'Flattened Fauna: A field Guide to Common Animals of Roads,
Streets, and Highways' (Ten Speed Press, 1987.) "For flattened fauna, however,
that can be a problem. Most of these animals have been pressed to the road
for several days and may have assumed unrecognizable shapes.. This guide is
meant to answer the oft-asked question, 'That wasn't a dog or a cat -- what
was it?'"
 Animal species commonly found run over by cars and trucks are listed for
identification in four groupings: road snakes, legged reptiles and amphibians,
road birds, and road mammals. Knutson's text, which is accompanied by
silhouettes of the flattened animals, describes the habits (when living) and
markings (when dead) of the various species.
 Knutson suggests that, in the interest of safety, the guide not be used by the
solitary driver. And he notes that since the average observation time is about
5 seconds, identification will be difficult even with a copilot. "Better to
know that a particular specimen is possibly a vole," he cautions, "than to be
certain it is 'Microtus pennsylvanicus' and join it on the road."
