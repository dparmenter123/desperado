                        ESCAPE SEQUENCE GETAWAY

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Yes, it's true, mailmen (and mailwomen), there's no getting away from
it, the escape sequence is only a shadow of its former self ... at
least on VMS (itself a shadow of its former self, i.e. RSX).  Some
shadowy figure has decreed,

                NO MORE ESCAPE SEQUENCES IN VMS MAIL!

One theory is that this shadowy figure is one of those managers whose
software skills are concentrated in the mail-user area and who was the
victim of one letter-bomb too many.  Or, maybe one of those economical
managers still using the flutter-bell  VT52 who hates ending up in
in-the-weeds mode just because some joker wants to hi-lite his memos.
Or, perhaps it's a Desperado who just got tired of typing CTRL/Z and
flicking the on-off switch (the 0/1 switch to all you
internationalizers) to cure some jagged trick of mine.  It doesn't
matter anyway.  From this day forth all escapes shall appear as a
simple $.  There is a way to get the escapes back though.  See next
item.

The Latin phrase means something like HONOUR and DEFENSE (literally).
There are other possible meanings, since DECUS can mean "glory," and
TUTAMEN in thus context could mean "strong resistance" or "rebuff".
Anyway, I think "HONOUR and DEFENSE" would probably be the standard
translation...

Hope this answers your question.

Interesting that the latter correspondent spelled honor like a Brit, but
defence like a Gringo.

My heartiest support and congratulations to OBLIO::CROLL for coming up with
the much-needed RELIEF FUND FOR EX-SYSTEM MANAGERS, as documented in #1045!
As an ex-system manager for one 11/70 and 2 11/44's running various and sun-
dry M and M+ (and, *gasp* even IAS!!!!) systems in the TSC in Colorado
Springs, I am now just a hollow (well, maybe not quite hollow, still over
200 lbs) shell of my former self.  Privileged tasks to the left of me! Over-
zealous users to the right of me!  Managers wanting privileged accounts all
over me!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhgggggggggggggg!

Well, maybe life isn't all that bad--I've found myself an 11/34 in a corner
of the computer room, where I can spend the rest of my days hunched over an
LA36 doing sysgens and chuckling quietly to myself...

While we're on the subject of Information Systems News and its cloudy crystal
ball, getta loada this. I don't know about the Whole Earth stuff, but it looks
like editing and researching for this particular rag is EEEEEEEEEEEE-ZEE money!

P.S. Needless, I suppose, to say that nosotros desesperados may be res-
ponsible for this shocking breach of Security; on the other hand, all the talk
I've seen about the products in Desperado was much more accurate than this is.
They should get the facts from you, Tom--hey, waitaminnit, did they??? Is that
where you and Desperado have been for so long? At any rate, as Reid Brown sez,
great PR. (He also means that this makes it a little easier to tell the truth
to a [very] select few; please continue to keep new product information 'close
to your vest' [sorry about the sexism, ladies, they said it!].)

P.P.S. True/false status is shown in brackets, by paragraph, in case this is
too subtle for some people. Note, interestingly, that much of the mis-
information stems from their assumption that every apparently or logically
related effort at DEC is ACTUALLY related, e.g., SUVAX and MicroVAX. They don't
seem to know how "decentralized" (to put it kindly) DEC is.

P.P.P.S. This also reminds me of something I've been meaning to submit for the
Life Imitates Art Department. The name being considered for the
Seahorse end-user system is MicroVAX 610. And in case you think there's a
rationale behind such decisions, lemme tell yuh: An equally mendacious trade
journal published a "leak article" like this one a few months ago; they
described a totally fictitious thing that they chose to call a VAX 610. So that
name seemed like the line of least resistance once DEC actually did cook up
something. For similarly sound reasons, there's now some talk about adding
another zero and making it "6100." Rewritin'em up, here, boss?

DEC Readies desk-Top, PC Versions of VAX Mini

        Digital Equipment Corp is putting the finishing touches on
a new 32-bit desk-top version of the VAX minicomputer that will
anchor the VAX lines' low end, sources said last week.
[TRUE]

        A companion product, a personal computer based
on a single 32-bit VAX compatible chip, is also said to be under development.
[TRUE, kinda, we hope somebody will...]

        Known as Seahorse, the low-end minicomputer will be available
in two versions, for end users and OEM's, and is reportedly under beta
test at several large DEC customer sites, including AT &amp; T.  Third-party
software houses are already working on general business applications
software for the new VAX, although some have said they have yet to see
the hardware demonstrated.
[TRUE, except for field-test and application software info]

Although DEC has mentioned its intention to market such a system,
company officials have said little about its specifications, even
to third-party houses and potential customers.  Many said DEC was
playing Seahorse specs 'close to the vest' in an effort to ward off
look-alikes from the DEC-compatible industry.
[TRUE, making you wonder how they found this stuff out. However,
it probably would be a good thing if our competitors actually tried copying
what this article describes.]

        .......

        The end-user version of Seahorse could perform at rates
as high as 0.5 MIPS, although the machines speed is said to vary widely
according to application and the number of terminals supported.
[Could be. After all, we'd miss the 32-bit-machine-of-the-month sweepstakes in
Computerworld; this is so people can continue to announce things that
are random_integer*VAX performance.]

Seahorse's real time operating system, called Seaborg [sic], is
written in Pascal, and will not run the VAX/VMS operating system
without conversion.  OEM's are expected to write the conversion
themselves, but DEC will make the conversion for the end user product.
[Har, har. Why didn't we think of that name? A cyborg love-goddess
that rose out of the foam when we spilled our seed in Puget Sound,
or did it come out of Dave's side? This is all bullshit. Let's
face it, only Subject Matter Experts understand software.]
        .....

        The commercial market will be key to the Seahorse's success, one
third-party source said, because the commercial market is dollar-sensitive,
and not throughput-sensitive.  The system will run general business software
well, but may be too slow for some scientific and engineering applications.
[FALSE, really. But who knows? Maybe the commercial market is the key to
every product's success nowadays. Seahorse oughta do well there, anyway.]

        The new VAX is based on a two-chip set which was completed about
six months ago, according to a memo circulated within DEC.
[FALSE; probably a confusion of products, a confused memo, or maybe they're
just lying.]

        A single-chip
version of the Seahorse chip set will be the basis for the new
32-bit personal computer.
[TRUE, maybe, kinda, ...]

        The end user version of Seahorse, packaged with 256k bytes of memory,
a 10 Mbyte Winchester disk, dual floppy drives, and a chassis including
six extra expansion slots, would cost $14,600.  An expanded version,
with memory of 1 Mbyte, the RD51 hard disk, the RX50 floppy disk drive
and an Ethernet controller would cost $20,000.  A third version, with
a 50 Mbyte hard disk would cost $28,700.  The actual production cost
of the Seahorse board is said to be $1,600, but OEM prices were not
available.
[CLOSE...I mean, it's 4 slots, but what are a few slots among friends? Prices
may not be too far off. Maybe I should call them and ask whether they've
decided what microvms and Seaboard should cost to go with this....]

        Announcement is expected in the fourth quarter, possibly December,
which sources said represented months of delay from an introduction
date planned for this summer.  Deliveries would begin in 1984.  Among
the missing elements is the computer system's disk controller, which
is now being modified at a DEC facitlity in Colorado.
[FALSE.]
        ..... several paragraphs about SUVAX .....

        The introductions of Seahorse and the Suvax have been delayed by
production problems, which have plagued both products, sources confided.
Design engineers reportedly had trouble building a Seahorse prototype.
They abandoned that effort in favor of designing the 32-bit chip sets
from simulations of the VAX operating system that were done on large
DEC mainframes.
[FALSE! There have been no Seahorse problems of significance. ]

        The VAX operating system had to be modified slightly
[***EEEOOO**Just a little softwa reengineering, GI. Later, TR***] for the new
minicomputer, while two large scale integrated (LSI) chips were needed
just to contain all the circuits necessary to support the existing
VAX software.  The simulation process, new to DEC, is reportedly also being
used to develop the Suvax 32-bit chip.
[Gee, I love that kinda talk! What'd ah say 'bout software?]

        The 32-bit chip development was considered to be so
critical to DEC's marketing plan that a seperate Seattle design facility
was set up, headed by David Cutler.
[Basically, this is false; came here ta do software; got innarested in
hardware later.]

        The Seattle facility, known internally as DECwest, took over after
initial attempts to prototype the Seahorse chip at Hudson failed.  A DEC
facility in Santa Clara, Calif., was said to have assisted in the
simulation that aided the chip's development.  The Seahorse chip set's
manufacture has reportedly been farmed out to SEEQ Technology, Inc.,
San Jose.
[FALSE; maybe more confusion of projects, since we never prototyped
anything that didn't work nor did we prototype anything in Hudson]

     I recently won (yes, won!) a Commodore 64, which I am discovering is
     a real macho machine for real programmers. For example, the most used
     instructions if you use B*S*C are PEEK and POKE.  If anyone out there
     owns one, and has fathomed out how to switch memory banks for user-

Having enjoyed lists about Real Men, Real Programmers, Real Applications
Programmers (a radically different breed of bitpusher), and Real Millrats, I
submit the following list of things Real Engineers do and don't do.  It is, of
course, by no means exhaustive, but it's a start.

Real Engineers write their own utilities with DCL .COM files.

Real Engineers use TECO because they like it.

Real Engineers wear socks that match their shirts.  When they wear shirts.

Real Engineers avoid Spit Brook.

Real Engineers don't care what's at the bottom of the mill pond.

Real Engineers have libraries of chip catalogs in their offices.

Real Engineers have full VMS manual sets, but they're still sealed in plastic.

Real Engineers appreciate Bill the Cat.

Real Engineers have their own espresso machines, but they let somebody else
pay for them.

Real Engineers know where a PDP-8I disk interface mounts.

Real Engineers drive Volvos or Hondas but they don't fix them when they break.

Real Engineers think 'support' and 'testability' are four-letter words.

Real Engineers smoke in no-smoking areas.  After they steal the no-smoking
signs.

Real Engineers buy time with cache.

Real Engineers don't change printer ribbons.  Ever.  They wait for Real
Programmers to do it.

Real Engineers have megabytes of memory but forget their wives' birthdays.

Real Engineers don't like diesels.  They prefer steam.

Real Engineers don't blanch at mention of Tewksbury.  But they don't work
there, either.

Real Engineers make many careful measurements.  Then they go with what feels
right.

Real Engineers aren't touch typists.  And they don't care.

Real Engineers don't build breadboards.  They let the chips fall where they
may.

Real Engineers have wire-wrapped Apples at home.  Or maybe wire-wrapped
PDP-11/04s...
