I have heard a few folks lately affirm the arrival of Spring based on
some singular observation like seeing the first robin, or feeling
drunk with Spring fever.  Last evening I was in a slight reverie at
the sight of a long overdue sunset of the deepest rosie hues.  That, I
was sure was my personal confirmation that winter was over.  Wrong.
While driving home, still blissed out on the weather, it came to me...
SPLATT!!!  on the winshield.  The first major insect casualty of the
year.  Now I KNOW it's Spring.

Anyone else out there have any unique indicators?

Well, speaking for myself, I was once 20 years old, walking across the
Purdue campus with an actual published poet, marvelling at the arrival
of spring in the flat Hoosier state, when whang-o, a squirrel shit on
me.

Now that I'm older, I look for potholes.

Ah, beisbol! It must truly be time to stow the down jacket, for lo!
the Red Sox are tied for last place, the Eck was yeck, it's all right
to hate the Yankees again - hell, it's obligatory for any civilized
human - and DESPERADO is throwing Grantland Rice balls.

Now, we all know that the greatest living baseball writer is Roger
Angell. (Gammons is pretty good when he gets cranked up, and Thomas
Boswell - the leading propounder of the Total Average statistic - can
hum it at times, too.) However, there is also Bill James.

Bill James is a sabretician. The SABR comes from Society for American
Baseball Research (or something). He often publishes ingenious pieces
in SPORT or ESQUIRE or other magazines, arguing with elaborate
statistics that Duane Kuiper is the worst ball player in the majors,
or that Dicke Thon is a better shorstop than Ozzie Smith. (Yep.) Very
elegant statistics, and pretty reasonable ratings of teams and players
(Dickie Thon, notwithstanding). Last year James published his
sabremetrics (or whatever) in a book called THE BASEBALL ABSTRACT. You
might still find a copy of this (Ballentine pb, large format) in some
bookstores. Highly recommended. Recently, Ballentine published the
1983 BASEBALL ABSTRACT - less sarcastic about Kuiper, and other
reincarnations of Don Buddin, but still very funny and very precise.
Highly highly highly highly recommended. Hope it's going to be an
annual event. James also mentions that he might start a newsletter...

Want to know to what extent the Red Sox averages are boosted by
Fenway? Whether some stadium is a pitcher's park or a hitter's park?
Whether the stolen base is a better offensive weapon than, I dunno,
power hitting? James has measured all these things, with reasonable
objectivity and care. How good a shortstop was/is Larry Bowa? How much
was he helped by Mike Schmidt's range at third? James has calculated
range factors for fielders. What pitchers are unlucky? James has
calculated DP support for pitchers. Does John Tudor balk too much?
More than Carlton? James has counted 'em up and evaluated the costs
and benefits of balks and pick-offs. Is Al Oliver an over-rated
braggart or a unrecognized superstar? Unanswerable; but James has
figured out his, and others', chances of 3000 hits.

I live in near infamy these days as Spring and the softball season
approach.  I know about neatsfoot oil.  It was originally developed by
a Doctor (Neat by name) to treat horses' hooves when they dried out.

I couldn't find any neatsfoot oil at the time so I tried linseed oil.
I checked out the naptha suggestion.  A guy who works in a saddlery
said it would dry out the leather.  Suggestions for lighter fluid,
turpentine and other potentially caustic solvents went by the boards
because the glove sutffing absorbs all that stuff and would slowly
seep it back out onto the skin of my hand as I used the mitt.

I learned a lot about it.  Mostly, I learned that I need a new glove.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I like the derivation of neatsfoot oil, but my dictionary says neat
are cattle and the oil is made from their feet.

Subject: Tahitian Madness

From the Miami Herald recently came this excerpt about Tahitian life:

"You can't motivate Tahitians with money, with promotions or with
social recognition... They work only for fun and love.

"My best gardener had worked (at the Beachcomber Hotel) for nine
years," (the manager) said. "Then one day he failed to show up. When I
asked about him, his fellow workers said, 'Oh, he fiu.' Fiu is hard to
translate, but it means bored or fed up with whatever you're doing.

"My gardener went fiu, but after a few months he came back. You can't
stay fiu for too long, and he finally got fiu from being fiu. That's
Tahiti!."

Just to make sure guests don't misinterpret Tahiti and Tahitians the
Royal Tahitian Hotel spells it out for you in a notice in the room:

"So that we may serve you in the fashion you would like, we wish to
bring to your attention a few facts. In Tahiti, 'work' is not
considered very important, and for this reason, we do not always
achieve the goals that we aim for."

(No wonder I liked Tahiti!)

I have always suspected that lovers of literary morsels also go for
the real thing. So this is a piece of FOOD NEWS!

In Hudson, Massachusetts, we have a very unusual restaurant called the
Side Track Cafe. It is worth traveling to. They specialize in amazing
omelettes, croissant stuffed with fantastic combinations of meat,
cheese and so on, homemade soups and homemade desserts. It's quite
small. You see, it is a diner, and has about 12 counter seats. It is
one of the diners manufactured by the Worcester Lunch Car Company.
There are quite a few of these still remaining in the Worcester area.
You can spot them because they often say BOOTH SERVICE on the front.
In the Spring and Summer, the Side Track has booth service, too, in a
screened addition built off to the side of the diner. Which brings me
to the point of this excursion. The time has arrived for the Side
Track to start its warm weather season, so the hours and a bunch of
things change. Arriving there and not finding them open or serving
what you thought they might could be irritating, so pay attention:

   SIDE TRACK CAFE---NEW SPRING/SUMMER HOURS &amp; MENU

                 BEGINING APRIL 19TH

Monday through Friday:

Continental Breakfast 7a.m. to 11a.m. (Sorry, no more full breakfast 'til fall)

Lunch               11:30a.m. to 3:00p.m.

Dinner                  5p.m. to  9p.m.

Closed Saturday and Sunday

Besides the changeover from omelettes to home-baked muffins for
breakfast, chili and nachos go off the lunch menu til fall and are
replaced by more veggie-full fare.

They have recently gotten a beer and wine license.

So, food fans, there are just a few weeks left to try out Sunday
brunch accompanied by a Mimosa made with fresh squeezed orange juice,
from a authentic 1920's style orange juice extractor! But then, one
can look forward to sipping white Bordeaux and watching the sun go
down over the Assabet!

A while ago, riding home on the van, someone noticed a double bill at
a theatre we were passing:

        +-------------------------------+
        |       M I S S I N G           |
        |                               |

        |  W I T H O U T  A  T R A C E  |
        +-------------------------------+

This set me to thinking, if you can call any 5 p.m. mental process
"thinking." What about similar concatenated double bills? Such as:

        MY FAVORITE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY

Or a quadruple bill:

        GONE WITH THE WIND AND THE THE LION IN WINTER KILLS

Yeah, well, you had to be there. I mean, golly gee, Batman, anybody
can come up with A FAREWELL TO ARMS AND THE MAN or THE LONG GOODBYE,
COLUMBUS. The trick is to make it creative and keep it clean.
Otherwise, you get a Peter Benchley festival -- sort of:

The time feels right for some fun &amp; games on DESPERADO.  Hey, kids, how
about having some fun with ... movie titles?  Two games come immediately
to mind:

1.  Triple Feature -- In which three movie titles are combined to tell
a little story.  The standard combination goes something like this:

             STRANGERS ON A TRAIN
             BRIEF ENCOUNTER
             BABY MAKES THREE

You get the idea.

2.  Supertitle -- In which two titles are combined:

             MR. LUCKY LADY

Or three:

             MR. LUCKY LADY SINGS THE BLUES

Or four:

             MR. LUCKY LADY SINGS THE BLUES BROTHERS

Or even five:

             MR. LUCKY LADY SINGS THE BLUES BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

to make one long title.

For the last year, I have been working on DECtalk, a high quality
text-to-speech synthesizer.  An article on this work will appear in
next week's Electronics (should be out the week of April 18th) and I
thought Desperados might enjoy a brief summary and an early chance to
hear the demo.

DECtalk uses a 68000 with 256kbytes ROM to convert unrestricted
English text to synthesizer parameters.  These are transmitted to a
TMS32010 digital signal processor to generate the analog waveform.
The 68000 uses a large lexicon and a set of about 400 letter-to-sound
conversion rules.  The lexicon (occupying about 1/2 of the ROM space)
guarantees correct pronounciation for a large subset of English and
cuts down processing time for common words. DECtalk also contains
heuristics to process abbreviations, numbers, and acronyms.

To communicate with the outside world, DECtalk contains two
asychronous terminal lines (one with modem control) and a built-in
telephone line interface with DTMF (Touch-Tone) decoder.

The processing requirements are interesting:  English text, entered at
about 30 bytes per second, is converted by the 68000 to synthesizer
parameter blocks (18 16-bit words).  The TMS DSP reads a new parameter
block every 6.5 msec. and generates 10,000 12-bit samples per second.
All processing is digital -- the only analog component on the board is
the DAC anti-aliasing filter.

DECtalk software was written in C -- the board has a home-brew
Unix-flavored real-time operating system.  This allowed us to debug
text-to-speech modules a timesharing system.  (The non-real-time
components run on VMS, Unix, RSTS, RT11, and TOPS-20.)

If you would rather listen to DECtalk than read about it, feel free to
call (617) 493-7625 (preferably from a Touch-Tone phone).

Your comments and suggestions are most welcome.

Regards.

My comment is, why doesn't it run under DEC's best and most popular,

Talk about renaming systems at the last minute (the MV 10000).  Back
in 1977, when DEC was getting ready to announce the first VAX, they
went through a whole string of names in the space of a week or two.
The development name of the VAX was STAR (and VMS was STARLET).  Some
promotional literature was developed with around the theme of stars.
Then came the decision to name the system the PDP-11/770.  Out went
all the star stuff, and a new bunch of stuff was developed.  Then the
decision was made to change the name to the VAX-11/770. (They wanted a
distinct name for the VAX family.)  So the artists grumblingly went
back to work.  Then someone thought, "Hey, it's FY78, how about making
it the VAX-11/780?"  So that's what it finally became.  (After the
announcement, Business Week said the name "was obviously chosen by a
committee.")

                                        Lee

P.S. After they came up with the final VAX logo, someone in Europe complained
because there were twin zig-zags in the middle of it, reminiscent of the SS.
So they had to change that a few days before announcement, too.
