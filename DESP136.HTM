A recent experience matching old but working computer equipment, no longer
needed by my cost center, to internal and external non-profit organizations
wanting same, made me aware of the large amount of unused equipment within DEC
and the needs of many schools in the area.  In an effort to keep old processors
and peripherals away from the receiving end of a large hammer, if you do know
of any cost centers or non-profit organizations (including schools) which can
make use of used but working DEC equipment, have them contact Nell Lagerquist
at Spit Brook personnel.  They must be specific as to what they are requesting,
not just "anything" or "disks."  Any internal groups needing older disk drives,
such as RM05s, RK05s, RK06s or RM03s can contact Kevin St. George by mail at
ZEKE::ST_GEORGE.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
PLEASE do not send notice of such orphaned equipment to me, I beg you. There's
Nell longing to hear from you, and here's me, horrorstruck at the prospect
of brokering the marriages of your old tape drives and the worthy recipients.

Happy 59th birthday, Chuck Berry, you old seminal rocker, you. My illustrated
History of Rock and Roll Part I calendar puts the event on Friday, October 18,
and why would they lie to me? Interesting that the last Desperado was headed
with my favorite lines from my favorite Chuck Berry song.

And if you like country music, don't miss _Sweet Dreams_, the marvellous
biopic of Patsy Cline, with herself singing the songs while Jessica Lange,
in a fine performance, lipsynchs with great skill, in fact, transparently.
Although, if you like country music, you know about the movie and probably
saw it before I did!

All this will probably put our next correspondent into shock. I never said
my taste was anything but eclectic...

Subj:   _Carmina_Burana_

Therry, you've hit a resounding chord with mention of _Carmina_Burana_.  I
prefer the Deutsche Grammophon recording done under the supervision of Orff
himself, but then I've always had a soft spot for Dietrich Fischer-Diskau's
lovely baritone.  The old Columbia version with Ormandy and the Phil and the
Rutgers University Chorus, is also still a winner.

For those Desperadi, -os, -im, -ae, etc., who may not know CB, a quick note on
its derivation:  Orff wrote the music, but there are also other versions sung
in Mediaeval style.  The songs Orff used are a selection from a large body of
poems written in the Middle Ages by a loose band of itinerant friars called
Goliards, hence the term Goliardic poetry.  And they're a great deal more than
rowdy, as Therry well knows.  They're bawdy and suggestive and downright lewd.
One of the ones Orff used, which he scored for soprano, consists of a single
line of Latin:

        Dulcissime, totam tibi subdo me.

...which I choose to translate as:

        O sweetest one, I yield my all to you.

Sure, CB is schlock.  But it's wonderful schlock !

And as for me, olim lacus colueram.  Maybe I still do...
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Latin scholars, help help help! There's two Latin phrases in this Desperado
that escape me. (I do pretty well when they're from the liturgy, but
ex cathedra as it were, I'm lost. That's a pun, Latin scholars.) Somebody
translate Ann Staffeld's personal name for us, and Mr. Binder's valediction.

Subj:   Oh no she didn't---

Gulp, dear DESP, the true story on Margaret Fuller (who is one of my
favorite people in this world) is far other....

Going strictly from memory, I can assure you that:

She was one of the very early vindicators of the rights of women, long
before such a stance was the slightest bit acceptable;

She alone of all the N. E. Transcendentalists, male or female, managed
to kick over the most repressive aspects of the culture; she whisked off
to Italy and married an Italian count ten years her junior, after first
bearing his child out of wedlock;

This story was suppressed by her shocked family and friends and her
biography bowdlerized, but enough written evidence remained to recon-
struct the truth;

She died in a shipwreck off Fire Island, the last survivor, after first
watching her husband and her infant son sink beneath the stormy waves;

These events were witnessed by individuals who did not try to go to the
rescue because they planned to sack the hulk for booty later;

Thoreau (among others) tromped the beaches looking for remains of the
shipwreck.

Now memory being what it is, I can't vouch for every word, but I'm sure
the outline is correct.  And I think she DESERVES to have a conference
room named after her.  It hardly seems excessive.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I think I confused her death with Mary Shelley's death, which I may be
confusing with Mary Wollstonecraft's death (she was Mary Shelley's mother).
I think.

Subj:   Margaret Fuller's Death

I recall that she died by drowning in a boating accident on her way back
from Italy to the US.  The ship sank off Long Island.  Thoreau was said
to have traveled to the shore nearest the wreck and celebrated.  I doubt
that she was birthing at the time, and I doubt she died in childbirth
before the ship went down.

But Fuller's demise (I tending to adopt Hawthorne's ironic view of things)
began much before the water first entered her lungs.  That she married an
Italian count was the first really major choice that I can still not understand.
There were counts on every doorstep, titles being dispensed for the most
trivial reasons by a wide variety of functionaries.  There were no
prerequisites of breeding, wealth, or merit for aspiring "nobility".
And Fuller's count was said only to be a glorified servant, both illerate
and boorish -- a hanger-on at soirees, handsome but greasy, and I think
I recall Hawthorne casting aspersions at the state of the fellow's teeth
(but for Hawthorne decaying dental work was an emblem of a moral condition,
so you can't be too sure on the accuracy of his aspersions, especially since
Hawthorne got most of his information about Margaret second-hand -- I don't
remember their having met in Italy).

She did have a child in Italy, I think (that perhaps having something to
do with her motives for marriage), and I think the boy died in the same
wreck off Long Island.  I'm reaching pretty far back for this stuff, but I
think it's reasonably close.  Certainly the synaptic failure that allowed a
powerful intellect like Fuller to get mixed up with the sleaziest of company
in Italy is a profound mystery to me (what? was she human? did she need
companionship and physical affection? How strange and inconsistent.) Was he
the first pretty face to pay any non-intellectual attention to her? The first
one too stupid to be intimidated by her intellect?  The possibilities are only
depressing. Hawthorne saw it as an acquiescence to her femininity, which he
thought she had so long denied.  He actually had an excellent friendship with
Fuller and spend many enjoyable hours conversing on a wide variety of subjects.

Time to stop before I fall over the edge into my Hawthorne biography that
remains to be written.

Subj:   Geography of New England

        I read through the list of King Street conference rooms and
wondered what Andrew Wyeth has to do with New England.  As far as I
can recall, generations of Wyeth's have lived in the Brandywine Valley.
At least that is what I recall from a trip to the Brandywine Art Museum,
where they have a large collection of works of the Wyeth family.

        For those not so good with the geography of the Middle Atlantic
States, the Brandywine Valley is a region of southeastern Pennsylvania
and northern Delaware.  The museum I mentioned is in Wilmington, DE.

        While you are in Wilmington visiting the museum, also go
to the Hagley and Winterthur museums.  Hagley is the original
site of the DuPont Corp.  It includes the family mansion, a working
powder mill, and some interesting history of the founding of Delaware.
Winterthur used to be a DuPont family mansion (I forget which one) and
now exibits antique furniture.  The mansion is nice, but the grounds
are nicer.  They have lots of flower gardens to stroll through.  Be
sure to catch this one in the springtime (which starts in March in
Delaware).

        Do you think this message shows I am a native Delawarian?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Just a little around the edges. As far as I know, the only Wyeth who hangs out
in New England is Jamie, who has Rockwell Kent's old house on Monhegan Island.

Subj:   In re: A legend in its Own Mind

It is obscure to me why a course on the history of Harvard and of the
idea of Harvard should seem odd or amusing.  Even those who might
(quite wrongly, I think) belittle the qualitative significance of
Harvard's past cannot begrudge its quantitative preeminence.  Besides,
perhaps Harvard's second most distinguishing trait is that it is a legend
not so much in its Own Mind (unless this refers principally to a prominent
sub-class of alumni), as in most everyone else's.

In any case, readers should know that the primary attraction of this
offering is not its subject, but its instructor.  Peter Gomes is less
distinguished by his formidable Title than by his learning and wit.
Though his first calling is as a Divine (with talents in the preaching
and praying departments on occasions both public and private that are,
in my experience, unsurpassed), he is a more than respectable intellectual
historian as well, particularly regarding colonial New England.  I dare
speculate that this course is an offshoot of a publication he is preparing
for Harvard's Sesquitercentenary (I hope I've got that one right).  'Tis
pity that it's too late to sign up officially, but perhaps one could
discretely slip in to hear a few lectures.

that 50 yards down the street a house had been pretty well smashed by large
falling plants; and over the next few days I noticed other houses in the same
or worse shape (in the Wayland-Framingham-Sudbury-Marlborough area through
which I drive to work).  I feel lucky.  One feature of the news programs is
that, from what I saw, they avoided scenes of tearful families on the curb in
front of their burnt or smashed houses ("Tell me, Mrs. Foo, where are you
going to be living tomorrow?"), which was either due to a lack of coordination
in getting to the scene or maybe due to some sense of responsibility.

Subj:   About trolley car (aka streetcarPRINT) wires

In the latest DESPERADO someone was writing about the fact that Worcester
didn't lose power during the hurricane because most of the wiring is
under ground.  (We didn't lose power in Hancock, NH and, believe me, no one
has even thought of putting the electric lines under ground in those
boondocks.)

Anyway, the person mentioned that the reason there are no more trolleys
in Worcester is that they couldn't put the wires on the ground.  Obviously
this person (being undoubtedly younger than I am) was never in Washington
D. C. in the days of streetcars.  The wires for the streetcars were indeed
under ground.  In between the two tracks there was a third "track" that
consisted of two strips of metal with a slit in between.  The streetcar
cable was attached to the power lines through this slit.  I can't recall
that the streetcars ever lost power because of a disconnection.  This
problem did occur in Baltimore where the wires were all above ground.

By the way, whenever a Washington streetcar crossed into Virginia, the
driver had to go outside the car, remove the cable from the below ground
wiring and hook it onto the above ground wiring.  Virginia wires were
all above ground.  I lived in Maryland in those days.  The streetcar line
stopped at the border and you had to get onto a bus to continue your trip.

Just a small trivia item.

More on the Hurricane Watch: One of the Channel 5 newsreaders noted that

By the way, I agree with Andy Bodge that the electronic media had a serious
role to play in sounding the alarm. Dare I admit that I lived through the
hurricane of '38? Of course, I was too young to remember much about it, except
that it ripped the roof off my Grandfather's barn in Framingham; but I do
remember the one in '60 (was that Carol?), and it was no laughing matter.

Anyone interested in reading about '38 should dig up volume 2 of William

Subj:   More on the Pilot's View

When I was working for another company, I had to fly to Manchester, England
about every other week (to work at the National GIRO Center, in Bootle,
outside of Liverpool - definitely NOT the cultural hot spot of England).

As I recall, the FAA has regulations about the cockpit door being closed
during takeoffs and landings at US airports, but apparently other countries
are different.  Anyway, on British Airways we were in a VC10(?), which carries
about 120 people uncomfortably, and every flight would land at Scottland,
before continuing on to Manchester.  On most every flight, they would leave
the cockpit door open during landings and takeoffs at this airport (only).

If you had an aisle seat, you got a fine view of the runway during this time.
I thought it was great - gives you a real sense of motion to see the ground
rushing towards you.  Anyway, the runway always looked big enough to me.

The only shaky experience I had was landing at JFK on time, during a storm.
There was lots of cross-wind, and one blast hit us just as we were touching
down, and we definitely hit only the right rear wheels first, with the left
jarringly touching a second later.  The pilot got some applause after we were
finally braking to a stop.

Landing through a lightning storm at night is also an interesting experience.

The DECBIGBAND is marking its 10 years in existence with a gala concert/dance,
to be held Friday, November 1, at the Sheraton-Boxboro hotel. Admission to
the performance (which starts at 8:30 and ends at 11:30) is $5.00, payable
at the door; and all proceeds are to be sent to Oxfam-America to be used in
the fight against world hunger.

The DECBIGBAND was formed in 1975 as a musical hobby group for employees of
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Since then it has evolved into one of the
best of the local amateur big bands in the New England area. Still comprising
only DEC employees, the band plays music from the golden age of Swing up to
and including music of the Beatles, with many other stylistic stops in be-
tween, but above all it embodies the energetic style of its leader, John
Kaufmann.

This is the third such charitable event the band has sponsored, the previous
two having taken place last Spring, raising $1200 for Oxfam-America. The band
hope to do at least twice as well this time.

To reach the Sheraton-Boxboro (who are donating the use of their grand ball-
room, by the way), you'd take route 495 north from the Mass Pike, or south
from Routes 2 or 3, and then get off at route 111, eastbound. From route 128,
take route 2 to route 111, westbound. There will be a cash bar, and no re-

My favorite quote from St. Augustine, by the way, is "The reward of patience
is more patience."

DSSDEV::EPPES sent me and the other chums on HUMOR a compendium from many
sources, but I've lumped them all together, rearranged, deleted a
few, sold a few to the gypsies, you know how it goes...

A few months ago, William Safire did a brilliant piece for the New York
Times magazine on oxymorons. Anybody remember it?

Everybody loves this time of year, right? Not me. On my way to work I drive
by a big field where the farmer grows corn sometimes but this year he's
growing this disgusting squash. Big, warty, pale green, and now that it's
been harvested, it's all lumped together in big piles. Far from the frost
being on the pumpkin, all the squash vines have been pulled up and piled on top
of these heaps to protect them from the frost, and frankly, it's scary!
All these hairy brown squash vines with big warty pale green squash
poking through here and there...shudder. Talk about Night of the Living
Hubbard Squash...
