Subj:   Santa vs Satan

       WASHINGTON -- Maybe there is something to be grateful for this
season, after all. In his annual Christmas card John M. Snyder, an
active member of the capital's gun lobby, has eschewed his previous
habit of showing Santa Claus armed with a pistol or brandishing a
machine gun.
       This time, instead of Santa, the illustration shows the
Archangel Michael standing astride a prostrate Satan. True, the
angel is armed, with a sword at his side and a submachine gun slung
over his shoulder, but he is also cradling an infant and thus is
clearly incapable of instant combat.

                        THREE QUICK BOOK REVIEWS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Iron &amp; Silk by Mark Salzman, Vintage Departures

This is just about a perfect book.  Every expectation raised in the course
of the book is satisfied by the end of the book.  It's like going to a
restaurant where everything is wonderful and then at the end of the meal
you order coffee and the coffee too is wonderful.

It's about China.  He's teaching English and studying martial arts in
China.  His students write short essays.  He gets to work with Master Pan,
the greatest martial artist in China, who has never had a student before.
He meets some fishermen and takes a meal with them.  He tunes a piano.  He
takes a girl for a ride on a bicycle on a cold night.  Everything that
happens to him comes out as a short story. It's wonderful.

The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe

Now out in paperback and well worth the price.  There are very few Tom
Wolfe tangerine flake touches.  Mostly it's a real interesting story about
a bond trader who gets lost in darkest nonManhattan and bravely fights off
robbers only to end up accused of running down an honor student and all
that happens after that.  Despite what you've heard, it's not really as
good as Dickens, but it is good as the dickens and you really want to know
how it comes out.  And it's funny.

My Father's House by Sylvia Fraser, Ticknor &amp; Fields

Not even a little bit funny.  Not one bit.  But what a book!  Sylvia Fraser
is a Canadian novelist who worried that her books seemed strangely tinged
with horrific images and sexual oppression.  In her innocence, she tried to
find out where it all came from.  The book is her story of her discovery
that she had been sexually abused by her father from infancy to young
womanhood and had repressed all memory of it.  As a blurb brilliantly puts
it, "It is an exciting mystery story in which the detective is part of the
narrator and so is the murder victim."  There are no ghastly details and no
terrible retribution, but rather an extremely well-told tale of how a brave
woman rescued her equally brave infant and child selves from darkness.
Don't let the subject matter scare you off, this is one damn fine book by
any standard.

Just saw the word "explosition" floating by on the net.  I suppose that's
an explosion that advances one's thesis.  They're not just explosions,
they're arguments for our cause.  Which reminds me of the man from the gas
company stating that ovens do not explode.  "We call that a puffback."  Of
course, it coulda just been a typ-o.

Subj:   Mix-up Impedes Romance

One day, after I logged in to my CMS account here, I discovered that new mail
was waiting for me in my reader.  The lengthy message was prefaced by the
heading:

     "From: Mailer@&lt;machine&gt;: Your message could not be sent ..etc"
     "Reason:  Address unknown..."

Upon scanning this returned letter, I discovered that it had not been
written by me at all, and that the intended recipient and sender were
thousands of miles away, apparently the unfortunate victims of a random
mailer screw-up.  The first sentence of that letter, though, I will
always remember:

     "My dearest Janice:
      At last, we have a method of non-verbal communication which is
      completely private..."

Subj:   Dan is an apostle of Bob

A Kalamazoo housewife told the Nation Enquirer last week that she had
spotted Dan Quayle in a suburban supermarket.

Midge Bickelman said the long missing vice president-elect approached
her in the condiment section of her neighborhood Stoppe 'n Shoppe and
asked if she had seen a gold ball rolling past.

"At first, I thought he was Robert Redford," she said.  "He was real nice.
I told him I was double parked outside and could he hep me get through the
Express Line, even though I had 13 items.  He looked right into my eyes,
and I'll never forget what he said to me.  He said, 'I don't know, I'll ask
my father.'"

Mrs. Bickelman's story followed numerous other sightings of the vanished
leader.  In Pasquoddie, Maine, Caleb Barnstable claimed he saw Qualye in
the rug department of Atterbury's Department Store.  "He was practicing
chip shots on a 16th Century Peshawar Karastan," said Barnstable.  "Fine
fela.  Replaced all his divots."

Asked if he was sure the man was Quayle, Barnstable said, "Yep.  Recognized
him from his picture on a milk carton."

The mystery of the former Indiana senator's disappearance has given rise
to a cult like following.  In Citrus Glade, Florida, for example, hundreds
of true believers gather at The Municipal Fly Casting Pool each evening.
If a gentle breeze springs up from the northwest, they say, Quayle's profile
can clearly be seen in the ripples.

This has given rise to reports that the water has gained mystic healing
powers.  "I just stuck my left arm in up to the elbow," claimed Jason
Fargunheit, 67, "and it cured my wicked slice."

Legends are already cropping up.  In Indianapolis, old soldiers in the
National Guard's 120th Public Information Detachment say that on wintry
nights they often see Quayle patrolling the battlements of the Armory in
uniform, the irons clanking in the golf bag over his shoulder.

His more religious former comrades anxiously cross themselves.  The more
worldly, however, simply shout, "Hey, Dan, let's go nail some Commies," and
the apparition swiftly fades away.

Perhaps the most exotic sighting was last Tuesday at the Metalwood Golf Club
in Des Moines.  Club Pro Dennis Fingrite told reporters: "This handsome guy
had just hit this great drive off the first tee.  I heard this humming noise,
and this big saucer bounces off a tree and bumps to a landing right in front
of him.  Then this slack-jawed, bug-eyed creature with two heads gets out and
says, 'We want you for our leader, Dan; you're our kind of guy'"

Fingrite said Quayle hesitated at first, but when the alien told him there
were no media on his planet, he happily danced aboard the spaceship, waggling
his hips and singing, "I just wanna be your teddy bear."

"I was pretty sore he'd defect so easily," said Fingrite, "So I shouted after
him, 'Believe me, Senator, you're no Elvis Presley.'"

Needless to say, Quayle or his extoplasm has been reportedly seen at numerous
funerals, such as that for Binkie the gerbil at The Home of Eternal Rest Pet
Mausoleum in Muncie.  Quayle, who told mourners he was "just practicing,"
delivered a moving eulogy in which he said Binkie had gone to "The Great 19th
Hole in the Sky."

But the most frightiening sighting of all was in the White House itself.
Guard Hoskins Phelp was found unconscious on the floor of the East Wing at
12:23 a.m.  On being revived, the pale, sweating officer gasped that he had
seen the vice president-elect seated behind the desk in the Oval Office.

Authorities did their best to quell rapidly spreading panic.  A hastily
convened Board of Parapsychologists investigated and concluded the apparition
was due to natural phenomena.

"That wasn't Dan Quayle," they assured a much relieved nation.  "That was
swamp gas."

Subj:   The Subtle Journal of Raw Coinage

The Subtle Journal of Raw Coinage is a small mail-art magazine (to use
the term loosely) that specializes in new words, discovered or created.
An issue usually consists of less than ten words artfully arranged on
unexpected pieces of paper (ie, issue No. 6 (Labrys) is folded into a
matchbook cover and seems to have something to do with radical feminism,
issue No 5 (Abbriefs) specializes in abbreviations and is handwritten on
a strip of theater tickets).

I sent the editor some excerpts from INFO-DP, which were well-received
and may be included in future issues.  He wants to know who to credit,
the program or its author.  Who was the originator of DP?

Issue prices range from 10 cents to $2.  I have a catalog, but you might
as well take potluck:

TV HYPNOTIST ENTRANCES BOY

Palermo, Sicily:  An 8-year-old boy spent more than three hours with his
hands locked together when he fell into a trance after watching a
hypnotist on television, his family said yesterday.

Doctors had to trace the hypnotist, Giucas Casella, on Saturday night
and get him to break the spell over Giusto Durante by reciting "One, two,
three, your hands are free" over the telephone.

Casella was found in a hospital in Rome, where he was recovering from
his act.  He had stuck a skewer in his neck in a failed display of mind
over matter and had to carry on the show with blood streaming down his
collar.

Subj:   I always wondered what a printer was - now I know!

Just got a VAXstation with an owner's manual containing a glossary of
definitions of all those terms I always wondered about. They even go to the
trouble of italicizing the first occurrence of these new words, so that you'll
know they're in the glossary. What a convenience! Your *data* is *stored* on
your *system* *disk*. I'm glad to see that we provide this vital information to
customers. If I had just spent $20K on a workstation, I'd want to know what
these words meant too:

"Communications - a cable along which electrical systems are transmitted.
Devices or systems that are connected by a communications line can share
information and resources."

"Data - a formal representation of information suitable for communication,
interpretation and processing by humans or computers."

"Hardware - the physical components - mechanical and electrical - that make up a
system. Compare to Software."

"Printer - a peripheral device that provides paper copies of information stored
on the system."

"Program - the sequence of instructions the system uses to perform a task."

"Software - programs executed by the system to perform a chosen or required
function. Compare to Hardware."

My only complaint is that they didn't go far enough. They didn't italicize the
first occurrence of the words 'chapter', 'operate' or 'the'. My suggestion is
that for consistency's sake they put the entire manual in italics, replace the
glossary with the pocket American Heritage dictionary, and add the Digital
Dictionary as an Appendix.

Have holidays and good ones and remember that the stale fruit cake and the
ugly tie means that someone cares about you.  Have a nice dream,
