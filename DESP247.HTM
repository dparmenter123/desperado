        How could I have written such a stupid thing about the Doors?

        "No band that does no more than lift the best from Baudelaire and
        the worst from Las Vegas should ever be allowed in."

        How could I have written such a stupid thing about Baudelaire?

        Belly Roll Morrison didn't lift the best from Baudelaire.  He
        copped some attitudes from his pals in the poetry club who
        all thought Baudelaire was one moody, storm-ridin' kind of a
        decadent guy.

        There's nothing in any Doors song one-hundredth as good as:

                The poet is like the prince in the clouds
                Who haunts the tempest and laughs at the archer;
                Exiled on the ground in the midst of jeers,
                His giant wings prevent him from walking.

        Or:

                Perfumes, colors and sounds echo one another.

        They do?  They do.

        Or:

                What do I care that you are good?
                Be beautiful! and be sad!

        Or:

                Here is the charming evening, the criminal's friend:
                It comes like an accomplice, with stealthy tread.

        There's one quote in Bartlett's (I'm working from the ZK library
        on this one) that might be *about* the Doors:

                What is that sad, dark island?--It is Cythera,
                They tell us, a country famous in song,
                Banal Eldorado of all the old bachelors.
                Look! after all, it is a poor land!

        Then, to my amazement (Did Rimbaud know about these remarks?) some
        stuff that might have come from Emerson (of all people!):

                There can be no progress (real, that is, moral) except in
                the individual and by the individual himself.

                To be a great man and a saint for oneself, that is the one
                important thing.

                Theory of the true civilization:  It is not to be found in
                gas or steam or table turning.  It consists in the
                diminution of the traces of original sin.

        Oh, yes, but:

                You must shock the bourgeois.  (Il faut épater le
                bourgeois.)

        I did hear the Doors doing "LA Woman" the other night.  It's not
        half bad.

        About 15 per cent bad.  The rest I actually enjoyed.

        I missed a few of the new members of the Hall.

        Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers

        Jack E. Leonard did a joke:  "Why do fools fall in love?  Because
        they're idiots!"

        Frankie Lymon had a voice from heaven and a life from hell.  When
        he was on the road he had to travel with an older woman who was
        introduced as his chaperone, who, in fact, was the woman he was
        pronging at the time.  He was robbed of his money by his
        management and he was robbed of his life by heroin.  All that was
        left was his immortality.

        It's hard to say why this particular doo-wop group should be
        honored over, say, The Five Keys, but they did have the biggest
        hit.

        Dinah Washington

        I was wrong.  Dinah Washington made it.  Justice is done.  Her
        career might be considered a paradigm of selling out in that she
        started out singing blues in smoky joints and ended up in singing
        ballads in supper clubs, but if you heard her sing you'd never say
        such a thing.  She was billed as the Queen of the Blues and lived
        up to it, a voice drenched in blues with the power to belt it out
        and with sexiness and brains behind even the most banal tune.  I
        wish Madonna could have met her.  There's too much to mention, but
        while she made a lot of bad records of bad songs, you couldn't go
        wrong listening on the basis of her name alone.  One album sticks
        out in my mind, "Dinah Washington Sings Bessie Smith".  No joke,
        chills ran down my spine just from typing the words.  In
        particular, "Back Water Blues", the song Bessie (herself the
        Empress of the Blues) sang about a great Mississippi flood.  I
        should also mention Cole Porter's "Love for Sale" on the one hand,
        and "Long John is my dentist and I got a cavity that's needin'
        fillin'" on the other hand.  An artist all the way.

        Dick Clark

        Totally deserved recognition, but, until Casey Kasem makes it, the
        unfunkiest human in the entire Hall of Fame.

        More disc jockeys!

        Milt Gabler

        He was entered as a record producer, but I've drawn a blank.  Best
        I can come up with is that he was one of the founders of the
        independent record industry as the owner of Commodore, but
        Commodore was pretty much a jazz label of the 40s.  I'll try to put
        some more together about him, but there should be more record
        producers too.

About your complaints about who got in and why, I guess you just have to
realize that it's a Hall of FAME, not a Hall of MERIT.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Yeah.  There really is a place for the Doors, just not on *my*
        turntable.

        I was thinking about replacing the Hall of Fame with a sort of
        family tree of "music that made a difference", or "music you can
        still stand after 5, 10, 20, 30, more years of listening to it".

        I'd say a Hall of Merit makes more sense than a Hall of Fame.  If
        you're famous,  you don't need a hall, but if you're meritorious,
        you might need that extra protection.

Subj:   [talk.bizarre] The Curse of Jim Morrison]

From: rvacca@vyasa.helios.nd.edu (robert vacca)
Newsgroups: talk.bizarre
Subject: The Curse of Jim Morrison
Summary: True story.  Really.  I Swear To God (tm).
Organization: University of Notre Dame
X-Claimer: This is a work of non-fiction!
           It really happened to my girlfriend and her mother!
           Wow!  Gosh!  Gee!

        Late December snow turned to slush in Paris.  The
streets were slushy, the sidewalks were slushy, and the chic
Parisienne sidewalk cafes and coffee-houses were slushy.
        The tomb of Jim Morrison was not slushy, because the
Cult of Morrison had cleaned it off.
        They were there that day, the day after Christmas, the
same as any other day.  There were only ten of them, uncertain
of who they were or what they wanted in life, save that Jim
Morrison fit into it somewhere.  Some were Americans, some were
Swedes, some Brits, some Aussies, most of them French.  They
weren't sure who was of what nationality, themselves included.
It didn't matter.  They rarely spoke anyway, even to each other.
They just sat at His tomb, waiting for something.  In the summer,
they were an army. In the dead of winter, they were nothing more
than a rag-tag handful, as if the melting snow turned into members
of the cult.
        Farther back in the cemetery, two women were walking
towards the tomb.  The casual observer would have thought they
were related, as they were- mother and daughter.  Both were
exceptionally tall- the mother almost six feet, the daughter
perhaps three inches shorter.  They were talking, English with
an American accent.  The mother had a camera, the daughter did
not.  The daughter was speaking.
        "Mother, I appreciate your coming with me, but did you
have to bring that camera?  We'll look like tourists."
        "Dear, we _are_ tourists.  Or do you fancy yourself a
pilgrim?" asked her mother.
        The daughter thought about that seriously.  "No," she
finally spoke, "more of a surrogate pilgrim.  I'd like to see
this for myself, but mostly so I can describe this to Dave when
we get back to the U.S."
        The mother laughed briefly, and asked "Then why don't
you have a camera?"
        "I don't have a camera because that isn't how you're
supposed to do this.  Even I know that."
        "But I thought you weren't a big Doors fan."
        "I'm not, but Dave is.  Besides, the batteries for my
camera are dead."
        They both had a bit of a laugh at that, as they reached
the tomb.  The daughter climbed onto a neighboring tombstone,
and watched Morrison's grave intently, as if expecting it to
move.  Since this was acceptable behavior, the Cult of Morrison
left her alone.
        The mother stood to one side, and watched.  The grave
did not hold the same interest for her as it seemed to for her
daughter or the other scruffy types encamped around the grave.
        The other people did.
        She was an inveterate people-watcher, and found the Cult
of Morrison (as she did not know they were called) fascinating,
combining the mannerisms of monks and junkies, which she guessed-
accurately- they were.  At first she was content to watch, but the
impulse to record on film the people (she found the tomb rather
dull) became overpowering.  She readied her camera, then held it
at her side, and took a number of surreptitious photos, without
aiming.
        She'd gotten off almost the entire roll before one of the
Cult of Morrison saw her.  He drew himself to his feet, looked for
his voice, found it, and spoke a few words in French.
        The mother looked at him blankly.
        The man- more a boy, really, younger than her daughter-
then spoke a few words in English.
        "They will all be blank."
        "Wh-what?"
        "They will all be blank."
        The mother stared.
        "They will all be blank."
        Slowly, the gazes of the collected Cult of Morrison turned
towards the mother, silently.  She noticed her daughter among them.
She met their collected gaze for a brief moment, then quailed, and
turned to go.
        "Let's go now, shall we?" she called over her shoulder to
her daughter.  Her daughter shook her head, as if coming out of
a trance, then got off the tombstone she'd been sitting on.  She
flashed a sheepish grin at the Cult of Morrison, and ran after her
mother.
        A week later, the mother was arguing with a Customer
Service Representative for the pharmacy.
        "I tell you, ma'am," asserted the nervous young man, "we
did not ruin those pictures.  If we had exposed them to light,
they'd have been black.  They're clear, and it's not possible to
develop exposed film, no matter what mistakes you make, and get
clear negatives.  I'm afraid you must have brought us a roll of
blank film."

    I just bought a sheet of Dorothy Parker stamps.  Now I can play house

    Baby I don't care" and Dotty slice her wrists.  (Well, _pretend_ slice
    her wrists; the postal service, not wanting to hold a nationwide vote
    for "pre-wrist-scar-tissue" vs. "wrist-scar-tissue", only shows her
    from the neck up.)  I can have Dotty say "Elvis's voice covers the
    complete range from A to B" and Elvis get into Dotty's medicine
    cabinet, hilarity ensues. I can have Dotty visit her mother-in-law and
    make caustic remarks about corn products and Elvis lose his temper and
    punch Robert Benchley in the snoot.

Gee, I wonder how long these people intend to try to keep secret the
sex of A----- and from who.  Grandparents?  Babysitters?  Will they
ever utter the name in public?  Will they refrain from saying "he" or
"she" when referring to the baby when outsiders are present?

The studies in question aren't very esoteric, though.  The usual study
is to show an adult a photo or movie of a diapered infant, "happen" to
refer to it as "he" or "she", "Bob" or "Carol", whatever, and then ask
for impressions of what the baby is like.  Each successive subject is
seeing the same baby, but the ones who hear it called "he" and "Bob"
tend to say that it's big, strong, assertive, etc.  You get the idea.

You've undoubtedly heard of TQM, or "Total Quality Management," the
currently fashionable management technique with a cult-like following.
Our current headlong plunge into TQM here at MIT makes the following
excerpt from the front page of a flyer advertising a TQM conference
seem especially (inadvertently?) accurate.

        "The challenge for colleges and universities is to relate the
        TQM philosophies to the special needs of an academic environment.
        Only a handful of academic leaders have devised a TQM policy,
        let alone a TQM implementation strategy!  Even fewer understand
        what TQM is and how it works."

* In December, as France was on the verge of formally
repealing its 88-year-old system of local funeral-
service monopolies, Michel Leclerc was speeding up the
process by opening his latest funeral-service
"supermarket," in Creteil.  "Here, people can take a
cart and do their shopping," Leclerc told the
Associated Press.  Consumers wander down lengthy aisles
and satisfy their funeral needs at "sale" prices.
Leclerc offers many models of caskets, headstones,
plastic flowers, and other accessories, and consumers
make their selections to upbeat background music from
local radio stations. [Charlotte Observer-AP, 11-26-92]

Hooper said he turned down an out-of-court settlement
of a $4-off coupon. [Joplin Globe-AP, 10-25-92]

that bars school discrimination on the basis of gender.
On her first scrimmage, Tawana, a running back, was
tackled and suffered massive internal injuries.  In
October 1992, she filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against
the county board of education for its alleged failure
to inform her of how dangerous football is. [Washington

* Escondido, Calif., attorney Ben Echeverria filed a $2
million lawsuit in August against Texaco, Inc., and a
local gas station manager because station attendants
were pumping gas for women at self-service prices, but

its practice and forced women to start pumping for
themselves. [AP wirecopy, 8-12-92]

* Third-grade teacher Lynne Strumlok was forced to
apologize to students and administrators at the

September for her discliplinary warning of choice:  She
allegedly would pull out a large pair of scissors,
begin menacingly opening and closing them, and warn
students that "Mister Scissors" would cut out their
tongues.  A colleague, Joanne Herschkorn, allegedly
told her class Mister Scissors would take tongues
first, then their livers. [Syracuse Herald American, 9-

by Ketchum, who is blind. [Billings Gazette, Sept92]

Least Competent Person

* Christopher A. Shutt, 17, was arrested for attempted
robbery in Cortland, N. Y., in October after putting a
gun to the head of a clerk in a meat market.  The clerk
told police that she then saw something "fly past my
face."  It was the barrel of Shutt's gun, which fell
off.  Another employee noticed that the barrel had
fallen off and approached Shutt, whereupon Shutt re-
aimed what was left of the gun at him and told him to
get against the wall, until it dawned on him that his
gun was broken.  At that point, the employee disarmed
Shutt and called the police. [Cortland Standard, 10-23-

Flitter stars usually employ a combination of paint grade aluminium (approx.
30 %), black powder (30 %) and potassium perchlorate (30...35 %), the rest
being fine flake or pyro grade aluminium and binder (dextrin, wallpaper
paste). It is quite common to use a combination of two or three different
types of paint grade aluminiums, as one is always seeking for a compromise
between the fierce but short-tailed fine flake aluminium star and the slow
but impressive star with coarse aluminium bronze.

The best aluminiums also make the worst mess. Tiny, glittering flakes of
good aluminium bronze find their way on your skin, clothes, glasses, into
your kitchen, your books; everywhere.

Roger Gascoigne observes:

    It is quaint to see things marked 'Italian sausage' when as such it
    would not be recognized in Italy and there must be 100's of sausages in
    Italy/Poland etc etc. Likewise English Muffins - as a Brit I do not
    know them at all (forget the advert about Thomas leaving England
    although it is fun). Do other Brits here know them ?

These are in fact English in origin (witness the old folk song "Have you seen
the Muffin Man?"), but apparently they disappeared from England during one of
the World Wars (not sure if it's I or II), due to a shortage of one of the key
ingredients, and they never came back.

&gt;    Why do people say hmm-hmm when you thank them - is it not Politically
&gt;    Correct  to say "you're welcome/it was nothing" ?

I think it's a social form.  I don't relate it to the PC/PI system, but then
I'm socially challanged.

A few years ago the US aircraft carrier JFK docked in Boston and had public
tours of the flight deck and hanger deck.  My wife Michelle and I spent an
afternoon going from one place to the next, listening to demonstrations,
asking questions, and then thanking the sailors involved (who were not only
doing a good job, but had probably given up a day of shore leave for this).

All but one of the sailors responded with some variation on "thank *you*".
However, most of the way through the tour, one proud Petty Officer responded
to our thanks with "you're welcome".  I felt this subtly emphasized the value
of the transaction to me.  Since agreed it was valuable, it increased my
appreciation of crewmembers acting as tourguides for us.

This seems quite a contrast with the connotation of "it was nothing" ("de
nada").

&gt;    Creating a new law that is 'tuned' to deal with one manifestation of a
&gt;    problem will only cause the problem to change its appearance to avoid
&gt;    the law. For example - (and please forgive my paraphrasing here) it has
&gt;    become illegal in Chicago for more than two people who are wearing the
&gt;    same coloured clothing to meet together in public. This is supposed to
&gt;    deal with the gang problem ?

        That sounds like a great law!  I hope they enforce it against
        police officers in uniform and professional sports teams!  Alas,
        the non paraphrased version of the law probably has exceptions
        that apply to those gangs, but does it have an exception for
        gangs wearing gray pin stripe suits?

hi Tom,

the below is from your recent desperado, and is incorrect,
for whatever that is worth.

the highest murder rate in the nation is in East Palo Alto
California.  their rate is around twice that of Washington DC.
(murders per capita per year).

/eli

    Likewise the gun ownership laws - and I know this is a subject of great
    emotion here - but the highest rate of murder takes place in Washington
    DC which has the tightest gun laws. It seems that murderers and drug
    dealers do not take the gun ownership laws seriously - but then why
    would they ..... and why would anyone expect them to ?

Subj:   random replies to the random thoughts of Roger Gascoigne

Roger Gascoigne's comments on the US are superb, and perhaps shouldn't
be saddled with a reply, except to note that his observations on the
press and political system are very astute, and perhaps to reassure
him that he is far from alone in his opinions on that subject, even
though it might sometimes seem otherwise.  Nonetheless, I find it
irresistable to add my two cents, and leave it to yr bdy (and mine)
Tom to decide whether to pass these remarks along.

    In Europe I always thought that the US was at the forefront of equal
    rights for women and for the richness of the melting pot of races - not
    my observation of day to day behaviour here though - women are
    disregarded and racist remarks made that shock me. I am also surprised
    at how many women do not take offence at some of the remarks.

True enough, sadly, but there are differences of group and region in
this, especially with regard to the women who don't take offense
(sorry, Roger, that's how we spell it here).  Up here in
more-politically-correct Cambridge, Mass, I have seen local papers
refer to "teenage women", lest they give offense by using the
appellation "girls".  Mind, I don't deny the possibility of a teenage
woman in cases of precocious maturity, but this was a generic
reference.

    Why is it that with such a richness of a multi-cultural heritage here
    people are unable to hear and reproduce a different sounding name ?
    Even when I explain how to say my name " gas - coin like the fuel in
    your car and the money you buy it with" I get some weird responses -
    usually gas-cone; how come so few people have no 'ear'.

This is definitely regional.  In the Midwest, one encounters
relatively few Anglophones who are not also the children of
Anglophones; on top of that, Midwestern English has a very limited
palate of sounds.  (The shibboleth is "Mary was merry when she
married"; the arch-Midwestern sounds like "Mary was mary when she
maried", with all the "a" vowels alike.)  You would doubtless do
better in New York, or even here in provincial Boston where there are
enough French Canadians around, and enough French Canadian hockey
players' names for the locals to memorize, that Gascoigne won't be a
problem.  Besides, I don't think any Frenchman would be terribly
impressed with the multi-culturalism of your British "gas - coin"
pronunciation of your name (my bet is that the original pronunciation
was more nearly like "gas-KWAN-yuh").

    Why do restaurants serve double size meals ? I am now aware that I have
    to cancel the 'silent fries' that will come with sandwiches but are not
    mentioned in the menu - but I still get caught by the 'silent soup'
    that is a default here in Chicago.
    (I am carrying a penalty for this that is proving hard to lose :-[

This could be regional.  Here in Boston, the home of the Bean and the
Cod, I find the portions reasonable; when I lived in Miami (some 15
years ago), there were a number of restaurants which served
OK-but-ordinary food but which tried to impress their customers with
the, ahem, generosity of their portions.  The Chicago default-soup
tradition sounds like it's in the same category.  American restaurants
have improved remarkably in the last 20 years, but I'm not surprised
to hear that one can still find places in the old, less-sophisticated
style.

    Also who said more words were better ? The verbiage really gets to me
    at times. e.g. "at this time" when 'now' would do.  The redundant
    addition of 'ment' as in 'underlayment' The marketing folks really have
    got hold of the language and distorted it - creating verbs out of nouns
    and adding syllables to words that are redundant e.g. 'burglarized'
    when burgled would do.

Blame it on the collapse of the educational system, and the resultant
lack of reading among the hoi polloi.  (No, really, I like these
people; they just don't read enough any more!)  Folks who normally
would say things more simply try to use formal Engish without having
read enough to do so successfully; typically, they over-generalize, so
a somewhat peculiar noun-ending like that of "underlay" gets an
unnecessary but more common "-ment" added on.  By the way, "to
burglarize" from "burglar", like (so help me) "to orientate" from
"orientation" and doubtless other even more egregious examples are, if
I'm not mistaken, what the linguists call "back formations" -- it's
common enough to be a named phenomenon in the (d)evolution of
language.  On the positive side, the oral nature of American English
tends to mean that bad habits come and go, not being enforced on the
young by a literary tradition; Babbitt's mangled English is different
from what you hear now.

Enjoy your stay, Roger; maybe you'll get a chance to pick up enough
baseball to learn what an RBI is, and why it's too damn complicated
for folks to explain out of context...

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        So, you're invoking the infield fly rule rather than explain RBI.
        That may cut into your slugging percentage, not to mention the
        effect on poor Gascoigne's ERA.

        The muffin man, by the way, lives in Drury Lane.  I've heard these
        things called scones, Roger.

        Nobody needs to worry about the devolving of the language.  This
        never happens.  I am writing a book about this.  Stand by.

        Way back in 1984, I cracked wise about "hopefully" in Desperado.
        Just the other day, I came across this, from Usenet circa 1986:

        "Tom Parmenter, a smartass supporter of `hopefully' (who has so
        little feel for language that he describes grammar books as `dry'),
        believes that by exhibiting counterexamples, he or she has refuted
        all opposition to `hopefully' as a sentence modifier."

        Here's what I originally wrote in 1984:

        "Apparently some Desperados think an adverb cannot modify a whole
        sentence. Happily our good English adverbs are tougher than some
        Desperados think they are. Probably most people in their everyday
        speech and writing use adverbs in this way, including some of the
        most improbable.  Obviously sentences are not damaged be being
        modified all at once by one lone adverb.  Evidently the case
        against "hopefully" is that it is a a *new* adverb on the list of
        those adverbs that can modify whole sentences and not just one
        measly verb, and great big grownup sentences, quite complex, though
        still diagrammable, sentences, not that being diagrammable is all
        that big a deal sentencewise.  Mercifully the newness of
        "hopefully" will not will not last forever and the word can settle
        down to its apppointed task of modifying whole sentences.
        Presumably there will by then be some new controversy alarming the
        planet.

        "Among the synonyms and superior substitutes for "hopefully" that
        have been offered by the pundits are the pompous and wordy "it is
        to be  hoped" and the laughable "hopably" and the forlorn
        "hopingly".

        "Clearly I number myself among those who see nothing wrong with
        using  "hopefully" as the genius of the language dictates, and not
        as some  dry grammmar book decrees.  Hopefully this completes the
        discusion."

                                    =*=

        Actually, this whole controversy is dead and most folks who cared
        about "hopefully" have died and gone to heaven, hopefully.

I was privileged to see the original proposal from which these
excerpts were taken; it is extremely funny.

Never think you've seen it all ...
... until you've seen the "Business Plan and Funding Request" of
one Timothy O'Brien, who is planning to produce a play about
object-oriented programming in time for Object World in June, 1993.

From the proposal's "Play Concept and Synopsis":

The play is set in the present in a fictional setting represented by
a world defined through structural design methodology.  Two older
citizens named ... If and Loop ... are out on a task to help find
some lost information ...

Despite their rigid manner, the two characters try to avoid questioning
the meaning and purpose of their roles. ... They are bitter and
frustrated and fear that they will soon become obsolete. ...

... a scrim ... begins to reveal characters ... in dance-like
poses.  These are the Objects, the Messenger, and the Interpreter.
... If and Loop watch in awe as the objects perform their seemingly
effortless dance ... they appeal to the Objects to stop and help
them understand how they are accomplishing this feat so simply.

[...]

In the end, the old is brought forward to the new as If and Loop
are encapsulated into the new world, freeing them from "old"
restraints and unlocking for them a whole new potential.  If and
Loop's step forward represents the ideas of age and experience
combined with youth, the positive forces of innovation, and the
humanizing side of new technology.

        Oooh, "smartass with little feel for the language".  A mean one.
        I just gotta feel for the language more.  Speaking of feel for the
        language, don't think you've missed much by missing Prince
        Charles's extremely un-bonnie conversation with the Rottweiler,
        strictly for 13-year-olds.  I clipped it off the net the other day,
        but it really doesn't make it as bawdy repartee.  There were,
        however, something like 15 dyads of "Goodbye"/"Well, goodbye" which
        dilemma I'm sure all of us can remember from the seventh grade.
