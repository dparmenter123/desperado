There is no better time than February to quit smoking.  I was able to
quit one phlegmy raspy February without exercising any will power
whatsoever, just because conditions were so unfavorable to smoking.
The Surgeon-General often issues his reports in February.  That's how
he got to be a general.

Horace Greeley, he of "Go west, young man" fame, once described a cigar as
"A stick with a fire at one end and a fool at the other."

In like vein, I recall a Monty Python bit in which a scene of a cigarette
being lighted was accompanied by "And now for something completely different -
a man putting burning leaves in his mouth"...

Driving home lately, my carpool colleague and I have noticed that the
Hancock Building (the old one that used to be the tallest building in
Boston) again has colored beacons --- blue or red; flashing or steady.
I remember from my childhood that these lights used to be a signal
about the weather.

Does anyone know if that's what they are now and what the code is? (As
with much in Boston, there seems to be no regular pattern, no
congruence, no consistency, no ...)

Computer-generated poetry is my one toy.  For several years, I have
maintained a BASIC program, copied from the Conway/Archer book
PROGRAMMING FOR POETS, the last 20 lines of which are phrases the
user plugs in.  One also supplies parameters for line length, stanza
length, degree of repetition of phrases, and a few other variables.
The results of course do depend heavily on the vivacity and potential
relatedness of the user input, but the results are occasionally weird
and wonderful and the juxtapositions great fun.

A recent example--and if you enjoy free verse, maybe it's not too
awful--stems from a group of phrases I plugged in all relating
to the analytical symbolism of C. G. Jung:

          "In the Ambience of the Spirit's Thrusting Night"
                   (a computer-generated poem)

        Sweet clarity; sweet sad delusion;
        Jung at heart in the heart's hard darkness

        soaring

                The knifeblade strikes!

        Someone still dances in that glimmering light--
                Sweet clarity; sweet sad delusion.

Dear Mr.  Parmenter, you snob,

I was leafing through some back issues of  Desperado.   Leading  off  issue
#1004  was  a  litany  of  the superiority of the Bit Fiddler, to wit, REAL
PROGRAMMERS.  I have always suspected in my  heart  of  hearts  that  "Real
programmers  don't  write  applications",  but  there  are  some  benighted
individuals who don't know any better.  I became one of these when I  found
that  FORTRAN  and  BASIC  did not afford me sufficient scope for my typing
talents.  I've been thinking about the rest of my colleagues.  We don't get
out much, I grant you, but we do get around.

Real applications programmers know COBOL.  Only COBOL.

Real applications programmers can type 50 words a minute.  They have to.

Real applications programmers write memos with RUNOFF and EDT.

Real applications programmers take courses from Ed.  Services  in  Bedford,
but  they  don't  do  the labs.  If they *do* the labs, they take all their
programs home on a 600 ft.  magtape.

Real applications programmers have to go to meetings.

Real applications programmers go home at 5 o'clock.

Real applications  programmers  are  convinced  the  movie  TRON  is  about
applications programming.  Who else thinks of the User as a god?

Real applications programmers don't know anyone on third shift.

Real applications programmers  work  in  places  like  Merrimack  and  West
Concord.  No real applications programmer works in the Mill or Spit Brook.

Real applications programmers  work  for  Colonel  Crawford,  at  least  in
spirit.

Real applications programmers see no difference  between  Coke  and  Pepsi.
They drink decaffeinated coffee with cream and sugar.

Real applications programmers feel daring and guilty when they use GO TOs.

Real applications programmers talk to users.  Politely.

Real applications programmers don't go to DECUS.

Real applications programmers have worked for insurance companies.

Real applications programmers read the User's Guide before looking  in  the
Reference Manual.

Real  applications  programmers  read  books  by  James  Martin,  including
Applications Development Without Programmers, which they read to figure out
their options.

Real applications programmers know what checkpointing really means.

Real applications programmers write from COBOL  templates  and  cannibalize
their own programs.

Real applications programmers know what BSAs are, and want to grow up to be
just like them.

Real applications programmers write programs for people, not machines.

All this talk about cricket, American football, and basketball reminds
me of a true story involving John McGraw, the great manager of the old
New York Giants baseball team, and King George V (grandson of Victoria,
grandfather of Elizabeth II, ruler of Great Britain from 1910-1935).

During a visit to the United States, King George attended a ballgame
at the old Polo Grounds as a guest of the Giants.  He sat in the stands
with McGraw, who explained the game's action to him.

At one point, a Giant player bunted a teammate from first to second.
McGraw said to the King, "Our man bunted, your Majesty -- he
sacrificed his turn at bat so that our other player could move into
scoring position."

The king considered this for a few moments and then replied, "Rather
sporting of the chap, what?"

In the third volume of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy,
"Life, the Universe, and Everything," cricket is revealed to be the
playing out of an unpleasant racial memory.  I recommend the book
heartily to everyone who is or isn't interested in cricket.

    While thoroughly enjoying the wry wit and brilliance of Neil Lincoln of
    CDC's Cyber 205 project at today's seminar in Marlboro (could he be the
    Garrison  Keillor  of computers, what Gordon would sound like if he came
    out  in order and with humor?), I was brought up short by the man's use
    of  the  term  "complify" in opposition to "simplify". Not that I fault
    the  logic...  he  could  have  as  reasonably  chosen  "simplicate," I
    suppose.  But  it did remind me of the exciting times, now some Summers
    ago,  when  my first born was beginning to master the mother tounge and
    came   up   with   such   jewels   as  "down-side-up"  (as  opposed  to
    up-side-down.)  Anyone care to contribute?

You may remember that yesterday I reported on a brand new word, complify,
used in a lecture to replace complicate.  (Apparently the speaker, having
a love of symmetry often found in computer folk, needed a more balanced
opposite for "simplify.")  Well today's lecture topped that!  Uncomplify!
Note how one can use this sort of bootstrapping process to rewrite entire
areas of language.  It reminds me of the way a PDP-10 BLT instruction can
be used to bootstrap its way through memory wiping out whole segments!

Here is the criteria we in VAX Base Products Marketing developed for a
VAX "Cluster" name:

 1.  Include reference to VAX - to build on industry brand awareness.
 2.  Describe a single entity - any collection of VAX components which
     includes the CI.
 3.  Commonly used in singular form - the XXXXX is singular (even
     though consisting of multiple VAXes).  More than one XXXXX is
     able to take on the plural form.
 4.  Carries no VAX-like number - the XXXXX can consist of many VAX
     components and must not be associated uniquely with any one of
     them.
 5.  Conveys a product message - a new way to build systems; extending
     VAX in a new dimension to new applications - high availability,
     high performance.
 6.  Catchy, probably short, to-the-point, easy-to-say and write.
 7.  A name which will be remembered identified or associated with
     Digital, VAX.
 8.  Trademark-able.
 9.  Unique, conveys VAX, CI uniqueness
10.  In a form capable of accepting future VAX products -
            VENUS, SCORPIO, NAUTILUS, RAXX will be components of XXXXX
11.  Comparable to other current and planned extensions to VAX and
     Digital products - examples: VIA, microVAX, microPDP11
12.  Not just VAX, more than VAX.
13.  Long lasting -  it has to last 8-10 years

The current "straw horse":  ultraVAX

Other names considered and not selected:  multiVAX, VAXplex, VAX/XL,
OmniVAX, DECade, Uniplex, VAX PACE, HyperVAX, SuperVAX, ULTRAnet,
DECplex.

If you do not agree with the criteria, please change it.  If you have

First potpourrus (a la hippopotamI):

The recent banter about whether IBM builds its PC or not prompted me
to kick in this somewhat related tidbit.

All you hackers out there who peruse the tail end of Byte magazine
for deals on chips and hardware you'll never really get around to
using have probably seen the ad for the "Big Board".  The "Big Board",
also known as the "Ferguson", is a single-board Z80 system chock-full
of RAM and all kindza peripheral chips.   It's a lot of stuff for the
money, but looks pretty much like one of the million other California-
garage-shop products on the market.

It's a little known fact that this board is basically the Xerox 820.
Xerox bought the design for the board from Ferguson, whoever he is,
laid it out differently, put it in a box, and called it the Xerox 820.

Second potpourrus:

Speaking of PC's, have you noticed something about the TV commercials
for DEC's and TI's PC's ?   They're interchangeable !!!

Third potpourrus:

"...getting it up on her Apple..." reminded me of this one.  During my
RCA days, I worked on the Aegis system, affectionately spoken of by the
Navy as "the shield of the fleet".  It's a cruiser-  or frigate-based
system designed to protect a fleet of ships.   We often spoke of RCA's
mission being to equip the Navy with

                 "Aegis Protective Shields".

Fourth potpourrus:

I heartily endorse Cibachrome.  The color quality is outstanding.  I
don't quite understand why it's so expensive, though.  I've had a few
Cibachrome prints made that were not quite a decimal order of magnitude
higher than the standard + to - to + process.  Being a positive-to-positive,
process, Cibachrome eliminates a step, and all my photography friends say
that the parameters of the process are very forgiving.  Maybe it's just
a low volume business.

There's a Cibachrome while-you-wait place in Downtown Boston.  In
Government Center, just across the street from Quincy Market.  I had
some stuff done there a few months ago -- looks good.  5x7's are about
$5.00, 8x10's about $8.00.  The woman who runs the machine knows her
stuff -- she crops and balances the picture (and you can look over her
shoulder, too.)   The whole thing is done while you wait, or you can
leave it overnight for a lower price.

Also, while I know that "its" is the possesive form of "it", I don't
know *why* there is no apostrophe.   Maybe I should have studied
secretarial science.
