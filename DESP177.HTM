Subj:   Ken's smarter than you think

When Ken Olsen made his famous remark about the world not needing personal
computers, he was misquoted.  What he really said was, "The world has no need
for DIGITAL personal computers."

Ken was once again far ahead of his time in his understanding.

Here are some real headlines, randomly generated by the journalists of
India from the database of India.  These are from an article in the Wall
Street Journal, which notes, "Indian journalists actually pursue their
craft quite seriously and vigorously - and enjoy perhaps the greatest
freedom in the developing world."

        Monkey Slaps Woman to Death

        Man Kills Son for Own Cure

        World's Longest Moustached Man Beheaded

        Jobless Dies Waiting for Interview

        Man's Head Found in Drain

        13 Human Heads Recovered From Sweeper's House

        Surplus European Cows for India

        Forced to Live with Cattle

        Caution Against Drugged Ice-Cream

        Daughter Mortgaged

        4-year-old Sacrificed for Treasure

        Man Killed in Quarrel Over Parking Space

The article notes the interesting English of the Indian press:  "Cars
'dash' against trees, ploice 'swing into action' and drunken 'miscreant'
bus drivers - the cause of those world-famed crashes - are ever 'absconding.'"

Appropriately, "Then there are highly popular language columns which speak
with distinctly Indian accents.  Consider this from the Hindu's 'Know Your
English': 'Mr. S. Prakash, Vellalar Street, Mutharasanallur, Tiruchi, wants
to know the difference between "shaving" and "pogonotomy."'"

    An article about Richard Stallman that appeared on the front page of the NYT

Cher wins an Academy Award, Sonny wins a municipal election, ketchup is

increasing credibility.  The nineties can't come soon enough, eh?

        Computer 'worm' Cripples Digital Facility

Nashua, NH (AP) - A computer 'worm' infiltrated Digital's Spit Brook facility,
bringing the sophisticated computer systems to a virtual halt.  The Spit Brook
facility is the computer giant's flagship of software engineering and
geek-like human replicas.

The virus entered the computer systems in the early hours of the weekend and
proceeded to multiply itself in the intestines of the computer systems like a
Fenway frank.  The symptoms were similar: severe discomfort, followed by
cycles of nausea and purging.

A source who insisted on anonymity assessed the damage.  "Imagine being on the
world's largest private network, with access to information throughout the
world, some of it even work related, and suddenly, out of nowhere, you're
forced to do your job and even communicate with other people."

Indeed, Health Services reports that many engineers are suffering from "Notes
Withdrawal," a usually benign disorder that can become fatal if left
untreated.  Symptoms include increased productivity, interest in other people,
and a more balanced life.

Subj:   On the recent virus

What is "random"?

    The recent virus set loose here at DEC used a "random" number
    generator to generate "random" node addresses, but they weren't
    random enough.  I started looking into this because my node was
    getting hit by infected nodes more often that other nodes I knew of
    (quite annoying!)

    It turns out that my node was selected by the "random" generator
    about 23 times more often than a good random number generator.  "Why
    is this so?"

    Basically, what looks random often is not.  The virus read the
    system clock and used the tenth of a second digit and the current
    second.  This may SEEM random, but it's not distributed uniformly.
    It's like using loaded dice or a coin with 2 heads and a tail.

       :-)    :-)    (=)

    So, to those who use random number generators: be wary of random
    number generators that you "whip-up" or inherit.  Library routines
    are often a better choice (and you may still want to check whether a
    particular generator meets your needs).

       After the Morris incident many of them just circled the wagons.  Tom
       Knight [Hi there, Tom], a professor of computer science at MIT, told
       _The_Washington_Post_, "The job of a university is to distribute
       information, not to keep it secret."  But the fact is that MIT's
       libraries aren't open to everyone who can read.  There's no reason
       why its computers should be open to everyone who can program.

Actually, MIT's libraries ARE open to everyone who can read.  Just
walk into any MIT library.  They don't ask for an ID at the door or
anything.  (It's great.)  Did the reporter just pick a bad example or
is his answer to TK really wrong?

    "For example, in this system, there can be *no* default values for any
    'measurement' item.  This is because the units of any measurement item is
    determined by the 'units-per-measurement' item of the 'measurement-units'
    item.  So, if we were to give a measurement item a default value, the item
    would get the default's value, but said value would be semantically
    processed in whatever units the file was currently working in -- thus, the
    default value would be essentially random!  [Note:  the exeception is a
    default value of zero, which remains zero in any unit system.]"

Oh, yeah?  I wonder if the software being described can represent
temperatures in Farenheit and Celsius.  Anyway, what a fine example
of confusion!

Thanks again, Desperado is lots of fun!
