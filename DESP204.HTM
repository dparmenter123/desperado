What sort of literature do you expect from someone whose name is an
elision of "fulsome" and "sorghum"?

Subj:   Author of the article about the King and his Toaster

I forwarded a copy of the story about the King and his two advisors working
w/ a toaster to a friend of mine.  My friend thought that it was not good
form to copy an entire article w/o citing the author.  According to my friend,
that article came form the following source:

        The story is from a column titled "The Breakfast Food Cooker" by
        Do-While Jones (I'm not making this up, you know) in the June, 1990
        issue of Computer Language magazine.

jcf

                                    =*=

        People named Do-While don't get no respect.  As I said when I ran
        the disputed item, it wasn't clear from my source who the author
        was, but I was interested to find out.  Is that bad form?  Has
        this never happened to Do-While before now?

        And, many years ago, someone wrote "DIGITAL designs a cake mix".
        Basically the same article.  I never found out who wrote that one.

        I guess it's a sign of increasing circulation, but I seem to be
        starting out more issues with explanations of this or that outrage
        that I've committed. All submissions to Desperado are made in good
        faith. I've never had anyone try to pass off anything as their own
        that was not their own.  "I'd like to play you a little tune I
        wrote.  I call it 'Beethoven's Ninth'." That has never happened so
        far as I know.   Sometimes, however, through the vagaries of
        network headers or my editing of them, it may *appear* that
        someone is claiming to have written something that they did not in
        fact write.

        What often happens is that somebody sees something entertaining
        somewhere on the net and sends it to me and I stick it in here.  I
        do that all the time.  It is the essence of Desperado.  If there's
        no attribution, I print it anyway.  If you see something you
        wrote, or some pal of yours wrote, or Thomas Paine wrote and it is
        unattributed or misattributed, send me mail and let me know and
        I'll correct it.

        I certainly want everybody to get all the credit that is due them,
        but as that Apple Fellow said at that conference I went to,
        "Digital technology is the universal solvent of intellectual
        property rights."

        I make a reasonable effort, by which I mean not very much more
        than studying the headers, to try to figure out who the author is,
        and then I press on.  Part of my added value is stripping most of
        the headers *off*.  If I'm going to do Desperado at all, and I
        intend to continue, it has to be without much more checking than
        that.  My theory, arrogant thought it may sound (and even be), is
        that my audience is more interested in the joke than in who first
        told it, even an originator.  My only defense is that it happens
        to me all the time.  My name appears at the top and bottom of
        Desperado.  Else, readers have to know that the indented stuff,
        like this or the stuff encased in vertical bars, is mine, but
        anyone with an editor can rip me (or anyone else) right out of
        context and ship us off to God knows where.

        Remember, if it shows up in here, that means that at least two
        people thought it was interesting and worth passing along.  It's
        a compliment.

        Way back in the 60s, Vice President of the United States and real
        rich man, Nelson "What a way to go" Rockefeller, said, in his most
        phamous aforism:  "If you don't want it known, don't use the
        phone."

        Thus,  I devised these:

        "It'll travel like a jet if you put it on the net"

        "If you want to keep it as a pet, keep it off the net."

        "It's credit roulette when you put it on the net."

        "Credit?  Forget it.  You put it on the net."

        And now, switching from words to deeds, we begin. From a marketing
        document out there somewhere:

                1. IBM must regain mind-share to reverse the
                   negative-momentum of the past four years."

        technoband Tangerine Dream:

        Can you verify the story my son Dan told me?  During the last
        computer virus attack, one of the local TV stations went to MIT to
        hear from the experts at the AI lab.  One of the experts had a
        Mandelbrot diagram building on his screen.  "This is a map of the
        network," he said, as the camera zoomed in.  "This dark spot here
        is the virus.  You can see it expanding now as it infects more and
        more systems."

    PIZZA DELIVERY MAN ROBBED BY 2 THIEVES AND SNAPPING TURTLE.

    Balch Springs, Texas-AP-

     Where were the crime-fighting, pepperoni pizza-munching Teenage
    Mutant Ninja Turtles when Domino's delivery man Troy Brewer really
    needed them? After all, they may have known his alleged hard-shelled
    attacker.
     Brewer said he was at a pay phone when he was robbed by a pair of
    thieves armed with a snapping turtle. "That sucker was going to bite
    me," he said. "They put him right up to my face."

     The toothsome turtle didn't nip the flustered pizza delivery man,
    but those wielding the turtle got away with his money pouch containing
    about $50, he said. "Don't move or you're gonna get bit," Brewer said
    robbers told him.

     Brewer, a college student who works in Balch Springs, filed a
    police complaint in Dallas because he said Tuesday night's robbery
    occurred just inside the city limits.

     Balch Springs Assistant Police Chief B.W. Smith said it was the
    first robbery at turtle-point he's ever heard of.

     "I suppose if he said it happened, I guess it did. Personally,
    I just can't see somebody holding somebody up with a turtle,"
    he said.

Probably the most bizarre Grumman American (a manufacturer of
single engine 2 and 4 seat airplanes) accident was when a
pilot who was well beyond his fatigue limit, landed at a
remote airport and fell asleep in his seat immediately after
he shut the engine down.

He woke up later and while still groggy and disoriented,
thought he had fallen asleep while flying and the engine had
quit. He went through the in-flight start procedure, rammed in
full throttle, and taxied through a couple of parked planes.

&gt;From _Boston Computer Currents_, Vol. 5, #7, July 1990, p. 14

        "From Lotus, With Love"

   Lotus Development Corp.  (Cambridge, Mass.), long known for its social
consciousness, is once more making a contribution, and I don't mean some
corporate check written ceremoniously in the president's office.

   This time, Lotus is offering a deeply personal love letter to the world,
in the form of a book of poetry written by Lotus employees, family, and
friends, to benefit AIDS care.

   For many, the beauty of the computer world is its shining logic,
mathematical symmetry and safe distance from human emotion.  This book
embodies none of that.  This book is from the hearts of the people who make
up Lotus and it could well change forever your perception of what a giant
corporation is.

   Here is a small sample of poetry, by an anonymous writer with the
pseudonym of Miroslav Jarek.

        Obbligato I

        ...we are
        travelling now, we
        are shaking earth
        and travelling, we
        are crossing boundaries,
        we are leading
        ourselves for once
        others will follow.

   "With Love, Lotus," a 102-page softcover volume, can be obtained for a
$5.00 donation to: Lotus Development Corp., c/o Lovebook Order Fulfillment,
P.O.  Box 9158, Cambridge, MA 02139.  Or call 800/345-1043.  Credit cards

Right, and last week Lotus got a love letter from Richard Stallman and
Patrick Winston in the form of a picket line protesting their "look and
feel" lawsuits.  The complaint is that Lotus isn't living up to the
sentiments of the poem printed here.  That is, they crossed boundaries and
then locked the door behind them.  Does Lotus fix bugs in their poetry?

The Stallman organization, the League for Programming Freedom, is staging
regular demos outside Lotus.  Write to Stallman at rms@prep.ai.mit.edu.
He just got one of them MacArthur Foundation Genius Grants.

Suggested slogans for signs at the demo, from their press release:

        BOYCOTT LOTUS                   KEEP YOUR LAWYERS OFF MY COMPUTER

and, big finish now,

        USERS WANT COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE

At their last demo, they were doing "1-2-3-4" type cheers, but counting in
hex.  Surely we can do a little better than that.  Let's see . . .

I couldn't quite credit my ears or eyes the other night, but I could swear
I saw a Public Service Announcement on one of the local TV stations, urging

Now I'm not one of the cranky anti-taxers (though I don't think that makes
me "pro" tax) always grousing about waste and inefficiency in state gummint;
but it does strike me as a touch ludicrous to spend money telling people
why it's a good idea to come to a full stop at the next red light they
encounter, when the simple expedient of having a state trooper at the inter-
section of Rtes 2 and 126 would have the doubly-beneficial effect of adding
considerable income to the state's coffers and getting across the very
message contained in the ad. I'm sure we'd cover the cost of the ad in the

Newsgroups: rec.humor.funny
Subject: Dark Sucker
                        DARKNESS, BE GONE !

        For years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted
light.  However, recent information has proven otherwise.  Electric
headlight bulbs don't emit light; they suck dark.  Thus, we will
call these bulbs DARK SUCKERS.  The Dark Sucker Theory proves the
existence of dark, that dark has mass heavier than that of light,
and that dark is faster than light.

        The BASIS OF THE DARK SUCKER THEORY is that electric bulbs
suck dark.  Take for example the dark suckers in the room where
you are.  There is less dark right next to them than there is
elesewhere.  The larger the dark sucker, the greater its capacity
to suck dark.  Dark suckers in a parking lot have a much greater
capacity than the ones in this room.  As with all things, dark suckers
don't last forever.  Once they are full of dark, they can no longer
suck.  This is proven by the black spot on a full dark sucker.

        A CANDLE IS A PRIMITIVE DARK SUCKER.  A new candle has a
white wick.  You will notice that after first use, the wick turns
black, representing all the dark which has been sucked into it.  If
you hold a pencil next to the wick of an operating candle, the tip
will turn black, because it got in the way of the dark flowing into
the candle.  Unfortunately, these primitive dark suckers have a very
limited range.

        There are also PORTABLE DARK SUCKERS.  The bulbs in these
can't handle all of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by dark
storage unit(s) in the handle.  When the dark storage unit is full,
it must be either emptied or replaced before the portable dark
sucker can operate again.

        DARK HAS MASS:  When dark goes into a dark sucker, friction
from this mass generates heat.  Thus, it is not wise to touch an
operating dark sucker.  Candles present a special problem as the
dark must travel into the solid wick, instead of through glass.  This
generates a great amount of heat.  Thus, it can be very dangerous to
touch an operating candle.

DARK IS ALSO HEAVIER THAN LIGHT:  If you go swimming, just below the
surface of a lake you will see a lot of light.  If you swim deeper
and deeper, you notice it slowly gets darker and darker.  When you
reach a depth of approximately 50 feet, you are in total darkness.
This is because the heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake and
the lighter dark floats to the top.

        The IMMENSE POWER OF DARK can be utilized to man's advantage.
We can collect the dark that has settled to the bottom of lakes, and
push it through turbines which generate electricity and helps push
dark to the ocean where it may be safely stored.  Prior to turbines,
it was much more difficult to get dark from the rivers and lakes to
the ocean.  The Indians recognized this problem and tried to solve
it.  When on a river, in a canoe, traveling in the same direction as
the flow of dark, they paddled slowly, so as not to stop the flow of
dark; but when they traveled against the dark, they paddled quickly,
so as to help push the dark along its way.

        Finally, we must prove that DARK IS FASTER THAN LIGHT.  If you
were to stand in an illuminated room on front of a closed, dark closet,
then slowly open the closet door, you would see the light slowly enter
the closet; but since the dark is so fast, you would not be able to
see the dark leave the closet.

        In conclusion, I would like to say that dark suckers make all
our lives much easier.  So the next time you look at an electric bulb,
remember that it is indeed a dark sucker.

      "Del Shannon had this big, tough, barrel-chested voice, yet at the
      key moment in his biggest hit, 'Runaway,' it leapt into an alarming
      falsetto, as if a mugger had grabbed his testicles.  He nearly always
      used the same trick, though in his worst song, the unforgivable
      'Swiss Maid,' it appeared as a yodel which sounded like the siren on
      the Third World police van."

   From Tim Horgan's column in the Boston Herald:  A baseball statistics
   junkie named Hermes has calculated what he calls the single most
   important stat for pitchers: the percent difference between the
   pitcher's won-lost average and the won-lost average of the teams he
   pitched for.  The leaders in this category aren't suprising.  They
   include the greatest pitcher of all time, the greatest lefty of the
   modern era, and so on.  The real surprise is the gap between the leader
   and the rest---Roger Clemens, whose won-lost percentage is .688 for
   Red Sox teams whose won-lost percentage is .530.  Here's the list
   that Horgan gives:

        1.  Roger Clemens  .158
        2.  Dwight Gooden  .115
        6.  Tom Seaver  .101
        8.  Cy Young  .100
        9.  Lefty Grove  .099
       11.  Smokey Joe Wood  .098
       14.  Sal Maglie  .090

       25.  Tex Hughson  .065
       28.  Bob Gibson  .060
       31.  Warren Spahn  .053

&gt;Ah, the mysterious insertion and removal of "data", always a difficulty.
&gt;Yes, why would somebody take out the sequence numbers (a specialite de
&gt;FORTRAN) and then forward it on to where I ended up with it?  Maybe the
&gt;message passed through a FORTRAN compiler somewhere along the way?

Maybe it was passed through PIP-10 twice with /E and /T switches:

"
@ty kl1026""::hlp:pip.hlp
...
/E          For card reader input, ignores card sequence numbers.   In
            other  words,  this  switch replaces characters in columns
            73-80 with spaces.  This switch can be used with  the  /A,
            /C, /G, /J, /M, /N, /O, /Q, /S, /X, and /Z switches.
...
/T          Deletes trailing spaces from the transferred file.   Keeps
            one  space  and  the line terminator for an all-space line.
            You may use /C, /S, and /Z with this switch.

Tom,

I wondered how many people will write in to say that the pi mnemonics agree for
thirteen digits, disagree on one digit, then agree again for the next seven
digits.

No, I don't know which is correct. For non-mathematical reasons I suspect the
second ditty: the suggestion of error in 'Euclidian arts imperfect are, my boy'
and repeated use of arts in the next line make me think this may be an example
of the dark side of memory aids. Or of a poet with a sense of mischief and a
very dry sense of humor.

                THE HOMELY AND MOURNFUL SQUONK OF PENNSYLVANIA

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        From "The Book of Imaginary Beings" by Jorge Luis Borges

        The Squonk (Lacrimacorpus dissolvens)

        The range of the squonk is very limited.  Few people outside of
        Pennsylvania have ever heard of the quaint beast, which is said to
        be fairly common in the hemlock forests of that State.  The squonk
        is of a very retiring disposition, generally traveling about at
        twilight and dusk.  Because of its misfitting skin, which is
        covered with warts and moles, it is always unhappy; in fact it is
        said, by poeple who are best able to judge, to ge the most morbid
        of beasts.  Hunters who are good at tracking are able to follow a
        squonk by its tear-stained trail, for the animal weeps constantly.
        When cornered and escape seems impossible, or when surprised and
        frightened, it may even dissolve itself in tears.  Squonk hunters
        are most successful on frosty moonlight nights, when tears are
        shed slowly and the animal dislikes moving about; it may be heard
        weeping under the boughs of dark hemlock trees.  Mr. J. P.
        Wentling, formerly of Pennsylvania, but now at St. Anthony Park,
        Minnesota, had a disappointing experience with a squonk near Mont
        Alto.  He made a clever capture by mimicking the squonk and
        inducing it to hop into a sack, in which he was carrying it home,
        when suddnly the burden lightened and the weeping ceased.
        Wentling unslung the sack and looked in.  There was nothing but
        tears and bubbles.

I wonder if this guy knows he's dealing with thorpes.

From: Tom@dupr.ocs.drexel.edu (Tom Schiavinato)
Subject: Stuck shift key poetry

The following poem is excerpted with permission from Lee Leitner's
"Viewpoint" column which is featured in a bimonthly periodical for
Prime INFORMATION users called INFOCUS magazine. The original authors
were Fred Bremmer and Steve Kroese of Calvin College &amp; Seminary of
Grand Rapids, MI.

FYI - a "wahka" is the decidedly "proper" (by popular vote) name for
the characters "&gt;" and "&lt;". This is in spite of INFOCUS readers of
Denver who still refer to them as "Norkies". The Michigan crowd
apparently has corrupted the spelling to "waka".

To wit, it is -
------------------------------------------------------------
 "...a poem we think is about the lowly wahka. Maybe. Well,
  perhaps---we're really not sure what the poem actually is
  about. Here it goes:"

    &lt;&gt;!*''#
    ^@`$$-
    !*'$_
    %*&lt;&gt;#4
    &amp;)../
    |{~~SYSTEM HALTED

Transliterated:

    Waka waka bang splat tick tick hash,
    Caret at back-tick dollar dollar dash,
    Bang splat tick dollar under-score,
    Percent splat waka waka number four,
    Ampersand right-paren dot dot slash,
    Vertical-bar curly-bracket tilde tilde CRASH.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, "waka waka" is fun to say, but I can't believe that truly geeky nerds
could have allowed the confusion of two Boolean operator characters.  I
think you'd really have to say greater waka and lesser waka, each of which
scans the same as waka waka and leaves us with:

    &gt;!*''#
    ^@`$$-
    !*'$_
    %*&lt;#4
    &amp;)../
    |{~~SYSTEM HALTED

    Caret at back-tick dollar dollar dash,
    Bang splat tick dollar under-score,
    Percent splat lesser waka number four,
    Ampersand right-paren dot dot slash,
    Vertical-bar curly-bracket tilde tilde CRASH.

So, now it's an original work by me through the magic of universal solvent.

Some people say "in fingernails" for "in parentheses".

        How to Determine Which Programming Language You're Using:

     The proliferation of modern programming languages which seem to have
stolen countless features from each other sometimes makes it difficult to
remember which language you're using.  This guide is offered as a public
service to help programmers in such dilemmas.

C:         You shoot yourself in the foot.

Assembly:  You crash the OS and overwrite the root disk.  The system
           administrator arrives and shoots you in the foot.  After
           a moment of contemplation, the administrator shoots himself
           in the foot and then hops around the room rabidly shooting
           at everyone in sight.

APL:       You hear a gunshot, and there's a hole in your foot, but you
           don't remember enough linear algebra to understand what the
           hell happened.

C++:       You accidently create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot
           them all in the foot.  Providing emergency medical care
           is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies
           and which are just pointing at others and saying, "that's
           me, over there."

Ada:       If you are dumb enough to actually use this language, the
           United States Department of Defense will kidnap you,
           stand you up in front of a firing squad, and tell the
           soldiers, "Shoot at his feet."

Modula/2:  After realizing that you can't actually accomplish anything
           in the language, you shoot yourself in the head.

sh,
csh,etc.:  You can't remember the syntax for anything, so you spend five hours
           reading man pages before giving up.  You then shoot the computer
           and switch to C.

Smalltalk: You spend so much time playing with the graphics and windowing
           system that your boss shoots you in the foot, takes away your
           workstation, and makes you develop in COBOL on a character
           terminal.

FORTRAN:
        You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out
        of toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat.  If you run
        out of bullets, you continue anyway because you have no exception-
        processing ability.

Algol:
        You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket.  The musket is
        esthetically fascinating, and the wound baffles the adolescent
        medic in the emergency room.

COBOL:
        USEing a COLT45 HANDGUN, AIM gun at LEG.FOOT, THEN place
        ARM.HAND.FINGER on HANDGUN.TRIGGER, and SQUEEZE. THEN
        return HANDGUN to HOLSTER.  Check whether shoelace needs
        to be retied.

BASIC:
        Shoot self in foot with water pistol.  On big systems, continue
        until entire lower body is waterlogged.

PL/I:
        You consume all available system resources, including all the
        offline bullets.  The DataProcessing&amp;Payroll Department doubles
        its size, triples its budget, acquires four new mainframes, and
        drops the original one on your foot.

SNOBOL:
        You grab your foot with your hand, then rewrite your hand to
        be a bullet.  The act of shooting the original foot then
        changes your hand/bullet into yet another foot (a left foot).

lisp:
        You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with
        which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun
        with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the
        gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds...

scheme:
        You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with
        which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun
        with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the
        gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds...
        ...but none of the other appendages are aware of this happening.

English:
        You put your foot in your mouth, then bite it off.

From:    gls@Think.COM (Guy Steele)

It appears that when I sent out that text describing Lisp as a house
and C as a pickup truck, not everyone recognized the line

20-Apr-88 02:21    Skef.Wholey@SPICE.CS.CMU.EDU See, Lithp, See!

as a mail header.  (I did, because when I was at CMU I used to use
the mail-handling program that generates that format.)  Some of you
therefore got the wrong impression that I was the author.

To give credit where it is due: Skef Wholey came up with that
metaphor and wrote the text two years ago (April 1988).  I came
across it today and remailed it for your dining and dancing pleasure.

--guy

    [...]

      Lisp is a big, comfortable house.  It costs serious money.  It comes
    furnished, with countless rooms full of useful appliances and fun toys,
    toys that can be used (or misused) as appliances, and appliances that
    are so fun to use they may as well be toys.  The furniture is
    comfortable.  There are very few sharp objects or corners in the house;
    it's hard to hurt yourself unless you really try.  The most dangerous
    (and to some, the most fun) part of the house is the basement, where
    strange, primitive, powerful machines sit humming in the darkness.  (You
    don't have to go down to the basement unless you want to.)  Building
    additions onto the house (above ground) is easy, especially if you've
    got a big yard.

      C is pickup truck with a matress thrown in the back.  You can take it
    anywhere: down an alley, up a mountain, or even into someone's basement
    (!).  Cost is nothing compared to a house, and it lets you get your job
    done, but there's no chance in hell you're gonna spend you retirement
    there.  Scattered all over the bed of the truck, on all sides of your
    mattress, and up in the cab, filling the passenger seat, are various
    nasty tools.  Saws of different sizes (char, short, int, long),
    screwdrivers, hammers.  Everything you need to, say, build a house.
    Sometimes as you drive along the tools bounce around and hit you.  Your
    body is covered with bruises and your hands with calluses, but you think
    that makes you look tough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great analogy!  Lets extend it a little....

What about when you want to build a bridge or a house?  The lisp
programmer thinks about it a little bit and says "It won't fit into any
of my rooms so it's not worth building!"

Also, what about the operating system?  Where does UNIX fit in?  Its a
TEAMSTERS union card of course!  The C programmer is happy to be a
member of the union.  He can get together with a whole bunch of other
guys with pickup trucks and build almost anything.  Everybody's a
little specialized. Some guys have makefiles and shell scripts in the
back of their trucks.  Others have lex and yacc.  Everything fits
together (more or less) and everybody goes out for a beer at the USENIX
conference after its all done.

The poor lisp programmer is baffled by all this.  He needs a union card
to get a job, but he doesn't need anybody's help to build anything he's
interested in.  To make matters worse, every now and then union members
invite themselves into his house! They track their muddy boots over his
nice carpets and they run ugly wires down into his basement while
mumbling about "making good use of all those wasted cycles"!

        Westley loves me.
        Westley loves me, not.
        Westley loves me.

Anyway, the C code is far more interesting than the output.

I understand this won't compile in VAX 'C', not that I've tried it.  Is
that bad form, to circulate untested code?  I'll bet some of you've seen
this a dozen times and some not at all.  Ah well, it's only ones and zeros
as Andy Bodge says.

Tomorrow, I'll be 50 years old.  And, no, it's no big deal to me, except
we're having friends and cheeseburgers and brewskies, and a present or
two.  And maybe some fireworks.  The only birthday that ever got to me was
my 25th, when it dawned on me that I wasn't going to live forever.  I put
that thought right behind me and haven't worried about a birthday since
then.  Phyllis Diller is 73. She asks in her act:  "Who wants to be 73?"
The answer:  "People who are 72."  There are a lot worse things than
getting old.  World War I started on my birthday in 1914.

So, if one or two of you would file this away so it'll get backed up so
I'll live forever, I'd appreciate it.

Good news, by the way, I've dug out the Desperado archives and I'll be
putting them in a public directory, accessible at least to Digits.  Is
there some place outside DEC where a read-only directory could reside for
the benefit of nonDigits?  I have no idea how big the damn thing is
because we haven't loaded the tape yet.

So, best regards to all,
Your buddy,

Tom Parmenter

PS - I've asked hundreds of people, but only two have figured out that I
was a Leo.  If there's anything at all to astrology, I'm the most obvious
Leo I ever saw.
