        From a Cinemax movie:  Slick Operator is sitting in his car with
        Beautiful Young Girl.

        Slick is trying to convince Girl not to ditch him by telling her
        what great things he has in store for her: "This town is strictly
        small time.  I'm going to take you to Buffalo!"

        Slick gets out of the car for the usual reason and Girl slides over
        into the driver's seat and takes off.

Subj:   some humor

In the beginning, God created the bit.  And the bit was a zero; nothing.

On the first day, He toggled the 0 to a 1, and the Universe was.
(In those days, bootstrap loaders were simple, and "active low" signals
didn't yet exist.)

On the second day, God's boss wanted a demo, and tried to read the bit.
This being volatile memory, the bit reverted to a 0.  And the universe wasn't.
God learned the importance of backups and memory refresh, and spent the rest
of the day (and his first all-nighter) reconstructing the universe.

On the third day, the bit cried "Oh, Lord!  If you exist, give me a sign!"
And God created rev 2.0 of the bit, even better than the original prototype.
Those in Universe Marketing immediately realized that "new and improved"
wouldn't do justice to such a grand and glorious creation.  And so it was
dubbed the Most Significant Bit, or the Sign bit.  Many bits followed, but
only one was so honored.

On the fourth day, God created a simple ALU with 'add' and 'logical shift'
instructions.  And the original bit discovered that by performing a
single shift instruction, it could become the Most Significant Bit.
And God realized the importance of computer security.

On the fifth day, God created the first mid-life kicker, rev 2.0 of the ALU,
with wonderful new features, and said "Screw that add and shift stuff.
Go forth and multiply."  And God saw that it was good.

On the sixth day, God got a bit overconfident, and invented pipelines,
register hazards, optimizing compilers, crosstalk, restartable instructions,
microinterrupts, race conditions, and propagation delays.  Historians have
used this to convincingly argue that the sixth day must have been a Monday.

On the seventh day, an engineering change introduced [name of buggy
component deleted to keep lawyers happy] into the Universe, and it
hasn't worked right since.

        "Blue Moon":  When Sha-na-na did this one, they suddenly got very
        serious, bending over to watch their tablatures as they left the
        familiar three chords behind.

        "Why do fools fall in love?":  The eternal question.

        "Get a Job":  The Silhouettes were some kind of radicals,
        apparently.  They wrote this song and then followed it up with
        "We're headed for the poorhouse" in which the complaint was that
        "all our money turned brown", surely the only anti-inflation song
        in rock&amp;roll history.

        "Whole lotta shakin' goin' on":  A real event lies behind this song
        in which the songwriters were invited to come on over across a lake
        to join in the party by someone ringing a huge bell, the
        "ding-dong" that gets mentioned.  This is another of those cases,
        like "Hound Dog" where a white male covers a song by a black female
        and totally blows the original black female version out of reality.
        That would be Willie Mae Thornton for "Hound Dog" and Big Maybelle
        on "Whole Lotta".  Clear evidence in both cases that rhythm&amp;blues
        was due for a good housecleaning.

        "O, what a nite":  The Dells just keep on keepin' on, still
        together after all these years, and what a romantic classic that
        was.

Subj:   thoughts about Desperado #3047 and war

I was at an impressionable age when "Question Authority" became a widely quoted
slogan.  This may explain why I have an almost instinctive reaction to doubt
-- to be honest, I should say "disbelieve" -- what The Experts have to say
about any given subject, especially when they are in agreement.

So I was immediately skeptical when I read, in Desperado #3047, that

        "all students of the era agreed" that the conquest [of the Japanese
        home islands at the end of WW II] was
        unecessarily brutal, that many civilians died unnecessarily,  and
        that the war was unquestionably won before any of this happened.
        The A-bombs weren't even mentioned. although obviously they made
        their contribution to the truth of the statement.

It's not clear to me what constitutes unnecessary brutality, as opposed to the
necessary variety.  Perhaps the Japanese survivors of the Allied conquest could
discuss the point with those who lived through the Japanese conquest of much of
China, or those who were in Poland when Germany attacked in 1939, or those who
were in Berlin late in the war.  For a broader perspective, we could include
some civilians who went through the recent Gulf War.  If we include a
representative sampling of civilians who lived (or didn't) through all recent
wars, of course, those who went through nuclear attacks will be a pretty small
minority.

I'm also not sure exactly what is meant by the statement that the war was "won"
before the attacks on the Japanese home islands, but I suspect that this point
might be disputed by some of those who were still fighting that war at the
time. (Imagined conversation from somewhere in the Pacific in 1945:  "Hey, Joe,
did you hear that the war unquestionably has been won?"  "Get your head down,
you idiot, they're shooting at us!")  The fact that they were actually there,
of course, might jeopardize their status as objective "students of the era".

But the really interesting part of the commentary came at the end.

        This matter-of-fact remark would have gotten you tried for
        treason if you'd uttered it in 1945 and would have gotten you
        pilloried by politicians and the public press if you'd uttered it
        anytime between 1946 and say 1962, singled out as a softy and
        probably a Red, and yet, by 1991 it is acknowledged, accepted,
        well-known by "all students of the era".

        If we live in an information age, and we always say we do, maybe
        the experts will get their consensus together a little more rapidly
        on the small, medium, and large wars the US has participated in
        since then.

I think it quite likely that the "information age" will allow our "experts" to
reach a consensus more quickly on this and other issues.  (Wars in which the US
does not play a direct part also are interesting.)  Of course, it also will
allow them to change their minds, and reach a new consensus, equally quickly.
Even now, it takes a lot less than four decades for a statement to pass from
the realm of treason to "accepted and acknowledged" and back again.

I've been closer than I would have preferred to a couple of wars, and the issue
of civilian deaths has not gone unnoticed.  The only conclusion that I've
reached is that it's not a question that lends itself to easy answers.
Obviously, it's desirable that no civilians get killed in a war -- hell, it's
even better if nobody at all gets killed -- but I don't believe that these are
considerations that should absolutely override all others.

                        OBLIQUE PERSPECTIVE

                          By John Wharton

The story you are about to read is true. Identities have been
concealed to protect the enterprising.  Those of us who design and
build microcomputers usually think we have a pretty good idea of our
target markets and who the potential users may be. We're usually
wrong. If a product succeeds in the marketplace, its eventual uses will
extend far beyond the horizon foreseen during product definition.

Consider the following bizarre tale. I was driving to a friend's
wedding in southern California one snowy Saturday morning, already
running late, when a cloud of greasy smoke erupted from my dashboard.
I soon found myself in Tehachapi, CA (population 4,126) desperately
seeking a mechanic.

The third garage I came to looked open, so l knocked on the door and
went in. Just inside stood two coverall-clad mechanics who seemed to
be anxiously waiting for someone. They eyed my wedding garb
suspiciously, and I felt like I'd stumbled into a Miami Vice drug buy,
but after a while the older mechanic spoke up. "Did you bring the
PROMs?" he asked.

A very strange question, coming from a car mechanic, but I was in a
rush. "No," I answered, "I'm afraid all I've got is a broken-down
Toyota, and a desperate need to get going again as soon as possible."
The mechanics asked about the car's failure mode, maintenance
history, anti-freeze level, and so forth, to which my answers merely
showed how poorly I understood how cars work. I design computers for a
living, but automobile engines are black magic.

After realizing I'd be of no help at all, the mechanics began poking
under the hood, pressurizing the radiator, tracing the path of the
cooling-system hoses, unplugging connectors, and testing for leaks.
I was struck by how his actions resembled a computer designer
debugging a giant, grease-encrusted breadboard.  The Master Mechanic
concluded I had blown the heater oore in the dashboard, for which the
quickest fix would be to "short-circuit the core with a bypass hose,
which would hold me until the core could be replaced.  The computer
industry is not the only one with garage-shop hackers, I thought.

ENTER THE COMPUTER

Now, Tehachapi is chiefly a bedroom community for test pilots from
Edwards Air Force Base, hardly a hotbed of computer system design, so
the Mechanic's earlier question about PROMs had come as a surpise.
While his partner hacked away at the heater I/O hoses (literally, with
a knife), I asked the Master Mechanic what (in his business) the word
PROM meant.  "Oh, that," he replied. "PROMs are how microcomputers
store programs. We're rebuilding the engine computer in that Taurus
over there."  Great, I thought. Here was a topic I could relate to!
"I didn't know engine computers could be fixed," I said.  "I thought
you had to replace the whole assembly."  "Used to, you did," the
Mechanic replied. "Everything was soldered down and potted in resin,
but no more. If you can get the box open, you can swap chips until it
works. It's a lot cheaper than junking the whole board. Everything's
in Augat sockets now," he said, showing me an open module.  Augat
sockets! It had been ages since I'd heard hardware engineers sing the
praises of Augat sockets, certainly not what I'd expect here. The only
engineering circles in which Tehachapi is famous are of the railroad
variety, thanks to the Tehachapi Loop, an unusual switchback in the
tracks through a local mountain pass.  The conversation had taken an
unusual turn, but at least now I could show off my computer expertise
and soothe the battered ego I'd suffered from being so helpless under
the hood. "I actually design computers like that, up in Silicon
Valley," I began. "In fact, I developed Ford's very first engine
computer, back in the `70s."  That should impress him, I thought.  He
pondered briefly, then asked: "EEC-3 or -4?"  Damn! This guy was good.
"I thought it was EEC-1," I began, trying to remember the "electronic
engine control" designators. "It was the first time a computer..."
"Nah, EEC-1 and -2 used discrete parts," he interrupted. "EEC-3 was
the first with a microprocessor."  "That was it, then. It had an
off-the-shelf 8048."  "You mean you designed EEC-3?" the Master
Mechanic asked incredulously. "Hey, George!" he shouted to the guy
working under the hood. "When you're done fixing this guys car, push
it out back and torch it! He designed EEC-3!"

So much for impressing the Mechanic, huh? I shot back defensively.
"Did EEC-3 have a problem?"  "Reliability, mostly," he replied. "The
02-sensor brackets could break, and the connectors corroded."  I beat
a hasty retreat. "Those sound like hardware problems," I said. "All I
did was the sofflware."  "EEC-4 was much better," the Mechanic
continued,

gazing wistfully into the distance, as though thinking back to his
first `57 Chevy. "Now there was an engine computer. Sixteen-bit CPU,
fuel injection, timing, spark advance... Boy, that EEC-4 could do
anything!"  "I should hope so," I responded. "Intel designed its CPU
just for engine control. Later they repackaged it called it the 8096.
Still sells pretty well, too.", Common ground at last!

"Yeah, it was EEC-4 that really sold me on Intel," the Mechanic
continued. "Made me scrap my AT motherboard and put in a genuine Intel
386 version.  Tried a turbo card first, but it just couldn't hack it."
(Note to Intel marketing strategists: you might as well scrap your
Business Week ads: the real grass-roots buyers read Road and Track. How
about a promo with a monster truck crushing a row of Motorola
processors, with the catch-line, "The Computer Inside"?)

TWENTY QUESTIONS

"Say, you know anything about the 387?"  "Sure," I answered,
confidently. I'd written several articles and two manuals on
386-family products. Data formats, FPU instructions, I knew it all, I
thought.  "What's the difference between a 387-2 and a 387-10?  I had
my system's hard disk upgraded, and when it came back from the shop my
spreadsheets wouldn't run.  I think the technician switched
coprocessors on me.  "Sorry," I said. "I never studied the different
steppings, or speeds, or binnings, or whatever."  "How about the
BIOS?" he tried again. "Could new BIOS PROMs make an application stop
running?"  "I've no idea," I replied, again feeling unredeemed "but
frankly, with DOS I wouldn't be surprised by anything that broke if
the BIOS was changed."  "Well, can you at least tell me where you buy
DRAMs, and what's a good price?"  Finally! A question I knew I could
answer! "I get mine at Fry's," I said. "They're down to $49 for mega-
byte-by-nine SIMMs." I started describing the Fry's supermarket chain,
a local curiosity that stocks the valley's best assortment of
software, microchips, and Freon alongside soft drinks, potato chips,
and deodor- ant, but the Master Mechanic wasn't amused.  "That's too
small. My board's already stuffed with one-megs. I need four-meg SIMMs
now."  Strike three. Now it was my turn to be incredulous.  "What do
you do with your PC, anyway?" I asked. One-meg SIMMs had always been
enough for me.  "Oh, PROM burning, data acquisition, DSP, that kinda
stuff. Just got a new 16-bit A/D and D/A add-in board for analog work.
Use it to check out connector voltages, to see if the engine
electronics is working. Hey!  Wanna see my new HP oscilloscope?" he
offered. "Four traces, 100-MHz . I declined. I'd thought car mechan-
ics only used scopes to check ignition timing.  "I'm thinking of
getting a logic analyzer," the Mechanic continued. "You build
computers, you must now something about logic analyzers. What kind
should I get?" (I *swear* I'm not making this up.)  "Logic analyzers?"
I said, counting the years since I'd last touched a logic analyzer.
"Yeah, sure, logic analyzers are good..."

The conversation had crossed into the surreal. Suddenly it dawned on
me why these guys were working on a weekend. "You know," I said, "back
when I was working on EEC-3, my boss said I should keep a copy of
the program listings for my records. He predicted someday there'd be
an aftermarket for high-performance PROMs that could hop-up the engine
by overriding the standard emissions controls and fuel-efficiency
algorithms. Do you think that'll happen?"  "Already has," the Master
Mechanic replied with a wink. "Sold through the mail, mostly. They'd
be illegal, of course, if they failed state emissions standards."  Of
course. And just imagine how difficult it must be to reverse engineer
an undocumented engine computer.  You'd need a PROM burner, a
data-acquisition system, and a good scope, for starters. And maybe a
logic analyzer... But by then my car was ready, and I had an
already-in-progress wedding reception to join. I can only guess the

There's probably a slew of morals lurking in this story, about not
prejudging technical competence based on appearance, and the hazards
of trying to impress strangers. Pride doth goeth before a fall.  But
what struck me most was how these computer-proficient grease monkeys
seemed to come straight from today's science-fiction. Cyberpunk novels
like John Brunner's Shock wave Rider and William Gibson's Neuromancer
often pit computer hackers against a repressive future establishment.
Their mastery of technical arcana lets them navigate the interstices
of cyberspace, hide from authority, and escape domination. I thought
especially of Terry Gilliam's bizarre film Brazil, in which a renegade
plumber hacks sewage systems and cooling ducts much the same way
George used a bypass hose to short-circuit my heater core.  At first
it seemed remarkably incongruous to find self-taught computer
engineers fixing cars in a smalltown garage, but in a way it's
inevitable. The basic skills needed to diagnose and repair complex
systems are the same, whether the underlying technology is
gasoline-engine or microprocessor-based. The same kind of personality
that souped-up MGs in the past might naturally enjoy souping-up PCs
today.  As microelectronics pervades society, the range of engineers
who apply the technology will broaden too, as will the range of
engineers who adapt it into new, unintended areas. "Hacking" will
expand beyond the realm of slightly-disheveled stereotypical nerds to
include a much broader cross section of society.

Subj:   Mail on Mayle (pun intended)

&gt;You might enjoy a book by Peter Mayle called "A Year in Provence".  It is
&gt;a wonderful description of a year in the life of an English couple who
&gt;gave up the London rat race to move to the Luberon.  And they renovated
&gt;their house. Strikes a responsive chord for anyone who has been doing any
&gt;house renovations...  It is one of the first things I've laughed out loud
&gt;over in awhile.

Mayle has a sequel, "Toujours Provence", which is also very, very good,
including a chapter or two dealing with the swarms of tourists descending
on his house, each holding a copy of "A Year in Provence"...  (For those
who have already read the first one:  the second does identify the breed of
at least one of Mayle's dogs, but does not give Mayle's wife's name.)

Recently there was a short notice about Mayle in the NY Times.  Apparently,
his books, which are best-sellers in the UK as well as here, have not been
well received by other expatriates in Provence, who resent their eden's
being discovered by the vulgar.

After reading Mayle's books, I looked him up in the Reader's Catalog.  The
only other book of his listed was a children's book on understanding
puberty.  Betcha it's a howl, but it's probably too late to read it now.

library systems.  Would you please bury me in e-mail by sending me every
reference you can think of in science fiction literature (an oxymoron?) to
notepads, wrist-comps, etc.?  Including, for you Star Trek types, uses of
Captain Kirk's notepad (you know, when Yeoman Rand came up to Kirk and had
him fiddle with a plastic box).

I'm using the concepts in briefings for NASA's electronic library and
paperless spacecraft efforts.  After all, we can't take a print shop to the
moon with us, now can we?  FYI, the Shuttle carries 100 lbs. of paper every
flight, part of which is fax paper for updates on procedures.

I'll summarize.

Has the economy gotten THAT bad I wondered?  A whole expo on

whatever?  With those headlines, I just HAD to see what was
inside the brochure.

Disappointingly enough, this was not about how to downsize
your company and lay off more people for less.  It was about
switching your MIS department from proprietary mainframes to
workstations and open client-server networks.  Sigh.  On the
other hand, maybe that means the economy is (will be)
looking up.

3041&gt; |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
3041&gt; They [the "14 heads"] were probably opportunities for "corporate
3041&gt; downsizing employing an involuntary methodology" as the official
3041&gt; announcement about the coming layoffs puts it.

I had only recently realized, in the midst of similarly kidding someone else
about his favorite euphemism for `layoff', that `layoff' itself is being used
as a euphemism!

The word originally meant, and still does in venues such as the Detroit
automotive industry, a kind of suspension from your job with the understanding
that when there is more work you will be brought back on -- and this actually
happens.  Both the laying off and the hiring back are conducted in an orderly
fashion negotiated by [forgive my unavoidable mention] unions, and the workers
laid off receive benefits funded by both company and employee contributions.

My wife (noted North Shore labor leader) points out that many [most?] teacher
layoffs in Massachusetts are conducted under similar but less-developed
provisions negotiated with teachers' unions[1].  In particular, the timeout
period after which the jobs are regarded as permanently lost to the industry
(and so the unemployment becomes permanent) is so much shorter that it
invariably expires before the next cycle of increased hiring begins.

So the term `teacher layoffs' is rendered a euphemism by predictable events!
What you might call de facto euphemistification

[1] These lack the UAW's clout for silly reasons.  Governments outlaw strikes
against governments.  Some "professionals" (if the shoe fits, ...) harbor
illusions about "professionalism".  Etc.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Governments always exempt themselves.  In the first place, if the
        government kills someone, it is almost never treated as a crime.
        They call it war, law enforcement, public health.  Congressmen and
        employees of Congress are exempt from the strict laws against
        conflict of interest (for other government employees) that
        Congress passed.  (Why do they call it conflict of interest?  The
        problem really seems to be confluence of interest.)
