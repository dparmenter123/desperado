I don't know a lot about him, other than that he was a gifted
electrical engineer and developed practical systems for the use of
alternating current. This much I got from the dictionary...

As a small child, I held in awe the Tesla coil in the Griffith
Observatory in Los Angeles.  It seemed to my seven-year-old eyes about
three stories high and it could obviously destroy cities, should its
keepers so ordain.  When it stood dark and silent on one of my many
trips to the Observatory, I was bitterly disappointed.

I also seem to recall that Tesla perpetrated some outrageous
experiments in his later years - for example, the propagation of
electrical power through the air at continent-spanning distances - or
was that Hertz? Somehow mixed up in all of this was some subterranean
laboratory straight out of Frankenstein, complete with caves and
secret passages.  If I haven't made this up out of thin air, it was
related to me in anecdotal form by an electrical engineer with a taste
for the outrageous, so I can hardly vouch for the truth of it.  This
same engineer told me that, as a teenager, he and a pal whipped up a
Tesla coil that had the odd side-effect of causing cyclic power
fluctuations in the neighborhood - half would go bright, the other
half would go dim, and then they would switch.  Finally, according to
the story at least, one of the big oil-insulated condensers (devices
of that scope deserve the majesty of the obsolete term) shorted, the
coil put a 3,000-volt spike out on the power lines, and every light
bulb and switch in the neighborhood was vaporized instantly.

See why I don't trust this guy's veracity?

I'm certain that many of Tesla's admirers will send you impassioned
panegyra extolled Tesla's contribution to science, and placing him far
above Edison in accomplishments, and decrying the American public's
ignorance and neglect of his genius.  I'll spare you all of that, but
will point out that this guy did more than just about anyone realizes.
 He invented the AC electric motor, the tuned radio circuit (there's
one in every radio...), arc lighting (look up at the fluorescent
lighting in the building, and thank Nick), an induction motor, a
system of transmitting AC over wires, a high-voltage coil that bears
his name, generators of high-frequency currents, a transformer that
prefigured the flyback transformer that's in every TV set, a kind of
radio communication, and, most spectacularly, a system of transmitting
electric power without wires.  Tesla built an apparatus that sent the
greatest quantity of electricity through the air that man has ever
caused to be sent; even today, scientists can't duplicate his feat. He
built a 12.5 million volt generator...

I'm searching my magazine files for a long article I read on Tesla's
life and accomplishments, and when I find same, will supply copies to
any interested parties.

Turns out that I'm a fanatic Tesla admirer too, I guess.  It's hard
not to appreciate a guy who did so much that is vital to modern radio
and electricity, and it's sad that he didn't -- still doesn't -- get
the recognition he deserves.

Tesla was one of history's great electrical engineers.  He and a
contemporary, Charles Steinmetz, pretty much picked up the field after
Thomas Edison and created the modern industry.  (Both were active from
about the turn of the century up through the 30's or 40's; I'm afraid
I don't remember the dates in detail.)

Tesla developed the Tesla coil in the course of experiments on
wireless power transmission.  At one point, he built a huge one - a
couple of stories high - somewhere on Long Island and powered lights 2
or 3 (?) miles away.  This particular idea of his obviously didn't
work out too well; but others - and I wish I could name some
particular ones - were extremely important.

A biography of Tesla came out about 6 months ago; there was an
interesting review of it in the New York Times book review, which
would be pretty easy to find.  Tesla, outside of his work, was
apparently a real oddball.  His death is an interesting story:  At one
point, he just announced that his life was over, and it was time to
die.  Within a couple of days, he did just that (of heart failure or
some similar condition).

Q: Who was Nicola Tesla?

   (1)  A Yugoslav physicist-turned-electrical-engineer,
   (2)  One of the most un-sung heroes of all things electrical, or
   (3)  A man whose last name is often heard mispronounced like a
         city in Oklahoma.

A: All of the above.

In the days when electricity was making the transition from a
laboratory curiousity to a commodity that somebody could make a buck
off of,  there were two camps waging the battle over whether power
should be distributed in AC or DC form.  Thomas Edison led the fight
for DC.  Tesla, who once worked for Edison, had the foresight to
recognize the disastrous problems of DC distribution, and championed
the cause for AC.

Unfortunately, Edison's successes as a tinkerer not only made him
popular but also led people to believe that he had some scientific
credibility. This, comined with a personal animosity between Edison
and Tesla, made the issue into more than a friendly debate.  Despite
Edison's popularity and his own status as an immigrant, Tesla's
position prevailed (although DC was distributed in private networks
here and there).

Over the years Tesla developed such disdain for Edison that he refused
to share some prize for physics with the man.  I'm not sure, but I
think the prize was the (1922?) Nobel prize.

Although Tesla developed all kinds of useful stuff (like the AC
motor), he is probably most remembered for the Tesla coil.  The Tesla
coil was developed as part of his life-long pursuit to distribute
power through the air rather than through copper.  He proved that it
was possible, no doubt that the lab experiments he did were
spectacular, but the principle was never really practical.  (I built a
Tesla coil when I was young and had nothing better to do.  Judging
from the arc it would throw, I estimated it was cranking out about
200,000 volts: the field would illuminate an unconnected fluorescent
light across a room).

The only existing memorial to this great man that I know of is that a
unit of measurement was named after him.   A magnetic field strength
of one Tesla (abbreviated T) is that required to produce a force of 1
newton on a 1 coulomb charge moving through such a field at a rate of
1 meter/sec.

He was one of my heroes, too, mainly for broadcasting power.  That
recent biograph contends that Tesla never made a prototype until he
knew exactly what it was going to do and why, in contrast to Edison.
As for having a unit named after you, it is entirely true that Tesla's
name belongs beside those of Volta, Ampere, and Ohm.

Subject: Ohm's law

The comment about Ohm's Law said that "...naturally, Ohm's Law cannot
be held true for non-ohmic devices"  (that's not an exact quote, but
close enough).

No kidding.  Ohm's Law is actually derived from Maxwell's Equations, and
is based on a whole lot of simplifying assumptions, one of which is that
the devices in question are linear (that is, voltage varies linearly with
current, as expressed as E = I * R).  If you consider non-linear devices,
then you are violating one of the assumptions, and the derivation is no
longer true.

I can't remember Maxwell's equations, or the derivation, but I do remember
struggling through it on an exam, back in Electromagnetic Fields I.

(Historically, I believe, Ohm's Law came first, and one of the things
Maxwell had to do was prove that Ohm's Law was not violated by his
set of four equations.  And it isn't, if you make the right assumptiosn
about the physical situation you are working with--to make it conform
to the situation in which the measurements leading to Ohm's law were made.)
