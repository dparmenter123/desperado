I heard an electrifying rumor on the radio last night as I was driving along
through the rain. The jock allowed as how they had heard that Steely Dan was
getting back together, and that before we knew it, Walter Becker and Donald
Fagen would be pushing back the edges of the musical envelope for our
dancing pleasure. Has anybody heard anything about this? You must understand
that Steely Dan is, for me, THE band, with nothing else even remotely close,
except maybe Brahms, and you can't git down to Brahms. What have you heard on
the streets? Where on the electronic street can I check out this enchanting
prospect? Thanks, sprots fans.

And speaking of Brahms...

              a poem by Frank Jacobs (from MAD Magazine no. 258, October 1985)

         (with apologies to Ernest Lawrence Thayer)

The meeting at the White House
    Wasn't going well that day;
The budget plan was lost,
    Thus causing ulcers and dismay;
And when Jones failed at the keyboard
    And Kowalski proved a dud,
One could sense some great disaster,
    Like an avalanche or flood.

"Don't panic," said the President,
    "Don't blab it to the press;
"It's true without the budget plan
    "The country's in a mess;
"Two other "aces" failed so far
    "To find just where it is,
"And so I've summoned Casey-
    "With computers he's a whiz"

A gasp was heard as Casey
    Made his entrance on the scene;
'Twas clear that he was just a lad
    No older than sixteen;
And yet despite his lack of years,
    One fact outshone the rest-
As a trouble shooting "hacker"
    His credentials were the best.

He boasted a degree from Yale,
    Plus two from M.I.T.;
His work with "backup", "RAM" and "track"
    Was marvelous to see;
The range of his computer skills
    Was hailed both near and far
From Commodore to IBM,
    From Wang to NCR.

There was ease in Casey's manner
    As he entered his commands;
One could sense some mighty power
    Was contained within his hands
With lightning speed his fingers moved
    To press each crucial key;
"The budget plan exists," he said.
    "It cannot hide from me."

With great persistense Casey toiled,
    And yet, upon the screen,
No buried data came to light
    From in the great machine,
Except for birthday greetings
    To a Congressman in Maine,
Two vetos and a slogan
    From the '84 campaign.

The strain now shows in Casey's eyes;
    He's aged a dozen years;
But then, at last, to joyful shouts,
    The budget plan appears!
And now he lifts his head in pride,
    A smile upon his face;
And now the mood is shattered
    As his elbow hits "ERASE".

Oh, somewhere there are nations
    Where the keenest minds prevail,
Where budgets can be balanced
    And the experts never fail;
And somewhere data's safely stored,
    Preserved beyond a doubt,
But no plan can save the Whit House-
    Klutzy Casey wiped it out.

     The Lost Algorithm
(Music by Sir Arthur Sullivan)

Seated one day at the keyboard
I was weary and ill at ease,
And my fingers wander'd idly
Over the noclick keys

   I know not what I was thinking
   Or what I was dreaming then,
   But I output a string of symbols
   That was far from the ken of men.

It scroll'd up the CRT screen
Like gold overcoming brass,
And trembl'd away into darkness
And deleted itself -- alas!

   It link'd all confused objects
   Into dot E X E form,
   But then when I tried to run it,
   VAX crashed in a mighty storm.

I have sought, but I seek it vainly,
That one lost file divine,
That came from the mind of Minerva
And enter'd into mine!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
It may be that DEC's bright angel
Will compile that file again;
It may be that only in Maynard
Will I dump that great file:

           AMEN

Subj:   The Jokes on Cokes

All this stuff about the varieties of Coke led me to design a new machine
for them that can accomodate all the combinations.

The machine will have a display that contains a menu of icons.  There will
be a mouse that will select the icons which correspond to the
various choices.

The icon for Cherry Coke will be... a cherry.   Admittedly not very inventive,
but after all,  the icons are supposed to be obvious.

The icon for caffeine and no-caffeine will be identical stick figures of
men (oops, not gender-free.  OK, persons).   How can you tell which is
caffeine and which isn't?  Easy, the one representing caffeine will shake.

The icons for diet and non-diet will be a thin stick figure and a not-so-thin
stick figure respectively.

Now how do you represent old Coke and new Coke?  That's easy.   The icon
for old Coke will be a can of Coke.   The icon for new coke will be a can
of Pepsi.

Well, the end of an era for DIGITAL has been reached.  According to the
July 15 Sales Update, the last PDP 11/70 will be shipped no later than
September 30, 1985.

Actually, it's a bit sad to think of this happening (and I'm not just
saying that in jest).  Even sadder are some of the newer people around
DIGITAL saying 'so what?'; 'so what', indeed!  Those of us who have been
around DIGITAL for a few years and around DIGITAL products for a few more
realize just what impact the 11/70 had on DIGITAL, and even on the industry
as a whole.

The 11/70, when it was released about 10 years ago, was far and away one of
the most powerful of the minicomputers available, and actually remained that
way for a number of years.  It was one of the first systems to really make
a mockery of the word 'minicomputer', running at about .9 MIP.  Not only
that, but it had one of the most efficient cache systems ever developed.
Its doubleword pipelined memory system was the forerunner of some of the
stuff that went into the VAX.  The 11/74 version (a quad-processor 11/70
in a tightly-coupled environment) was capable of blowing the doors off of
most VAX systems in the world.

Problems?  It had some, like all systems.  The 11/70 liked to eat floating-
point units, and I don't think any 11/70 ever ran right the first week it
was powered up.  Once the kinks were ironed out of an 11/70 system, though,
it would run forever.

The 11/70 was a truly popular processor.  For years, most of the phone calls
that have been switched automatically (in the USA) have been switched by 11/70
systems at Ma Bell.  A tremendous amount of industrial control is still
performed by 11/70 systems; it's a tribute to the processor that they're still
out there chugging away - and not just because they're paid for, but because
(and I've heard this many times from customers) 'a VAX won't do the job the 70
is doing'.  A measure of the continuing demand for 11/70 processors: try to buy
one from an ad, say, in COMPUTERWORLD a week after the ad comes out - you won't
be able to.  Part of the reason for the immediate acceptance for the 11/70 was
that at last, large applications could be run - ohmigosh, it supported 4mb of
memory (core, at first), had loads of disk space (it supported the huge, fast
RP02 disk), and used only the latest, best terminals (the LA36 and VT52).

My first exposure to the 11/70 came in the mid-70's.  I worked as a RSTS
programmer on a huge system: 11/70, 256kw, FPP, 3 RP06's, and 2 TU10's.
We beat the system to death; often, we couldn't scrape up 10k blocks among
all 3 of the disks.  In 256kw of memory, we ran 35 jobs!  Do *THAT* on
your 11/780!  We thought we were in heaven the day we upgraded the memory
to an absolutely huge 2mb, for the low, low cost of almost $40k.

Well, enough reminiscing.  I hope I haven't bored anybody too badly, but
I felt that the 11/70 passing away was an important enough event that all
DIGITAL folks should know about it, and know what it represents: the end
of an era.

Subject: RE: DESPERADO #1120: Now I'm feelin' so much better

Here are a few answers.  It makes me feel really *old* when I see I can
answer most of them.  The first DEC machine I used was an 11/45, then an
11/40 then an 11/50.  That all started 10 years ago...

&gt; What were the OEM versions of the 11/20 and 11/40 called?

        11/15 and 11/35

&gt; What was the 11/50?   The 11/T55?

        11/50 = 11/45 with MOS memory

        11T55(sic) = 11/45 with 32K Fastbus bipolar memory in a packaged
                     system in 2 cabinets with 2 RK05s. Software included
                     was RSX11M and FORTRAN IV-Plus

&gt; What was CTS-500 based on, and what was the primary programming
&gt; language available?  (Or, at least, this was the reason we bought it.)

        RSTS/E + DMS500 (according to Option Module List) - Don't know any more

&gt; What was the RT11 DIBOL compiler based on?

        The OS/8 DIBOL compiler???

&gt; Are there any 11/74's outside of the RSX lab (in customer's
&gt; possession, I mean).    In fact, are there any left inside DEC?

        Don't Know

&gt; What does IAS stand for?   What does PDS stand for?

        IAS = Interactive Application System
        PDS = Program Development System

&gt; Fill in the question for this one:   The VAX had a PDP11/xx
&gt; designation, I think xx = 90...

        What was originally called a PDP11 but was never sold as one?

Subj:   RE: PDP-11 trivia

   *A*  Here are answers to the questions I know about, plus some
        questions of my own, for your enjoyment.
                                                -john ellis

&gt;&gt;What was OS-11 and what did it become?
&gt;       Was it DOS-11?

   *A*  No, I believe OS-11 became RT-11.
   *A*  RT-11 had more than a passing relationship, by the way, to OS/8.
   *A*  DOS-11 became DOS/BATCH, soon to be overshadowed by RSX-11A, B, and C.
   *A*  Questions for you:
   *A*     In what order did RSX-11A,B,C,D,M,S appear?
   *A*     What (if anything) did the letters A,B,C,D,M,S mean?
   *A*       [Hint: I know of two letters that meant something.]
   *A*     What was the original memory limit in RSX-11M?
   *A*     What limited RSX-11M to that memory ceiling?

&gt;       What were the OEM versions of the 11/20 and 11/40 called?

   *A*  ...the 11/15 and 11/35, respectively...
   *A*  ...likewise, the PDP-11/05 was the  OEM version of the PDP-11/10.
   *A*  By that nomenclature, the PDP-11/45 (flagship of the I/D-space
   *A*  11-processors, and forerunner of the PDP-11/70) should have
   *A*  referred to an OEM machine -- as it did -- the OEM version of
   *A*  the PDP-11/45 went by the same number.

   *A*  By the way, two questions for you:
   *A*   - What was the name of the ruggedized (Norden) version
   *A*     of the PDP-11/20?
   *A*   - My first computer was the well-known "eleven-thirty"
   *A*     -- who made it?

        What was the 11/50?   The 11/T55?

        What was CTS-500 based on, and what was the primary programming
        language available?  (Or, at least, this was the reason we bought it.)

   *A*  CTS-500 was a commercially packaged (PL35 -- "Business Products")
   *A*  RSTS/E system -- primary programming language = BASIC-PLUS.
   *A*  The "CTS" meant "Commercial Timesharing System" -- vs. its smaller
   *A*  "COS" (Commercial Operating System") brethren -- the 500 designation
   *A*  meant PDP-11 based; the 300 designation meant PDP-8 based. Hence
   *A*  COS-300, 350, etc. ran on the PDP-8 (with DIBOL-8), and COS-500
   *A*  ran on the PDP-11 with DOS/BATCH.

        What was the RT11 DIBOL compiler based on?

   *A*  Do you mean, on DIBOL-8?

        What does IAS stand for?   What does PDS stand for?

   *A*  IAS meant "Interactive Application System" I think -- in any
   *A*  case, it was based upon the then-almost-pensioned-out RSX-11D.
   *A*  IAS sought to impose time-sharing round-robination on top of
   *A*  an event-driven real-time monitor (RSX).
   *A*  --&gt; There was an attempt to implement IAS on RSX-11M or M-Plus;
   *A*  big banners in the machine room on ML5-5 proclaimed "MIAS" --
   *A*  an acronym to be pronounced only with due care &amp; consideration.

   *A*  "PDS" stands for "Programmable Data System", a little tiny
   *A*  computer (from IPG -- the Industrial Product Group, I believe),
   *A*  meant for dedicated tasks on the shop floor.

&gt;       Fill in the question for this one:   The VAX had a PDP11/xx
&gt;       designation, I think xx = 90...

Subj:   VAX question

As far as I know, I first saw the VAX designated as the PDP 11/500.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I didn't get involved with VAX until it had the number VAX-11/770. This was
firm enough to be made up into the familiar logo:
                                 VAX-11
                                   770
that we now see as VAX-11/780, with the X and the 77 joined as strokes
of lightning. European product marketing pointed out its resemblance to
the Nazi SS logo, and the designation was swiftly changed to 780.

The following appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph:

 Parts reported missing from Digital plant

        Officials at Digital Corporation, reported $68,386.13 worth of
computer parts missing from  a loading dock on Aug.9, according to Colorado
Springs Police.
        Robert Mills, an employee of the company's security division, told
police that 511 broken tracking heads, which were packaged to be shipped for
repairs, were taken from a loading dock.
        Mills said Tuesday that the company had not determined that the parts

internal accounting problem may account for their disappearance. He said the
fact they are missing was reported to police for insurance reasons, in case
officials determine the parts were stolen.
        Mills told police the heads are very specialized and said he did not
believe there would be any market to sell them anywhere.  The only people that
could use them would be digital engineers, Mills told police.

Subj:   Adding insults

Everybody likes witty insults -- about as much as one hates receiving them.
"Sir," said the original Dr. J, "your wife, under pretext of keeping a
bawdy house, is a receiver of stolen goods." OK, so we'll never get to use
it (or use it and live). Still funny.

Here are some culled from Nancy McPhee, *The Book of Insults*. I recollect
that she was sued for (or at least accused of) plagiarism for this
collection. Apparently, she included some quotes from other collections --
quotes that other compilers had fabricated as traps for plagiarists. Nope,
dunno which ones.

shall buy a piece of the rope as a keepsake.

He played the King as though under momentary apprehension that someone
else was about to play the ace.
                        -- Eugene Field, on Creston Clarke's portrayal of Lear

It was one of thse plays in which all the actors unfortunately enunciated
very clearly.
                        -- Robert Benchley

This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with
great force.
                        -- Dorothy Parker

Englishwomen's shoes look as if they had been made by someone who had often
heard shoes described, but had never seen any.

If I owned Texas and hell, I would rent out Texas and live in hell.

Die, may he: Tiger, catch him; Snake, bite him; Steep hill, fall down on
him; River, flow over him; Wild boar, bite him.
                        -- Ceremonial curse of the Todas of India

May the curse of Mary Malone and her nine blind illegitimate children

find you with a telescope.

May she marry a ghost, and bear him a kitten, and may the High King
of Glory permit her to get the mange.
                        -- James Stephens
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I'd argue about the inclusion of curses in a collection of insults. The insult
makes you feel better, the point of a curse is to make the object feel worse.
And I wish I could show you the whole James Stephens poem that last one
comes from, but my poetry anthologies have been eaten by mice, and I can't
remember the whole thing. But it starts off cheerfully "That lanky hank of a
she in the inn over there/Nearly killed me for asking the loan of a glass
of beer". Ah, they're not writing poems like that any more, bedad.
