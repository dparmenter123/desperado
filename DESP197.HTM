Last Friday, George Bush told TV executives that prevention and
rehabilitation programs are needed to win the war on drugs:  "If we want
to win this war, big busts won't be enough."

Subj:   Editor Emeritus

Somebody asked me about the history of Desperado, and I whipped the
following off. If you're celebrating an anniversary or so, you might
share it with the faithful. Yr buddy, Therry

Subj:   Once upon a time, in a faraway land...

..there was a man named Tom Parmenter, an old FM radio disk jockey, rabble-
rousing radical, former newspaperman turned technical writer for RSX-11. He
had a wide acquaintance among similar folk who had an eye for the odd and a
magnetic attraction for appalling jokes and an insatiable appetite for the
minutiae of computer hackery. This wide acquaintance would send reams of mail
to Tom, and he would append each to the other and then forward to a still
wider acquaintance, who would be moved to send similar gems mined from the
very young and not very widespread enet of the day. At one point, his tidy
mind asserted itself and he began to send out the compendium with a
masthead, graphics, and trenchant comment by himself.

I was for many years a devoted follower of Desperado, contributing frequently
and standing up for it staunchly. I believed in Desperado, as a form of
electronic back fence and a way to cement Digital culture in an ever
widening distribution of digits.

Well, one day I got a message from Tom that said. "Can I come and see you?
I have a surprise for you." This from Tom whom I had met precisely ONCE.
He came to my office and said, "I'm leaving DEC. Got to roam, got to
wander, got to feel the wind in my hair and a pony under my seat. And once
I've left for yonder, would you edit Desperado?" I was, to say the least,
stunned. I accepted with some trepidation, and I pestered hell out of Tom
to find out why he picked *me*, with so many more senior Desperadim to
choose from. And he never would tell me, but I think it was because I
can write, I'm sort of technical, and I'm cultured as a jaybird on a picket
fence. AND I'm Southern born and bred, and could toss off locutions like
"A jaybird on a picket fence".

Well, all went swimmingly for a number of years. I focused on the funny, admit-
ting the hackery every so often. I also got us into terrible trouble from time
to time with ill-judged inclusion of company confidential material. Desperado
gets forwarded all over the world; we figure it has a virtual distribution of
about 4 or 5K. I also focused on trip reports, in the spirit of a marathon
trip report from a charming boy named Per Hamnqvist who traveled around
the world on 30 Altairean dollars a day, and sent frequent trip bulletins
back from DEC offices around the planet. I printed trip reports from Geoff
Stern, hitting bayou country in pursuit of the perfect boudin noir; from
Dave Cope in Kenya, counting flamingos; from Rick Landau, writing
dipsomanically from the wine country in California, and from me, detailing
European trips, winter vacations, and a last, memorable trip to Scotland.

Three things happened to bring an end to my tenure. I started working on a
Version 1.0 product, I got awfully sick after my last trip to Europe, and
Tom came back to Digital, praise be! I expired, gasping, on his doorstep,
over a lunch at the Osaka sushi bar, with a shmesaba nigiri in my chopstick,
and he took back that which was rightly his, and mine only by right of
trusteeship.

Over this icon he now presides, beloved by all. And of course you can
forward that issue or parts thereof. Indiscriminate forwarding has always
been the hallmark of the true Desperado.

Subj:   "Mom, how come our new home telephone number is unlisted?"

[from _Calling All Customers_, the N.E. Telephone bill fodder, Volume III #4]

"Your Own Toll-Free 800 Number?  Maybe Not As Far-Fetched As It Sounds"

When New England Telephone recently offered 800 VALUFLEX (sm) Service for
small businesses, we certainly had no idea that the new toll-free service
would find its way into homes, as well.  But that's just what has happened.

A number of parents have discovered that it's quite economical to purchase
this service for their children away at school and college.

Here's how the service works: for a low installation charge, using your
present lines with your own phone equipment, you can have 800 VALUFLEX
Service installed in your home.  You'll also pay a low monthly service
charge and usage charge.  Your children can phone home from anywhere within
your calling area, anytime, toll-free.  It works just as well for your other
relatives, too.

Subj:   Free Jennifer's Bras

From: "Jennifer B. Kleiman" &lt;JKLEIMAN@eagle.wesleyan.edu&gt;
Subject: Free My Bras!

First, some background:

Last night, I called my father's house to say hi.  He'd already left on a
cruise of the Caribbean- a friend, Sandi, was housesitting. She answered the
phone happily, saying "Jennifer! Babe! Just the person I wanted to talk to!
Your bras are here!"

"What?" I replied.

"Well, last night before your parents left, I was having the weirdest
conversation with your parents!  They said that you'd left your bras here [1],
and that they kept waiting for you to ask about them when you called, and you
never said anything!  And I said, "Of course she's not going to say anything!
What's she going to do, say 'um, dad? did I leave all my bras there?'  What if
she didn't?  She'd be really embarassed!  And she probably figures that her
parents would be nice, and save her the trouble and *TELL HER SHE LEFT HER BRAS
THERE, rather than playing stupid mindgames with her!"

Sandi continued "Well, actually I didn't say the last part, but I thought it!
And right then I said to myself "I hope Jennifer calls, 'cause the first thing
I'm going to say is "Jennifer, you can stop worrying, your bras are here!"

At this point, we both were breaking up laughing for awhile.  When we got over
that, we talked some more.

Sandi said "You know, if they were my parents I'd do something to teach them a
lesson, tell em not to play mindgames with me."

I thought that was a really good idea.  We plotted into the night.....

FJB!

[1] Over winter break, when I went wandering around the East Coast with a
sidetrip to visit my parents in Chicago, I accidentally left 6 bras in Long
Grove, IL (my father's house).
==============================================================================

                             FREE JENNIFER'S BRAS!

On January 4th, 1990, 6 of Jennifer Kleiman's bras were unethically taken
hostage by the residents of Box 4522 RFD, Long Grove, IL 60047.  An anonymous
inside source reports that the bras are receiving treatment that violates the
Lycra Convention, and are being kept in a small, windowless room that barely
qualifies as a box!  They are being held incommunicado- a commando raid on the
base failed to find them, though none of our commandos were hurt.

We're taking action on several fronts- legal action is being complimented with
covert action.  But it's not enough!  How can you help?

   1)  Send a fax of a bra (yours or someone else's) with "FJB" scrawled on it
       to

             1-312-498-1533

   2)  On Sunday, Feb. 11, between 12:00-22:00 EST, call

             1-312-438-8796

       and chant "FJB!" in the answering machine.

The preceding message *is* serious- if you have access to a fax machine, or
feel like calling up my father's answering machine on Sunday, please do!  My
bras and future mental health are at stake!  Feel free to forward this message
to who/what/whereever!      -jennifer!

Here's some more News Quirks, reprinted (without permission) from "Leisure
Weekly," volume 12, number 31 (25 Jan 1990).

-Jeff

Dewey-Decimal Justice
.  The first thing Romania's national library did when Nicolae Ceausescu was
toppled was throw out all books written by the ex-boss and his wife.
Numbering in the hundred, [sic -- JEN] they constituted almost all the
library's holdings.  Asked if anyone had ever come into the library in the 24
years Ceausescu ruled Romania and asked to read anything in the Ceausescu
Collection, director of book acquisitions Spinu Virgil replied, "Never."

Safe Sex Marketing
.  Japanese researchers have invented the singing condom.  They put a
microchip in the base of the condom that works the same as musical greeting
cards, chiming the Beatles' "Love Me Do" at the vital moment.

.  And in this country, Ansell International has introduced a mint-flavored
condom.  The company says it is considering chocolate and cinnamon.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Am I about to say this?  Sure.  One brand of edible condoms is called
"Lickety-dick".
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Better Safe Than Sorry
.  Canadian police discovered two coconuts and a pair of candles near the
Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa just before Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney was scheduled to arrive.  Unable to determine whether the items were
a hoax or simply an unusual set of objects left by accident, the police blew
them up.

Kleaning Up Its Image
.  Klu Klux Klan groups have kicked off a campaign to rid Lakeland, Fla., of
crack deals, called "Krush Krack Kocaine."
.  Elsewhere, Klan leader K.A. Badynski says he moved to Tacoma, Wash.,
because "people still drink Campbell soup from a Thermos during their lunch
hour.  That's the target market of the Klan."
.  Finally, KKK Grand Wizard Thom Robb accused Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System, the group claiming responsibility for bombings that
killed a federal judge and a lawyer, of trying to give the KKK and other
racist organizations a bad name.

Designer Shedding
.  An emerging fashion trend, according to weaver Kim Mileka of Walled Lake,
Mich., is having " a scarf or sweater made from your own dog's hair."

If You're Not Part of the Solution, You're Part of the Problem
.  In Texas, Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Rains unveiled his
10-point plan to reform education.  It contained only nine points.  Rains told
a reporter who noted the discrepancy, "You just pointed your finger and
emphasized the problem we're trying to resolve."

Wrath of Grapes
.  During a Methodist camp meeting in South Carolina, James McGriff slit
Daniel McCain's throat because he mistakenly thought his victim had drugged
his communion wine and laughed at him 10 years ago.

Supreme Loophole
.  An Arizona judge ruled that five auto-theft defendants could present a
defense that their polygamist religion, Church of the Lamb of God, allows
believers to steal property from non-believers.

        without permission, all forwards ruthlessly destroyed, several items

                Smoke Gets in Your Eyes

        From an address by Ellis Milan, president of the Retail
        Tobacco Distributors of America, as reprinted in Smokeshop
        Magazine: "President George Bush often talks of 1,000 points
        of light.  I'd like to think those points of light are coming
        from the glowing ends of cigars, cigarettes, and pipes across
        the country, and symbolize the cornerstone of this nation -
        tobacco."

                Just the Fax, Please

        Under contract with Litton Industries, Inc., of College Park,
        Maryland, the U.S. Air Force is procuring 173 custom-made
        heavy duty fax machines for $32.9 million, plus $40 million
        for support and spare parts.  That works out to more than
        $421,000 per machine.

                Animal-Lovers' Special

        From the Seventh Generation mail-order catalog: "Protect and

        and uses no animal products."

                Who Guards the Guardians?

        In the summer of 1987, The Washington Post recently reported,
        U.S. Customs Service agents broke into an office of the General
        Accounting Office to steal advance copies of a GAO report on
        an investigation of abuses in the Customs Service.

        the economy, industry, R &amp; D, education, and the war on drugs
        and terrorism, and what's being done about it.

                Homeless Chic

        News item from The Boston Globe:  "The security for the fashion
        show tonight will be, well, absolute.  That's because two of
        the items - designed by Boston-based Anthony Ferrara, dressmaker
        to the stars - are worth so much money that the organizers
        are nervous:  One dress is made of eighteen-karat gold mesh
        (price tag $532,000), the other of sterling silver ($100,000).
        The dresses will be the highlight of a fashion show. . . to
        benefit the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless."

                Man's Best Friend

        According to the Humane Society of the United States, the
        Israeli army uses dogs with explosives strapped to their
        backs "to chase guerrillas into tunnels where the explosives
        are detonated by remote control."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The Russian army tried training dogs to blow up tanks in WWII.  The dogs
were trained using Russian tanks.  Came the test in battle, and the dogs
dutifully ran under Russian tanks, as trained.  The Japanese trained
pyromaniac bats to burn California houses in WWII.  Several forest fires
ensued from bats bearing bombs released from subs offshore.  And of
course, the US Navy thinks it's peachy to send bomb-bearing porpoises off
on purpose.  Eviles of war.  They should only kill people, not unoffending
animals.

Subject: Writing on Macs vs PCs

Those of you who teach classes where students have to write essays will be
interested in an article in the January "Academic Computing", "Can the Machine
Maim the Message?" by Marcia Peoples Halio. Halio is Assistant Director in
the Writing Program at the University of Delaware. For some semesters she
taught freshman composition using IBM PCs and then in Spring '87 she taught
a section using the Mac. I quote her reaction to the first batch of essays:
"...never before in twelve years of teaching had I seen such a sloppy bunch
of papers."

The thesis of her article is that the Mac makes for bad writing in a way
that the PC doesn't. Though students can choose which machine they use
in the course, she thinks that they all start out with equal writing skills
(because they all have comparable SATs - is this a good reason?). Yet the
Mac papers are littered with violations of English grammar, have short para-
graphs and short sentences resulting in lack of developed or complex thought,
and are written in the English of the advertising industry (which presumably
aims for the lcd). She confirmed these impressions by running 20 randomly
selected essays from both IBM and Mac sections through a VAX text analysis
program. She also noted a difference in choice of topics: Mac students write
about fast food, dating, the idiot box etc., PC students write about capital
punishment, teenage pregnancy, nuclear war.

Why the differences? Various possibilities are suggested. Students tend to get
sloppy if something is too easy. A command line interface makes you concentrate
and makes you sensitive to a demand for precision. The Mac seems like a toy
while sitting down in front of an IBM means serious business (what will happen
when they all run Windows or PM?). The Mac focuses too much attention on
appearance and too little on content. And so on.

(My own observation about Mac writing is the compulsion some people have
to use "it's" (abbreviates "it is") when they mean "its" (possessive).)

Does anyone have similar experience to Halio's or ideas about explanations?
Is anyone at a school where the writing classes use Macs with full-page dis-
plays?

A final note: Halio doesn't know if the effect wears off, and if it does,
how long it takes.

If Graeme Forbes (info-mac, v8, n24) accurately represents Maria
Peoples Halio's article in "Academic Computing," then she exhibits
some bewildering reasoning.  To claim that poor writing skills are the
fault of the machine because it's too easy to use (the Mac) and NOT
due to the people doing the writing leads to an absurdity when the
line of thought is pursued.  If the IBM PC leads to better writing
because it's harder to use than the Mac, then a manual typewriter
would be better still.  And using paper and pen/pencil would give
still better results.  Gosh, the best writers must carve out their
thoughts on stones using hammers and chisels.  The difficulty of
erasing makes them refine their thoughts before committing them
to the rock.

In that history of pencils book that's getting reviewed lately, featuring
Henry David Thoreau as an industrial spy and hero of emerging American
technology, not one of his usual roles, we can read that the innovation
of integral erasure technology in pencils was heavily resisted on the
grounds that it would encourage errors and carelessness.  I don't doubt
that it does.  God knows electronic mail and notes encourages the worst
sort of drivel, present company excepted.

The pencil book sounds interesting because it presents science as the
handmaiden of engineering rather than the usual other way around.

At any rate, this Big Mac Attack has attracted a lot of attention.
Methodologies are being questioned, a sure sign that the heavy thinkers
are getting exercised

Subj:   A request from singer Christine Lavin

The following request is really from well-known folk singer Christine Lavin;
I'm just the vehicle.  Please give it the widest possible distribution among
those who might have information to share.

First some background.  Christine wrote a song called ``Doris and Edwin:  The
Movie.''  It's the story of Doris, who works ``in the basement, near the
boiler room door'' in ``a building with 37 floors and 4,000 employees.''  She
has an awful crush on Edwin, who ``works in Accounting on the 37th floor.''
As the story ends, we learn that ``this is not your ordinary office...crush''
as Edwin leaps from the 37th floor to escape a devastating fire, landing on
Doris and killing them both.  The song notes in passing that ``the chances of
him landing on her are very slim indeed.''

Someone who said he was a student at MIT presented Christine with a humorous
mathematical analysis of just how slim those chances really are.  Christine
has been passing the analysis around at her concerts, saying that she'd really
like to be able to give due credit to the guy who did it, if only she could
identify him.  I offered to help; she accepted, and sent me a copy of the
analysis, which is entitled ``Edwin's Fall.''  It appears to have been
produced using a TeX- or troff-based text formatter.

Since I want to be able to determine with reasonable assurance that anyone who
steps forward to claim authorship is authentic, I'm not going to post the
entire text of ``Edwin's Fall.''  But here's an excerpt:

     Edwin might not be on the upper floors during the fire.  He could be
     out sick, on an errand, getting a coffee with double cream and three
     sugars in the cafeteria, out with his mistress, kidnapped by aliens
     who want to extract a rare enzyme from his spleen, on vacation, or
     golfing with his boss.  Lets [sic] say that there is a 10% chance
     that he is not there.  (Who says accountants are boring?)

If you wrote ``Edwin's Fall,'' if you know who wrote it, or if you know
someone who might know, please get in touch with me.  Inquiring minds want to
know.

Subj:   The "end of the decade" discussion reminded me of this.

A co-worker of mine was trying to figure out why he was coming up with 152
instead of 153 for the size of I/O space.  He was taking the ending page
number and subtracting the beginning page number to arrive at 152.  To
clear up his confusion, I made the following example:

                                pg #
        +-------------------+
        |      page # 1     | : 1700  (start)           1702
        +-------------------+                         - 1700
        |      page # 2     | : 1701                 --------
        +-------------------+                              2
        |      page # 3     | : 1702  (end)
        +-------------------+

The difference between the start and end is 2 pages.  But, the figure above
illustrates 3 pages!  Sometimes these things can get tricky, that is why
"engineers are always off-by-one."  (don't know who originally quoted this).

Subj:   voter registration changes???

Well, I just did a part of my all-American duty and
registered to vote.  I moved from New Hampshire to
Massachusetts on February 1 and wanted to become a
voting (as well as taxpaying) denizen of my new state.

Went on down to my local town office, walked in and
asked to register to vote.  I was given a form to fill
out and sign.  I asked did they need identification.
Registrar said no, that it was illegal to ask for ID.
Asked did they need proof of address (I'd brought some
mail delived to me at the new address). Registrar
replied no, that my signature on the form was enough.

Well.  I'm pleased it was so easy but I can't avoid
contrasting that experience with nearly three years ago
when I moved to Nude Hamster and registered to vote
there.

In New Hampshire I called Town Hall and asked about
voter registration.  Was told to bring positive picture
ID (a list of acceptable ones followed) and proof of
address (delivered mail was okay).

Once there I showed my passport, showed a recently
delivered bill and filled out the form.  Was then
given a card with an oath of maybe 50 words (with a few
$50 words) printed on it and was told to raise my right
hand and read the oath aloud.

So, in my most orotund radio announcer voice
(stilling the small interior voice urging me to give it
the full Victor Borge treatment with pronounced
punctuation), I read it ALOUD.  With flourishes and
emphasis.  Great fun.  All the while fuming that it
smacked of a literacy test.

I've registered to vote and voted in other states, MA
some years ago, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and
always before had to produce some identification, even
if simply a library card.  Never before New Hampshire
had I to go through the rigamarole encountered there.

In 1981 I registered to vote in a very rural part of
upstate New York.  Had all the usual ID with me.  At
the time I was married and had a (gasp!!) hyphenated
last name.  Made it a double errand and picked up a
license for my dog at the same time.

Went into the town offices -- a trailer parked at the
main intersection of the area.  A card game was in
progress so I had to wait around for a bit, got to read
all the local notices posted in the long hall. Between
hands, the town clerk came over and gave me the forms.
After the next hand she came back to finish the
paperwork.

As I was leaving I head:
"What was it?."
"Oh, some damn feminist Democrat registering to vote
and getting a dog tag. Your deal."
"Male dog?"
"Yep."
"Fixed?"
"Yep."
"Figures. I'll take two."

One election, the results for the town showed one
solitary vote for the democratic candidate. Moved out
in 1984.  Dog died just a week before the move.

        THAT FUNNY BUNCH OF 1990 PREDICTIONS FOR THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The following is that bunch of stuff that many have already seen, but some
may have not.  If you have seen it, there isn't anything else after this
except the li'l xxx, so you can bail out now.

Next ish:

        destruction of electronic items, a symposium
        more thoughts on thorpes
        machine-to-machine communications
        seditious thoughts
        wry observations
        original fooleries
        typo's

You know.

Predictions for 1990

January
Egypt launches a megasuit charging Xerox, Apple, Microsoft, HP and IBM with
copyright infringment, claiming its hieroglyphics constitute the first use
of icons.  IBM is dropped from the suit when documents in its archives
prove that an ancient ancestor of Thomas Watson Sr. purchased the rights
6000 years ago.

Febuary
Rios (the new RT) is introduced running OS/2. "Well" says xxxx, "we said we
were committed to OS/2, and AIX is a little behind schedule.  It will be
ready next quarter"

Oracle execs prepare for the intro of Version 7.0 by hiring a space shuttle,
the rock group "The Who", half a dozen Elvis impersonators, and a batallion
of french chefs, until they realize they forgot to develop a product.

Mips Computer Systems changes their name to MIPS 'R' US.

Robert Morris Jr. is tried for six weeks before a jury of his peers, but the
verdic is delayed when all 12 jurors are discovered logged on to secret
Pentagon computers.

March
Despite continued negotiations with AT&amp;T, the OSF goes ahead with plans to
announce OSF/3, providing in-depth details of the features it will add for
that version, and how the new version relates to the previous one, OSF/2.
It also promises OSF/1 deliveries will begin in 18 months.

Sun finally replies to DEC's volley by promising to double any trade-in DEC
offers to Sun users who buy DECstations, as long as the users buy new Suns;
Dec responds by offering to pay Sun users who switch.

April
Just when it looks like no one is willing to purchase AT&amp;T's Unix Software
Operation, realestate tycoon Donald Trump steps in and buys USO outright.
He changes the name to Trumpix and says the next version - previously known
as SVR4.1 - will be called System T.  A week later the Trumpix Software
Operation (TSO) unveils an embedded accounting program that maintains two
sets of books, complete with "naughty and nice" icons, and promises to port
TCP/IP-ALPS to SystemT for networking with Swiss checking accounts and the
OpenTrumpLook Golden User Interface (GUI).  Licensing fees will be upgraded
to $17 per user for the bundled release "to keep the riffraff away."  The
dollar sign prompt will remain unchanged.

After two months on the market, sales of Lotus's Unix version of 1-2-3
oustrip OS/2 version by two-to-one.  IBM says OS/2 wasn't designed for mere
spreadsheets, but won't comment on what OS/2 is particularly good for (look
for more cheap shots later)

May
Sun MicroSystems makes a major announcement, promising its
Intel-architecture workstation users a continued operating system upgrade
path, but one "separate and equal" from the SPARC-based SunOS.  "People
should stop saying we'd like to kill the Intel line", says CEO Scott
Mcnealy.  "In fact, the new Intel OS will be based on the best software we
could find anywhere -- version 6"

Steve Jobs rolls out the follow-on version of the NeXT computer, with color
and X windows, promising to only sell to corporate users who have graduated
from college.

IBM says it is tired of its reputation for pre-announcing products, and
intends to take action to turn it around.  Details next year.

June
RISC becomes passe' overnight with the introduction of the NISC (No
Instruction Set Computer). NISC is hailed as the logical progression of
computing architecture from many instructions to just a few to none at all
-- it just runs off your data.  In fact, NISC resolves the software-development
bottleneck problem in a single stroke, because it comes with a wealth of
applications: it runs every vaporware product known to man.

NeXT announces that it will now make its computers available to people who
have at least been to college.

July
The Pulitzer Prize committee announces a new computer manuals category for
1990.  Not only are there no winners, but several companies are sent copies
of "Begining English as a Second Language"

Portable computer makers continue the "smaller is better " philosophy.
Toshiba is the first to answer user complaints by adding a feature to its
latest models that whistles when you clap your hands.

August
Local Teamsters officials attempt to unionize booth workers at major Unix
trade shows.  "When we heard that marketing departments of major
corporations was referring to us as 'boothbabes,' that was the last straw,"
Local 1748 president Vanna White says.  "We are not being hired to just
look pretty and attract overpaid executives to a booth.  We are
professionals skilled in the brochure-distribution and buisness-card
collection craft and it's damn time people realized it."

NeXT says that anyone who has ever applied to a college is now eligible to
buy its computers.

September
Scott McNealy stuns Sun Microsystems' board with his sudden resignation and
the sale of all his stock.  The panic-stricken board, looking for charisma
equal to McNealy's, obtains a reprieve for jailed former PTL president Jim
Bakker and appoints him CEO.  His wife Tammy Faye becomes head of PR and
begins issuing 'HyperText' releases.

McNealy, meanwhile, uses the procedes from his sale to buy Denmark, where
residents are forced to wear a T-shirt with a cheesy drawing of a sunset
and the words "Welcome to the New Country" .

Wang Labs, having boarded the Unix bandwagon way too late and getting
desperate after four consecutive losing quarters, releases Wang's Own Salad
Dressing.  "We know our installed base is our biggest asset, so all we have
to do is come up with more products we can market to that base," says an
insider, in describing the company's new strategy.  Wang's Own is a hit,
and accounts for 30 percent of revenues by the end of the year.

October
In a suprise move, IBM abandons mainframe manufacturing in order to
concentrate on the PS/2 line.  "it's about the surest commitment we could
make to PS/2" says CEO John Akers.  "We believe a network of PS/2s can
work, we're prepared to use it in-house, and we expect our customers to do
the same.  It's not as if they have much of a choice anymore."
Computer Land officials say they're flooded with purchase orders from
Fortune-listed companies.  "It's about the best thing that could have
happend to us," they say.  As for an OS,  "We'll give everyone what they
want, as long as'ts AIX or Presentation Manager, Akers says.

NeXT announces it's computers can now be purchased by anyone who can prove
they've seen an episode of the "Paper Chase".

November
Bill Gates pulls out the last stop in support of OS/2: he threatens to hold
his breath until large users accept the operating system.

Comdex/Fall '90 renames itself the Woodstock Nation and secedes from the US.
The ghost of Jimi Hendrix walks the floor, reconfiguring operating systems
with his teeth. (Hell, I don't understand it either (editorial comment)).

December
HP designs the world's smallest, most powerful multiprocessor machine, but
is devasted when an engineer takes the only working prototype home and
loses it between the cushions of his couch.  Weeks later, it gets sucked up
by a vacuum cleaner.

Following the untimely demise of NeXT, Steve Jobs starts yet another
company, called oNeMoReTiMe, and a new computer dubbed the wHatnEXt.  Job's
new machine will combine exciting new technologies such as 3-D mail and
WTRM (Write Twice, Read Many) optical drives.  Initial sales will be
restricted to the elementry school market, where Jobs says, "All the really
interesting applications are developed these days"
