Subj:   Part II.

tom.

    i've been terribly busy since the end of my trip. you know, a long time
away from a terminal gives you so much itch .. so when i made my last stop on
my trip, in new york, i visited one of my old workmates. before i could count
to 3 i was writing code for his project, on my vacation. meanwhile seeing
weird things in new york and writing code, i started to write part II of my
trip. however, i never got time to send it off, because once i got back home
to stockholm i only had time to say hello to my friends before i relocated to
valbonne [etc/france]. yepp, it's true, i'm no longer the northernmost desperado
(for a while).

    but, now i have taken myself some spare time to finish this. so, here we
go again with more thoughts from my trip ---

    my previous mail ended by me getting into hong kong. this small british
colony turned out to be one of the highlights of my trip ...

    as you may have understood by now, china is divided into several
provinces, almost like there are states in the us. in the south-east there is
a province named guangdong. the most famous city in guangdong is guangzhou
a.k.a. canton. hong kong is also a part of guangdong, although it's land is
being leased by the united kingdom for a period of 99 years. no, the current
goverment of china would never lease land to a foreign country - the contract
was signed in 1898. thus, it will expire in 1997 (13 years from now). 13
years is not a long time [remember how many years since you graduated from
highschool?].

    the current contract will *not* be extended. china will take back the
land as stated in the current contract. this has therefore caused a lot of
confusion among the people in hong kong. what will happen after "the
takeover"? will everybody have to join the communist party? will the chinese
goverment confiscate all foriegn interests and private property? the rumors
sent out by the djungle drum are wild. some of the greater companies have "in
all hush hush" moved out a lot of money from hong kong lately. these
companies still control their interests in hong kong, but all the money has
safely been moved to other countries -- JUST IN CASE ... some other companies
have done the opposite; they are now making big business with mainland china.
one of these companies is .. DEC. somewhat off the topic, DEC China (run from
the hong kong branch office) seems to be doing very well in the big country.
just imagine if SDC had to send out a new version of P/OS to every family in
china ...

    the rumors are, perhaps, too wild. the current negotiations between hong
kong and the united kingdom seems to work well. i believe hong kong will
remain somwhat of a "colony" even after the takeover since a 1/3 of china's
import/export is currently channeled through hong kong. a too extreme
takeover would probably have a very negative effect on the chinese economy.
such may result in a *great* slowdown of the chinese industrialization.
however, i don't belive my own theories, sometimes. i therefore wanted to see
hong kong before the takeover -- JUST IN CASE ...

    this is my second visit to hong kong [i went around the planet two years
ago].

    hong kong is a *must* for travellers in east asia. to start with, if you
hate cheap cameras, nice chinese girls, bowling, night clubs, pubs, chinese
food, fashion clothes and discos you can at least get yourself a big mac and
a cheap air-ticket somewhere else. most of you know how it's like in a
tax-free shop at an air-port. imagine a whole COLONY that is tax free --
you're in hong kong.

    hong kong can be divided into 4 major areas; new territories, kowloon,
hong kong island and "the other islands". the new territories borders to the
chinese part of the guangdong province. the new territories is the largest
land area of hong kong. south of the new territories is kowloon, a.k.a.
kowloon side. about a kilometer south of kowloon (side) is hong kong island,
a.k.a. hong kong side. most of "the other islands" can be reached easily by
ferries from either kowloon side or hong kong side.

    the southernmost district of kowloon is tsim sha tsui, or Tst. this area
is the main drag for tourists. it contains lots of hotels and shopping
arcades. the main street of tst is nathan road, which begins by the shore
facing hong kong side, going north. a few blocks in on nathan road (on the
right side when back turned to hong kong side) is a 16 story building. it is
named chunking mansion. almost every asian traveller knows of this building.
it contains lots of apartments (where you can rent a bed at a chinese family)
and also a lot of cheap youth hostels. the cheapest hostel (on the top floor)
charges around one, yes ONE, us dollar a night. however, i'd rather pay *a
bit* more for a room.

    two years ago, i stayed with a chinese family in chunking  mansion, for
about 4 us dollars a night. this time, i found a new (much better) hostel
located in a perpendicular street to nathan road (around the corner of
chunking mansion). it's located on mody road and is named garden hostel. it
is well hidden. first, turn in on mody road from nathan road. about 30 meter
in, on the left side, is a little doorway in which a guy is keeping a
microscopic photo-store. walk in behind him and up three floors, then turn
right. now, you can't miss it. this place charges about $2.75 a night for a
bed in a unisex a/c dormitory. it does not have hot water, but cold water is
just fine when you are in hong kong. a small cooking place is provided too.
the place is nice and clean and you will probably meet a lot of interesting
people here (at least i did). [what more is, it takes only 10 minutes to walk
to the dec office from it ...]

    once you've found yourself a place to stay, you need some orientation.
walk down to 'star ferry' on kowloon side. there, in a little booth, is the
tourist information. things are free there (a bit unusual for being hong kong
). ask for a map (and other specific questions you have in mind).

    with the map in your hand you can start to explore hong kong. try to get
a subway map. the subway is very convenient and cheap. the subway map is very
very good, because it tells you exactly how to get to a certain point,
including connecting buses and detailed maps over each subway station. in
case you get lost (or it's past the last subway) take a taxi.

    when going by taxi, do not show too much doubt, otherwise you may be
requested to pay the fare in US dollars or something else weird. a taxi will
charge you $20 (HK) extra if you cross the tunnel between hong kong island
and kowloon. this because the tunnel fee is $10 and the cab driver will
always charge you for the fee back to his home station. if you are out and
hitting the streets of central district over night, there are no subs. you
can either take a taxi from central back home .. or you can take a mini bus
to cross the tunnel (will cost you $4 HK) and then a taxi back home (will
cost you about $5 HK). do not let 'the last sub' spoil your evening. in
general, ask locals for help if you get lost. they are very friendly.

    i will not tell you what to see, but here is a short introduction:

            1. for shopping, go to mong kok (some 3 stations north of TST).
               this is the area where the locals buy their stuff. here you have
               little chance to bargain, but despite this, prices are low.
            2. for swiming, either take a ferry to lantau island or go to
               the back-side of hong-kong island. the water may be a bit dirty,
               but it is warm (about 27 degrees (C) when i was there). i've
               heard rumors repulse bay is a bit overcrowded and the water may
               be a bit more dirty than in general. there is a bus from the
               ferry on hong kong side that will take you to the beaches on
               the other side (#6 i think). this bus is something of an
               adventure by itself ...
            3. for night-life, go to central district on hong kong island.
               there are some quite good places there. one disco that i found
               being very good is called club underground (very close to
               a bar named 1997 and another bar named california). they will
               charge you an entrance of about $10 (US) at the disco, but this
               includes two drinks of your choice. i must admit i saw some of
               the prettiest women there ...
            4. for tickets, ask both time-travel (chunking mansion, 16th floor)
               and viking travel (mohans building, 10th (?) floor) before you
               go anywhere else.
            5. there is a nice planetarium at the end of nathan road on kowloon
               side. if you want to watch the 360 degrees film (english version)
               you must reserve tickets in advance (they use VT100s ..)
            6. watch out for the women in wan-shai (the red lantern district)
            7. if you like live D&amp;D, there are some quite spacy shopping
               arcades starting at new world centre (close to sheraton, TST).
               on clear days, you have a very nice view of hong kong island
               from the back-side of new world centre.
            8. for visa to china, go to time travel. bring your passport.
               they'll charge about $10 for it. it takes a few days i think.
            9. send a NICE mail to HGOV01::HGOOPER and try to arrange with a
               terminal (in advance) the day your itch gets very bad.

now, all this is very fun. but, in order to have fun you must not experience
too many bad things. i have a check-list i use when i travel (not with dec):

    rule 1.     never trust anybody.

    rule 2.     never leave money, tickets or passport out of sight. this may
                sound obvious to you. but remember, you do strange things when
                you get tired. get yourself a money belt and carry this with
                you wherever you go.

    rule 3.     try to keep as little as possible in cash. use travellers
                checks. i met a guy, in shanghai, who had been travelling
                around the world. he had all his money in travellers checks.
                but, in burma you get TWICE as much for us dollars in cash
                than for travellers checks. he therefore cashed ALL his checks
                (about $3000). he got ripped of ... and is now working
                illegaly at a quite nice bar in hong kong to get more money
                (he had to go to china in order to get a new 3 month "tourist"
                visa for hong kong). YOU CAN NEVER CLAIM LOSS OF CASH!
    rule 3b.    in many places you will be asked to change money on the street.
                this can sometimes be a good deal. BUT, watch out! make sure
                you know the exchange rate (by asking other travellers) and
                do never change more than $50 at a time AND do NEVER give
                your share BEFORE you have received your share AND COUNTED
                your share. ALSO, make sure you get the money in LOW bills
                since high-value bills can be COUNTERFEITED. if you want to be
                on the safe side, ALWAYS change money in BANKS; NOT in
                these exchange offices, since they can charge a very high
                commision.

    rule 4.     ALWAYS agree on the price BEFORE you pay for something.
                NOBODY is honest out there. also, VERIFY the stuff you are
                buying BEFORE you pay. there is a tendency the seller will
                tell you something like "that's not what we agreed on" when
                you say you didn't get what you thought you were paying for.
    rule 4b.    always try to bargain. ignore frazes like "but i will make
                no profit" or "we never bargain", etc. in most cases this
                is just a trick to suck more money out of you.
    rule 4c.    ALWAYS ask for a receipt, even in hotels. it is not unusual
                you have to pay twice -- once when you check in and once
                when you check out.

    rule 5.     NEVER EVER sign credit card slips in blanco. some places may
                (even in the US) want you to leave a signed slip as a deposit.
                they have NO right to demand this. instead, fill in the
                maximum damage fee before you sign and then TEAR up the
                slip when you pay -- with another slip. for example: when
                you rent flippers in hawaii they may ask you to leave a
                signed in blanco slip as a deposit. this is a real NO NO.
                instead you should ask for the damage fee (perhaps $50) and
                then write down that amount before you sign. finally you should
                tear up this slip when you get back to pay the rent.
    rule 5b.    always request the carbon papers from the credit card slip
                and then tear them up. otherwise you may find unexpected bills
                when you get home.
    rule 5c.    if you are using a "shared" credit card, e.g., you share
                the same card number with another family member, make sure
                that other person will not empty the card while you are out.
                i know the feeling when a bank tells you "you are overdrawn"
                and you are trying to figure out why? in any case, it is not
                a great feeling to be out of money on the other side of the
                planet.

    rule 6.     make sure you are insured (from home). also, read through the
                insurance rules before you decided on a specific insurance.
b               it is stupid to take a chance. better to pay $100 at home
                than $50000 out there.

    rule 7.     make sure you are vaccinated. otherwise you might catch
                something that will stay in your body for the rest of your
                life.

    rule 8.     it can be wise to give a good friend "power of attorney" to
                do unexpected banking bussines of yours when you are
                unreachable for a longer period of time. [such as paying your
                rent with money from your banking account].

    rule 9.     before you leave home, ask for a list of embassies and
                consulates of your country in the area that you are going. it
                can be handy to know where they are located. [it can be worth
                to pay them a visit -- you might even be invited to a party of
                theirs].

after hong kong i flew to hawaii, via manila. if you like, i'll write some
about hawaii too.

if any reader out there have questions, feel free to drop me a line to my
personal account (LEROUF::HAMNQVIST).

p.s.    i'm currently planning a short trip to hong kong and tokyo this summer.
        i MUST get back again .. i've got the fever.

Recently a relative of mine visited Japan on a trip looking for high
volume manufacturing equipment for his company in a non-computer industry.
Attached is a letter he sent to his parents.  They were kind enough to
let me copy it.  I have entitled it Japanese Culture.  I think you will
find it interesting.  I quote "....

                                               2/1/84

Hi Mom &amp; Dad:

     Have first chance to write from Japan!  I am very impressed with
country and people.

     Impressions:

     o  People everywhere, space is at a high premium.

     o  Traffic is always heavey with taxis everywhere.

     o  There is not a dirty spot on anything in Japan, city, streets,
        cars, people, etc.

     o  All people are very polite.  We are not allowed to lift anything.
        Each plant we visit gives us personal gifts.

     o  Japanese customs are very different from USA.  No tips anywhere, no
        crime, everything runs ON TIME exactly!

     o  This is a mans country, woman are in servant type roles in all cases,
        no exceptions.

     o  Japanese food is good.  Service is perfect.

     o  Overall, Japan does everything PERFECT, only top quality is expected.
        Less than #1 in all activities is considered a disgrace unless you
        are trying very hard to be #1.  I have never seen such a lifestyle.

     We are visiting approximately 20 factories on a two week tour in Tokyo,
Osaka, Nagoya, Fuknoka, Niigata, Hiroshima in both North and South Japan.  We
expect to visit Peace Memorial in Hiroshima, located at ground zero!

     All workers in Japan wear company uniforms except the VP's and Presidents.
We are talking to key industrialists, ie., VP's of major Japanese companies
Togona, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Nippon, Denso, etc.  Dinner with them most
evenings, Japanese style, service is undescrible!

     Have ridden bullet train many times, all new, clean, on time at
approximately 200 MPH!!  All cabs are clean, drivers get out to open doors
and handle bags.  Seats are covered with clean, white covers each day.  All
drivers wear white gloves and uniforms pressed to a razor edge!

     Tallest person in country is 4'11".  People in plants all run for ALL
reasons, whole industry is on double walk pace!  Perfection is only
exceptable result.  Our Q.C. Manager asks each factory how they handle
rejected parts and scrap detection.  The young Japanese managers turn to
older managers and ask what a reject is.  The older managers explain that
rejects and scrap are dishonorable results that existed in Japan once upon
a time long ago!  We have asked many assembly workers why and how they
respectfully reply that is only way to be #1 and is honorable to do!!...
By the way, that's when you can find a production worker, most factories
we have visited are automated fully, I mean NO PEOPLE.  The receptionist is
a computerized robot!!

     Materials for production are delivered to automated factories, unloaded
automatically, and plant makes products in the dark around the clock...NO
PEOPLE except for planned maintenance...we're looking at the 21st Century!!

    In short, if the USA doesn't wake up and start automating, and moving
double time all day, everyday on the job, Japan's industry will drive us
into the stone age economically!

    We asked what Japanese companies did with all displaced workers when they
automated?  They answered that they increased sales and service to sell
products and net-added people overall!  Japan leads the world in most products
now.

    No one talks of WWII, ever.  All talk is about productivity, efficiency
and being #1 in all!...Lord help the USA economy.

                                                Love,
                                                Jim

                              SINGSONG

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Three gangs of carolers descended on the Mill just before Christmas.
They were from the Maynard (conducted by rival electronic scribbler
David C. Larrick, REGINA::DCL), Hudson (conducted Will Sherwood, founding
conductor of the DECarolers), and  Spit Brook (conducted by Desperado
Joanne Warburton, of SIVA::).

First, all three groups serenaded the Thompson street entrance in
unison and moved into the cafeteria for a half-dozen songs.  The
singers were enthralled with the wonderful acoustics of the cafeteria.
These groups, by the way had never sung together before this day, and
they sang beautifully.  The repetoire was all the usual carols plus
some rather icky adaptations mentioning various DEC products.  Next
Christmas, someone send me the words and I will reprint them, but not
now.

Because the Mill does not allow such large granules as triple
combination choirs to pass through, they broke up into their natural
groupings for the trip to Ken Olsen's office.  I ended up with the job
of guiding the Spit Brook Carolers, popularly known as the SpitTunes,
while Sherwood and Larrick were to lead their choristers through
alternate paths.

Our group stopped and sang wherever there were a few people or
wherever the acoustics were particularly good.  At the top of five
flights of stairs between buildings 12 and 3 rose the cry: 'What will
we sing for the stairwell?'

At one point, the Spitunes crossed paths with one of the other groups,
Larrick's I think.  Each choir held tight and sang its song through to
the end without breaking melody, harmony, or rhythm.  I stood in the
middle and was treated to some delightful dissonances rather
reminiscent of that Charles Ives composition in which the two town
bands run into each other and respond in the same way.

All three groups, with a minimum of planning, arrived at B.J.'s office
within two choruses of 'Silent Night' of each other.  Who says the DEC
way doesn't work?  Three products, no planning, and a triumphant
finish.  Sounds about average.

So off we went to Ken's office - next to B.J.'s - to finish off the
tour. After the first song, Ken said, 'If I could get the whole
company to work together like that, we'd be in great shape.'  Then
they sang lots more songs for Ken's staff - maybe a few too many,
choristers? - and went off to an adjacent conference room full of cold
cuts and sang everything all over again.  It was basically pretty
wonderful.  Let's keep the spirit of Christmas bright all year round,
okay?

Musical notes:  I particularly enjoyed standing while the chorus
walked by Indian file, hearing all the parts independently, one voice
at a time.  Also cute was the relay conductor mode where the director
conducted and widely spaced assistants repeated the instructions for
those who could not see the conductor.

Subj:   RE: #1103: Tongue in cheek

About the smoking policy - nothing "tongue in cheek" about it. The
"final draft" is abysmal. And that's the BEST I can say for it.

My first "KO" letter (I've been here 5 years) was "answered" a couple

naive to think that KO has the time to read every bitch from whatever subset of
70K+ employees that write him on occasion, yet it is disheartening to actually
find out...

The Mucky-muck was kind enough to let me know that "my comments had been
forwarded on to the appropriate [unnamed] person". Since that paper memo, I
have heard thru the electronic grapevine what is thought of us that see the
"smoking" policy as the meaningless rubbish it is. We're noise. Not even white
Gaussian. I'm told that "the management committee will be advised of a small
number of dissenting opinions".

Keep those cards and letter coming.

Again, my proposed policy:  No smoking in conference rooms, period.
Meeting breaks every two hours.  Some accommodation given to smokers
and nonsmokers in office assignments, even if it's only fans.
Everybody be nice.  No hounding of smokers.

This was too good not to pass along.

- - - - - - - Begin message from: Dick Dunn &lt;rcd@opus.uucp&gt;
Return-Path: &lt;info-unix-request@BRL-TGR.ARPA&gt;
Newsgroups: net.unix

&gt; "... once the tape is done, you can run a standard IBM utility
&gt;  like IEBGENER to print it on a high speed printer."
&gt;
&gt; And they say Unix command names are obscure...

Not half, they aren't!  If you think the description above is cryptic,
realize that it's only a glimpse into a bizarre universe . . .

IEBGENER is the utility you use to copy things.  Don't be confused by the
fact that there is an IEBCOPY, which does something else entirely.  And to
delete files, you use IEFBR14.  This wonderfully mnemonic name is derived
from a magic IBM prefix (IEF) and a branch instruction (Branch Register 14)
which is effectively a do-nothing program, since register 14 is the
standard place for the "return address" of a main program.  Huh?  Delete a
file...oh yeah, we were talking about that...well, you delete files as a
side-effect of running a program, so IEFBR14 gives you a harmless program
which can be run for its side effect.

[Interesting side-side issue:  You may have heard the quip that "Every
program has at least one bug and can be shortened by at least one
instruction"--from which, by induction, one can deduce that every program
can be reduced to one instruction which doesn't work.  IEFBR14, if written
as the obvious, single-instruction program "  BR 14", does NOT work.
Reason:  It fails to set a proper value for its return code, which means
that it may fail mysteriously.  An entertaining rumor has it that this bug
actually existed in IEFBR14 once.  But don't get too cocky--the same bug
also exists in the UNIX world, since many C programs terminate by falling
out the bottom of the main program and most C startup routines simply take
whatever garbage return value this produces as the exit status of the
program.]

Along with the story there was a photo captioned something like "C.Itoh

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to get this note started up again ...

Bill Keating sent out another memo this week (dated 3-Dec-1984) that says:

    By year end, I will initiate a process whereby our group will select
    a [preferred development] Language. We will then present our
    recommendations and our rationale to the DEC S/W Community.

He goes on to say:

    As the first step in the process, I will outline the goals as I see
    them for the new development language:

    1. Machine Architecture independence.

    2. Reasonable OS independence.

    3. Reasonable (within 10% of Bliss for Systems Software) efficiency.

    4. Positive Life Cycle effects on our programming effectiveness.

    5. Full required functionality (now, or within 1 year).

    6. Full participation in our emerging programming environment.

    7. Near Term, within 1 year, availability.

He goes on to say (as 'other thoughts'):

    1. Development Language may superset (subset) existing Language
       Products.  This superset (subset) may never be a product. [huh?]

    2. A real win, for our strategy, would be an automatic BLISS to New
       Development Language Translator or Conversion Assistant.

The rest of the memo says essentially that Bliss will no longer be the
preferred development language, and that any new projects that start up
after a new language is selected must either use the new language or
justify why they did not use it.

In considering all the languages we have as candidates, the only ones I
see being seriously considered are Ada, C, and Pascal. Of these, I would
select Ada.

Subj:   RE: #1103: Tongue in cheek

Tom,
I also do not agree with the tone and severity of Bel Cross' memo. I must,
however, take strong exception to one of the letters in the last Desperado.
I'm referring to the letter from "NEMO::PASQUIN", wherein the writer
anonymously launched (in part) a personal attack on Bel Cross.
I feel it's inappropriate to use Desperado as a forum for personal attacks,
*especially* (but not only) when the attacker hides behind a cloak of
anonymity. In a public forum (and within DEC, at least in my neck of the woods,
Desperado is widely enough distributed to be considered "public"),
such personal attacks serve no constructive purpose, but merely demean the
attacker and, sadly, the forum.

                           Hoping *this* isn't the last Desperado,
                           Brian Adler

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, it *was* a bit personal, and I thought a lot about it.  But, it
was funny, and it showed how angry this sort of thing makes people.
There really is no hiding behind anonymity because *my* name is on
everything I send out.  And I'd also have to say that everyone I send
Desperado to has asked to get it and I consider Desperado to be a
communication among 520-some friends.

(On RSX-11M systems, by the way, you can make up the 'From:' name.  I
don't think any other system allows that.)

Just a thought on the true meaning of DIS.  From "The American College
Dictionary".

Dis,
    n. Rom. Myth. 1. the god of the lower world, Pluto. 2. the
    infernal world.

dis-,
    a prefix of Latin origin, meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly,"
    or having a privative, negative, or reversing force (see de- and un-), used
    freely, esp. as a disability, disaffirm, disbar, disbelief, discontent, dis-
    entangle, dishearten, disinfect, dislike, disown, disrelish.

Desperado and the like, was reprinted in Digital This Week a couple of
weeks ago and also appeared on the Personnel Department bulletin board
down the hall from my office.  Someone scrawled 'This is bullsh*t' on
the memo and it disappeared.  And, one of my anonymous correspondents

Subj:   The Last Desperado

TOM, if you 'print' this, please 'NEMO' it.

All names have been removed from the following to protect.. (me mainly)

re: "The Last Desperado"

The following message was distributed by our telecomms manager to all
DECmail users at this site. I draw your attention to paragraph 4.

IS THERE a "company policy" ???

I fully support the security aspects of the memo of course but para. 4
indicates that Desperado and others of that ilk are not only against
this so called "company policy" but are against the "best interests
of the company". An opinion which we desperadii vehemently disagree
with.

I'd like to hear from any desperadii who can confirm one way or the
other the existance of this "company policy".

&gt;&gt; When working in a computer intensive environment, it is sometimes easy
&gt;&gt; to become casual about following the company's security procedures.
&gt;&gt; It is important to be aware of the need for secure computer systems,
&gt;&gt; and to make sure that you are treating all proprietary information
&gt;&gt; securely.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Make a conscious effort to get into the habit of logging out of the
&gt;&gt; system every time you leave your office, even though you may think
&gt;&gt; you'll only be gone for a minute or two, and, be sure that your
&gt;&gt; terminal screen is blank so that no information is inadvertently
&gt;&gt; disclosed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Change your password often.  Passwords should be a minimum of six
&gt;&gt; characters long.  If you are not sure you will remember it, make the
&gt;&gt; password non-meaningful and pronounceable.  Passwords should never be
&gt;&gt; written down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When sending electronic mail :
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     1. Make sure that your message address information is correct,
&gt;&gt;        so that your message doesn't end up in the mailbox of the
&gt;&gt;        wrong recipient.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     2. Check all distribution lists that you have on the system
&gt;&gt;        periodically, making sure that all list member names and
&gt;&gt;        addresses are kept up-to-date.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     3. Good business judgement requires care in the writing and
&gt;&gt;        distribution of written messages via any media.  When you
&gt;&gt;        write a memo intending to cause the conduct of a course of
&gt;&gt;        action, or you express an opinion about a product, customer,
&gt;&gt;        market share, or nature of a competitive act, the same memo
&gt;&gt;        read by a third party, perhaps in litigation, could
&gt;&gt;        significantly damage Digital.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     4. Ensure that the contents of your message keep the best
&gt;&gt;        interests of the Corporation in mind.  Electronic mail is
&gt;&gt;        for business use only; personal use, "bad joke of the day"
&gt;&gt;        and "chain letter" type messages are against Company policy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Users of a system can either make or break the security of that
&gt;&gt; system.  It takes a team effort to keep Digital's proprietary
&gt;&gt; information inside Digital.
