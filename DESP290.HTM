I don't think I checked in on this, but JPG continues to remark that
he married me because I had a VT52 at home.  Our boss, Joel Moses,
asked me to return the portable TISilent (two oximorons for the price
of one... it was neither portable &lt;by me, at least&gt; nor silent) if he
would buy a VT52 I could use at home.  Didn't take me two seconds to
ponder that offer!  So, I had this VT52 that lived with me.  It lived
with JPG and me once we were married.  I jokingly said to Joel before
Jeff and I were married that maybe, instead of a wedding present, he'd
spring for a 1500 baud (YOW!... but this was 1979, after all) modem
for us... since the VT52 would now be working for TWO of his people.
Indeed, he gave us one.

Jeff still chides me that when we left MIT we had to give up my VT52.
Now I have a MacIvory... and he complains all the time about how it
crashes in the heat, so he can't run Macsyma!  I just tell him to buy
his own PC, then he can have a PC Macsyma....

We both do miss that old cricket-like Chrrrrrrrrrr, though!

By the time the VT52s got off the farm, their bell sounded like a '57
VW Beetle shifting gears with a bad clutch.

Now, the Tektronix 4032 had a bell!  With *tones*!  ``-&gt;plong&lt;- Dinnuh
is suhved.''  Also a cool gray case.

Perhaps the VT100's most outstanding innovative feature was the
keyboard that could rest in your lap when you propped your feet up on
the desk.  *That* was the golden age of human factors....  It was also
nice that you could go to KMart and buy a headphone extension cord if
the keyboard cord wasn't long enough to reach from your terminal to
your lap.

Tom, Thanks for passing on the trip down memory lane. You left
out the most annoying feature of the VT50 - a painful whining noise so
high that mostly women could hear it. I begged for my VT05 back.
The VT100 was a lifesaver.

I never really appreciated just how wonderful the VT100 was until
I left DEC and was forced to use a grotesque Ann Arbor terminal
with a slow phospor guaranteed to induce motion sickness when
scrolling through a long document.

Oh, and another memory that rushes back: there was a rash of head injuries
in the 5-4(?) terminal room when the LA36 came out. You had to lift
the whole case up to change the paper or ribbon. Unfortunately the case
wouldn't stay up. Hence lots of people with cuts and bruises on their
heads as they bent over to minister to their LA36s.

Um, not to contradict anyone who seemed so sure of themselves, but the
ASR-33's we had were the original tty (TeleType) devices.  You've
heard of /dev/tty, right?  That's it.  And it was more like four feet
right, and did ten characters per second using ASCII.  Had an attached
paper tape punch and reader that would punch holes in this oily yellow
paper that would stain anything it came into contact with.

   Lear-Siegler made a "VT100 clone".  Or tried to.  They would always
   be breaking down.  The keys would stick, the keys would
   double-strike, the tubes would burn out.  In short, the "Blue
   Devils" (as they became known) were CR.......well, they weren't
   very good.  And we lined up to use the three VT100s, rather than
   waste our time trying to use the Devils.

A little more perspective: the LSI terminals were called ADM-3A's.
They were a MSI TTL-implemented terminal, and we had the schematic.
That let you do interesting things like add more bits to the display
memory, so you could expand the 6-bit character set to include lower
case, and visible control characters (by disabling the function of the
chips that interpreted the control characters).  We also added an 8th
bit for inverse video.

FYI:    I *still* have my ASR-33 repair manual (can't seem to throw it
        away) and if anyone cares (doubtful) it was a full fledged
        ASCII machine (not BAUDOT) even though the 1963, 1965 and 1967
        models had different ideas of what ASCII was.

        Then there was Steve Klein (also formerly of DEC) who refused to change
        to a VT100 for years because his VT52 version of the game of life would
        have slowed down.

Tom,

It seems that computer media is a very personal thing.  Jon hated paper
tape, I loved it.

I liked it because I trusted it; you could SEE the data!  If you started
to get file file corruption, you could actually see it happening and could
immediately ward it off by applying a neat little perforated sticky-thing.
(I do acknowledge that you found yourself doing this more frequently
than you would prefer.)

Another positive aspect was the positive reinforcement you got from
actually seeing the work that you had done.  This is rather like potty
training a child; it's important to show the child what s/he has done.

Maybe paper tape would be a cure for our ills today.  If folks had to
save their Powerpoint presentations to paper tape, I'll be we wouldn't
see all the banal clip art and gratuitous graphs (pie charts comparing power
supply voltages come to mind).

Best regards,

Daryl

 The five holes in the tape were expressed as five tones for
 transmission by radio.  When I worked at the City News Bureau of
 Chicago, a local wire service, one of our teletypists was an air
 force veteran who could read the radio signal at 110 bps by
 listening to the tones.  All of us, certainly, could read the tape by
 looking at it.  The E was all five holes and you ran off a bunch of
 E's when you wanted to splice the tape.  Our punches didn't make
 chad, they cut only partial holes, so you could splice the tape by
 pressing two tapes together.  I was the rare teletype operator who
 was a two-finger typist, but I made up for it by rewriting the copy
 as I sent it.  We had another teletypist who had worked for the
 railroad, sitting all day in a dim room, watching the TV picture of a
 busy section of track, typing the number and railroad of each car as
 it went by.  He could do the whole nightly radio newscast in three
 minutes, filling a wastebasket with his waiting tape.  I figure his
 finger bps rate was about 500.  It was all the same to him, railroad
 car numbers or lurid murders, he was superb at his job and completely
 uninterested in it.

 I do remember when we got our first 300 bps machine, what a blazer!

 To push this reminiscence even further into the terminal past, one of
 our rewrite men had started his journalism career as a railroad
 telegrapher, moonlighting for the newspapers in the twenties when
 they needed to flash a verdict in Morse from the Criminal Courts
 Building to the city room.

My first experience at Digital, not nearly four hundred years ago, was
in the mailroom as a Telex operator.  These were the days when in order
to send a message over the phone line, you needed to walk to the mailroom
with hardcopy message in hand, fill out a form and give these both to
the Telex operator (me) who then manually typed in the message on an LA150
terminal.  Compared to today, this process was just one step ahead of
sending morse code over the wire in the wild west days.

The LA150 was a paper terminal and used upper case only, as far as I know.
Correcting a type error was as simple as pressing the backspace key.  But,
simple ends there.  After pressing backspace, a backSLASH printed on the
paper along with the last letter typed.  Needing to fix two letters,
meant two backslashes and two letters.  Big groans escaped my mouth when
I discovered a type error halfway back in the message I was typing.
You needed to type in a sequences of control characters to read the
message in its entirity without the messy backslashes, etc.

Two hours and two reams of paper later, and another sequence of control
characters, I was ready to send the message over a modem with a acoustic
coupler.  I do not know how many characters per second these went out on.
After two hours of typing and groaning, it seemed pretty darn fast to me.

We eventually got a VT52 and were able to EDIT/EDT to send out messages.
We thought we were pretty slick until the VT100 came out and we were green
with envy for those folks with the 'fancy stuff'.  You can imagine the
mailroom wasn't first on the list for new equipment.

 The aforementioned City News Bureau owned many miles of copper pipe
 beneath the city streets.  We sent our bulletins by pneumatic tube to
 fall directly in the laps of Chicago's four city editors (and to the
 sites of some 14 other defunct newspapers, had we chosen).  We'd then
 repeat the bulletin via TeleType, five bells (real, actual, jingling
 silvery bells).  Also in the line of electric communication, the
 office was equipped with a fire telegraph.  Fire alarm signals were
 numbers, one ding of *their* bell for each number.  The first alarm
 delivered the box number -- ding-ding ding-ding-ding ding ding-ding
 for 2312 -- all at an unbelievably stately pace, slower than one per
 second.  If the fire was more serious, you got a number from one to
 five, followed by eleven (to indicate the end-of-transmission).  If
 it didn't make 11, it didn't count (although this never happened) and
 it took a full fifteen seconds from the initial rasp of the machine
 -- which also printed crude red marks on thin white paper tape --
 until the final ding before we could confirm the bulletin.  Serious
 fires were, thus 5-11's, reverently referred to in print, however, as
 five-alarm fires.  Alarms from the boxes were called box alarms,
 phone calls were still alarms, which is to say, alarms submitted
 without the clanking and ringing of this apparatus.  There had been a
 terrible school fire several years earlier and the city had placed an
 alarm box in front of every school.

 Four papers in town, you probably can't imagine, but wow it was fun.

If we're going to relive ancient history, let's at least get it
right.  ASR-33 teletypes were ASCII compatible devices, using an 8 bit
code (7 data + parity).  They ran at 110 baud, not 75 baud, and
printed characters (on good days) at 10 cps (one start bit, 8 data, 2
stop bits).  Our correspondant was obviously confusing the model 28
teletype used in the newsroom with his computer terminal.  One would
be hard pressed to find an ASR-33 teletype printing in lower case,
either, given it that it had no lower case characters on its circular
print head.  If anyone has more questions they'd like answered, we
have one in the office next door which is still in working condition.
Why, I'll bet that the new generation doesn't even appreciate why the
ASCII code for rubout is all one's.

Mr. Hall has it wrong about the ASR33.

The -33 teleprinter family (ASR33, KSR33, LT33 [dec variant] runs (ran) at _10_
characters per second, NOT 5.  The -33 series used 7-bit characters+ 1 parity
bit encoded into a eleven-bit serial stream (2 start bits 8 data bits, one stop
bit).

The -32 teleprinter family (ASR32, KSR32) ran at 5.75 character per second,
using 5-bit characters.  [This is the character set known as Baudot].  The
ASR/KSR32 teleprinters may be dead, but Baudot soldiers on, with its LTRS and
FIGS shift-in/shift out characters, on TDDs the world over [Telecommunication
Devices for the Deaf].

And no, I won't call them "text typewriters for the hearing-impaired" or
whatever the PC nonsense name for them is.  My sister is Deaf -- with an
intended capital D -- and the Deaf community has its own culture and sense of
worth, and rejects stupid liberal euphemisms like the above.

Pardon my ranting, but I needed to speak on this one.

                        THE LAST VT TERMINAL?

 From: Jim Bay  01-Sep-1995 1247 &lt;bay@hannah.ENET.dec.com&gt;

   Just to set the record straight...

   In some respects, Digital does still make a "VT" terminal, though the
   rights to the "VT" name may end up going to Sunriver as well.  I know
   because I'm the last person in Digital still working on it.

   In April, Digital released a new terminal called the VT LAN40.  Don't be
   surprised if you haven't heard of it, since it appears to have been a
   victim of stealth marketing.  It was a very exciting project, since it
   was the first real innovation in the low end terminals market for a long
   time.

   It's based on a 80386, DOS and Windows, all in local ROM (no disks), and
   it runs the KEA! 340 emulator.  It's distinctive from any other terminal
   we've made, since it features an Ethernet card and support for TCP/IP
   (telnet), CTERM (DECnet) and LAT, as well as serial multisessions with
   TDSMP, and it can do eight concurrent sessions.

   It looked like it had a bright future, since it featured the ROM on a
   removable cartridge.  The ability to easily reconfigure it made it an
   effective platform for quickly delivering other Windows-based (or
   DOS-based) apps, such as a Netscape-based web-browser.

   In fact, someone somewhere must have felt it had some potential, since it
   wasn't included in the sale to Sunriver.  And technically, it is still
   for sale, though not directly through Digital.  Although terminal sales
   are declining 10% annually, anything to do with networks seems to have a
   bright future.  However, 99% of the resources here are committed to
   another project, and the marketing people are having trouble positioning
   this strange new device.

   So though it won't achieve the notoriety of the VT340, much less the
   VT100, Digital still has a tiny piece of "VT" technology in its arsenal
   of "core competencies".

   And that, as Lowell Thomas would say, is the rest of the story.

I think maddog is a bit confused on the details (understandable, we're all
getting old...).  The ASR 33 Teletype I owned, and the others I used from
time to time, all went at 10 bytes per second and spoke ASCII, not Baudot.
I think there is some confusion here with the Teletype Corporation's fine
earlier models, such as the Model 15, which spoke Baudot and went at 6
characters per second.  I had one of those for awhile too (they were used
for radioteletype work).

The ASR 33 could only print uppercase.  I think it was capable of sending
lowercase somehow, but I've forgotten the details.

Baudot, by the way, does not have two different cases.  5 bits gives you 32
possibilities; these consisted of A-Z, a "Figures shift" character, and
maybe some punctuation.  The digits, more punctuation, and the "letters
shift" character occupied the "shifted" 32 characters.

Which reminds me of another nit: in those slow-speed days, we normally
spoke of "words per minute" rather than "characters per second".  You know,
the way typists were rated.  A word was taken to consist of 5 characters
plus a space.  Thus a 10 CPS 33 ASR was actually referred to as a 100
word-per-minute terminal.

&gt;  The VT52's had the most wonderful bell (ASCII ctrl-G) in the world, a
&gt;  quiet little flutter consisting of eight quick clicks from the
&gt;  keyclicker thing.  (I reproduced the VT52 bell on my Lispm years
&gt;  later, pioneer audio programmer that I am.)

And a wonderful feel to the keyboard! Much of it was designed by
a mad irish drunk, who was assigned as my gold leaf partner
when I was a wet-behind-the ears component engineering newbie in
Albuquerque.

&gt;  Perhaps the strangest VT100 was the VT103, the first personal
&gt;  computer I ever saw, with 32K of memory, a Qbus, and a VLSI-11 chip
&gt;  (the details escape me) We actually ran RSX11M on it, multitasking,
&gt;  timesharing, ironclad, bulletproof, obsolete even then.

Indeed! although life in manufacturing was far from glamourous, one
of the perks, was absconding with one of the latest and greatest of
everything, that was flowing thru the building.

Even when they were 'current stuff' nobody know what the hell to do with
the 103 and its dual tu58 drives peeking out from under the monitor.

The weakness of the VT100 was the monitor board, which once in about
.2 calculated MTBFs, would short a diode, and cause a particular
electrolytic to expel its' rolled up magic insides in a dramatic
burst of smoke.

Yeah, I always thought the VT05s were very attractive sleek little beasts.

They were very sturdy - you could easily climb up on top of one (being
careful not to slip off the sleekly-sloping surface) to get at the A/C
vents in the ceiling, etc.... just try that with anything made later!

Best of all, while they broke reliably at 3 to 6 month intervals, one
good sharp whack just about anywhere and they were good for another 3
to 6 months!

    The VT50s were horrible, all caps, twenty lines, with the
    'F'E'A'T'U'R'E of identifying lowercase letters by preceding them with
    'postrophes.

Mine (I still have it in the basement; DEC "lent it" to me lo these
many years ago as my home dial-in terminal; when I tried to bring it
back after upgrading to the VT52, they refused to take it back: "Ha!
you touched it, you own it"! Years later they did the same thing with
my VT52...) only has 12 lines, I'm pretty sure (the VT05 has 20 lines).

The kinky '-feature was software, not in the terminal (or, at least,
TECO knew to do this).

Then again the VT05 could *originate and transmit* lower case, it just
couldn't display it! That lead to some interesting, um, circumstances!
Wouldda been great fun on Unixii systems, fer sur!

Ah, but the *best* ever terminal DEC almost made was the DAS-21, our
(LCG aka some dozen other TLAs over the years) typesetting editing
terminal based on the VT-71 (PDP-11 typesetting editing terminal)
hardware. It did smooth scrolling *right* - at 9600 baud it was smooth
as silk! And it was sooo much fun to scroll for a while, then ^S it and
feel your eyeball auto-track right off the top of the screen! tee hee.
One of the cute things I made it do was display the cursor as "one logi-
cal character" always, so when displaying ^L for form feed, the cursor
would expand to include both the neato up-arrow character and the "L";
similarly, as the cursor hit a "tab", it would expand to be from one to
eight characters wide. It made for some interesting comments from lookers-
over-the-shoulder as I scrolled through files. It also recognized ^C^C
as a special the-user-is-getting-pissed-I-should-clear-XOFF'ed-state-
and-send-the-^C^C-disirregardless. Plus I had the user-defined keys
which I could use to blast *huge* strings upstream into the servers
to test out 9600-baud input on the host...(I worked in TOPS-10 networks/
comms, among other things).

And I could boot up RT-11 too! (RSX -- bletch!)

Sorry to be nit-picky, but the ASR-33 used 7-bit ASCII (with or without
your choice of parity). Baudot was used by a variety of earlier terminals
including, I believe, the TTY Model 15. I used (and programmed) a variety
of Baudot terminals (and added Baudot support to RSX-11D). The strangest
of these was the home-brew keyboard for Illiac. It seems that the engineers
decided that the 5 bit code should translate directly to binary and they
couldn't rebuild the typebars, so they moved the keys around to get something
that worked. That's why Illiac's Sexadecimal notation ended with KSNJFL.

I don't think any Dec equipment used 5-bit paper tape. The RSX-11D work
was used to support a manufacturing automation contract.

The ASR35 was upper/lower case, and was the keyboard of choice for the
original Unix programmers.

I well remember the beginnings of my home-based computer businesses. In
1978 I was married and living in squalid splendor with my new bride, my
racing bicycle, a Chinese water dragon, a corn snake, a boa constrictor,
and a TDL Xitan computer running CP/M off North Star minifloppies (78 KB
per disk, and we were happy to have them) all in a tiny 1-bedroom
apartment in New York's Chelsea section ($250/month rent, I think we
were paying back then). For hard copy, we had an ASR-33 that sat on a
floor stand. Anyway, I was working on a big project in assembly
language, and on Saturdays, my downstairs neighbor would have these wild
and crazy parties. At about 2 AM, when the party wouldn't quit, that's
when I would start up the printout of the 50-odd pages of listings...

Subject: ASR-33

I hate to do this, but even the best memories, which Jon Hall's
generally is, have their holes.

The Teletype Model ASR-33 stood less than waist high.  It was actually
remarkably similar in size and physical configuration to DEC's LA30,
but that TTY gray was far less attractive.  I worked on '33s until the
company I was working for started selling GE TermiNet 300 terminals.

The '33 did 10 characters per second; its transmission rate was 110
bits per second, and it used 11-bit characters (two stop bits because
one wasn't enough to get the selector reset for the next character).
If you wanted to encode an answerback message, you broke pins off the
answerback drum.

TLAs had indeed been invented.  Three common ones in use at that time
were IBM, DEC, and - surprise - ASR, which stood for Automatic Send and
Receive.  There was also a KSR series, you see - Keyboard Send and
Receive.

The ASR-33 did upper case all of the time.  Its drum had no lowercase
characters on it.  But the limitation wasn't the BAUDOT code.  The '33
understood ASCII - with optional even or odd parity, or mark or space,
in the 8th bit - it just didn't support more than the first 96
characters.  There was a SHIFT key, but there wasn't any shift code to
get from nonshifted to shifted characters - all that 5-bit stuff and
shift character business were relics of earlier Teletype machines like
the ASR-28s that were still in use in radio and TV stations and
newspapers until well into the '70s.  The SHIFT key got you
punctuation, same as it does today.  But the '33 was limited to only 72
characters per line, and its paper looked like big bog rolls.

&gt; The ASR-33 also had a paper tape reader and punch.  Now in another time and
&gt; place I have eulogized over the death of DECtape, and my eulogy has been
&gt; written up in "Digital At Work: Snapshots From the First Thirty-Five Years",
&gt; as well as being highlighted in the computer museum down in Marlboro, and in
&gt; the computer museum in Australia, so I will not belabor the uselessness of
&gt; paper tape here.

Ah, useless, was it?  I remember paper-tape winders, and I remember
booting an entire OPERATING SYSTEM from paper tape.  (Of course, that
was in the days when coding efficiency was something to be striven for,
not laughed at, and our whole 16-bit multitasking real-time operating
system fit in less than 48 kilobytes.)  Fortunately, we had Teletype
BRPE ("burpy") 100-cps paper tape punches and Chalco 650-cps readers,
but I punched out my share of diagnostic programs on an ASR-33
keyboard.

&gt; But I will point out that (in addition to its slowness, noise
&gt; and frustration levels in usage), the little punches from the paper
&gt; tape would inevitably end up in your ham sandwich.

A much better place was in everyone else's hair during the rainstorm
scene at a showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but that wasn't
until '75., and we wasted a lot of chaff before then.

It was kind of a sad day when AT&amp;T bought Teletype.  As clunky and
awful as those old TTYs were, I'm not sure the last-gasp CRT-based-and-
nearly-impossible-to-program Model 40 was an improvement.

My own first encounter with a piece of DEC hardware occurred when we
were qualifying CRTs - the VT50 and the Hazeltine 1400 lost out against
the Lear Siegler ADM-1 because they didn't have anything like as many
features.  I didn't see another piece of DEC stuff until I joined DEC.

Well, maddog's Teletype tale is certainly correct in spirit, although a little
off in fact.

The model 33 handled 8-bit ASCII at 10 characters per second (110 baud at
11 bits per character).  The last popular Teletype to use 5-level Baudot code
(with those quaint FIGS and LTRS shifts) was the model 28.

I assume maddog's dreaded Blue Devil was a Lear-Siegler ADM-3a, which actually
pre-dated the VT-100 (and did not emulate it).  Could be wrong here (as
everywhere).

As for the 'F'E'A'T'U'R'E feature - this was not the doing of the
VT-50, but of the editor you were coercing to use only UPPER CASE
(TECO, maybe?).  And don't forget the VT-50's built-in "toilet-paper"
thermal printer (I never actually saw one that worked).

As the Teletype brochure in front of me says, "Model 33.  No other data
terminal can do so much, yet cost so little."

Subject: '11 chips

In a recent Desperado, you mention the VT103, which you describe as

        perhaps the strangest VT100 ... the first personal computer I
        ever saw, with 32K of memory, a Qbus, and a VLSI-11 chip (the
        details escape me) ..."

I personally think that the VT180 was an even stranger VT100, and also
has a better claim to the title of "personal computer".  But as Arlo
Guthrie says halfway through "Alice's Restaurant", I didn't come here
to talk about that ...

The CPU of the VT103 was the LSI-11 chip set.  VLSI wasn't yet around
back then, at least not for this sort of application, nor had DEC
yet managed to pack even a minimal '11 onto a single chip.

The LSI-11 was a nice basic '11 processor, though, and was used most
successfully in the PDP-11/03, if I'm not mistaken.  (It was also used
in the PDT-11, which set new standards for how low a low-end '11
system could get, but that's yet another story.)  The LSI-11 had an
address space of 32K (words, not bytes, of course), of which 30K could
be occupied by real memory.  That was enough for any reasonable small
computer system back then.

For those who care, the first '11 on a chip was the T-11, which was
pretty much functionally equivalent to the LSI-11.  DEC sold T-11
board products to OEMs, but I don't think that it was ever included in
a PDP-11 system.  The second (and last) '11 on a chip was the J-11,
which was functionally equivalent to the most powerful '11 processors
ever produced.  That gives you an idea of how fast chip technology was
progressing.  During the final years of the '11's long life, all of
DEC's PDP-11 systems were based on the J-11.

Ah, those were the days!

I enjoyed the reminiscence, but the ASR33 was a 10CPS ASCII (uppercase
only) terminal, not Baudot. I used one with a PDP-10 and 110 baud
modem starting in '71. The ASR28 was Baudot, used for newswires,
radioteletype, etc.

Small point, but he started out talking about the ASR-28.  The -33
was a relative speed demon ... 10 characters per second and it
used ASCII.  When you made up those punched paper tapes you always
had to type carriage return, linefeed, rubout, rubout because it
could take up to .4 seconds for the carriage to actually return.
The 'rubout' was a character that we would now call FF.  Since it
had all holes punched you could overpunch any character with it to
"rub it out."  Made the little printing thimble do a little dance,
but didn't actually print anything.

I started out programming in a room full of TTYs, all using the
rolls of canary paper.  It was a problem finding wastebaskets big
enough.  That was another blessing of the VT-100, saved a lot of
canary trees.

Baudot lives today as the means of communication among the deaf.

I beg to differ with both of ye regarding different elements of today's
Desperado.

The ASR33 and KSR33 terminals were 7-level, not 5;  if you count the punches
in a paper-tape frame, you will see 8 holes or unpunched-areas (the eighth
being a parity bit).  "Maddog" is probably thinking of the ASR28, or other
earlier models of Teletype machine which had a long after-life among ham
radio operators interested in teletype transmission.  I can't say I'd seen
any of these myself, but if memory serves the Baudot teletypes were the
defacto standard among hams into the early 80's.  I did at one time own a
KSR33 (the difference between the KSR and ASR being that the latter has the
paper tape reader punch -- oiled, low-speed paper tape).  It was the earliest
symptom of what is either technostalgia or surfing the trailing edge.  The
device has since been donated to another Desperado-fan, apparently with this
same problem, to be the console for a PDP-8.

The VT50 shared some components with the VT52, such as the monitor and
associated circuitry, but the logic was of cheaper design.  The screen could
accommodate 24 lines in both, but the VT50 double-spaced them and provided only
12 lines.  The 'F'L'A'G'G'I'N'G "r bdy" Tom referred to was actually a kindness
provided by one's operating system, if fading memory still serves:  TECO under
TOPS-10 had a setting to perform such flagging on either upper-case or
lower-case letters, for one's convenience.

And here's a little-known fact about the VT05:  while the screen could display
only upper-case, it was capable of mixed case.  Found this out at the same time
I discovered that some forms of Basic (which I think included a PDP-10 subset
of the widely-known RSTS Basic-Plus, concocted at some university) were case-
sensitive in parsing variable names -- in order to provide more variables, they
said...

Jon "Maddog" Hall writes:

&gt; Now for those of you who grew up in the age of workstations, or PCs, and have
&gt; never seen an ASR-33, let me tell you that you are blessed.  It was a beast,
&gt; stood about four foot high (measured from the floor) and basically did 5
&gt; (yes&gt; that was FIVE) characters per second.  Note that I said
&gt; "characters  per second". This was so long ago that we did not even
&gt; have "CPS", as TLAs had not been invented yet.

Some corrections are in order here: ASR _is_ a TLA, for Automatic
Send/Receive.  The same units without the paper tape punch/reader were
known as KSR (Keyboard Send/Receive).  And as I recall the ASR-33
blazed along at 110 baud, compared to the -27's 75 baud, so it was
closer to 10 characters per second.  I don't believe it even needed two
stop bits, unlike the -27's.

Another memory of the way things were way back when (early 1970's) is
that when we got a faster keyboard device (a DecWriter II) to go with
our PDP-8/E.  This was an enormous advance: a complete listing of the
FOCAL interpreter went from eight hours to three.  We still wanted to
use the Teletype as a backup both to the DecWriter and to the "High Speed
Paper Tape" (it _was_ high-speed compared to an ASR-33).  It turned
out that DEC's notion of changing the baud rate on the serial card was
changing components on the card.  We haywired in a switch and a second
crystal so we could go between 110 and 300 baud without using a
soldering iron -- all you had to do was pull out the chassis and flick
the switch.

 What was it called, the VT52P, whatever, it had a roll of thermal
 paper in it, and you could write directly to hard copy, horrible gray
 curly hard copy.  They didn't sell and ended up in DEC training
 centers where they terrified generations of students who'd never had
 a cathode ray tube (another TLA from way back then).

 And, the most amazing thing of all, I am still incredibly young as
