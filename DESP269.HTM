 Capital punishment is making a big comeback.  The state is a ravening
 beast that should not be fed any more lives than absolutely
 necessary.  It's better for some guilty people to get off than for
 the innocent to suffer.  And the "lethal injection" is another false
 intrusion of the medical metaphor into our civic and moral life.

 There is only one form of capital punishment that I could possibly
 support.  The convict is in a room, tied to a chair.  The governor
 enters, puts a pistol behind the convict's ear, and pulls the
 trigger.

 The governor is the executive.  Let him execute, and no other.  In
 those rare cases where a state rubout seems to serve some civic
 purpose, the mob will get its meat and in all the other cases of mere
 pathetic losers, the governor will demur.

Dear Tom--

Some effluviatrivia: Concerning the following, the word "maugre" is used
repeatedly in Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur" (sp?), of which it may be true
that very few people read, but it  _is_  still in print. OTOH, Malory never
uses the -gry form of the word.

From: David Grubbs &lt;dgg@odi.com&gt;

 Merriam-Webster editors found a few more in the massive 13-volume
 "Oxford English Dictionary", but they are so rare that some cannot be
 found in print outside the dictionary itself.  The OED contains
 "mawgry", "magry", and "maugry", which are all obsolete variant
 spellings of "maugre" (an archaic way of saying "in spite of");
 "puggry", which is a variant spelling of the word "puggree" (a light
 scarf worn around a sun helmet); and "iggry", which is an English
 spelling of an Arabic word meaning "to hurry up".

 Maugre all these footnotes, I still have seen no evidence that there
 is a third word in, let's say, the first ten circles of the
 Anglo-American language that ends in -gry.  (Maugre, by the way, is
 pronounced MO-grr.)

 Now, just a little bit more about calendars.

&gt; And, speaking of calendars, is it true or is it not true that
&gt; Cobol|Unix|MS-DOS assume that all years start with 19

Try "cal 03 95" (or "cal 95" for an entire year) on a UNIX system.
Then try "man cal" on a UNIX system :-)

&gt; and that the entire capitalist system will collapse as it suddenly
&gt; finds everything a century older than it's supposed to be?

No, because a date consists of the era name followed by one or two
digits and the word for "year", another one or two digits and the
word for "month", and another two (occasionally one) digits and the
word for "day".  When the previous emperor died, everyone was already
prepared, and employees rushed to change the era name to the new name
as soon as it was announced, and set the year back from 64 to 1.

However, if an emperor ever reigns for more than 98 and whatever
fraction of years (i.e. reaches January 1st of the 100th calendar
year in which the emperor reigns) then we should expect a collapse.

Now go back and try "man date" on a UNIX system :-(

As far as I can tell, this is one particular sickness that Unix does
not appear to be systemically suffering from.  I usually hear the
problem related to mainframe databases or programs that have declared
a year field to be "decimal, with size two digits" to save space.

However, I have heard that the problems with 2000 have already begun,
in the area of credit card expiration dates.

Read-My-Newsgroup: alt.fan.cecil-adams

&gt; Cecil Adams, Charles Panati, and David Feldman appear only in
&gt; printed books so far as I am aware.

=o= Cecil Adams is available online.  I first heard of Unca
Cecil in DEC's truly wonderful ASKENET notesfile.  Years later
folks in alt.folklore.urban were griping about how Cecil's
editor, Ed Zotti, was fishing for info on the Internet.

=o= I started up a newsgroup with a friendlier attitude towards
everyone's favorite omniscient columnist:  alt.fan.cecil-adams.
And lo and behold, Ed Zotti started to post Cecil's columns
there.  The other traffic in the newsgroup is starting to
resemble the notes in ASKENET. :-)

&gt; [I]s it true or is it not true that Cobol|Unix|MS-DOS assume
&gt; that all years start with 19 and that the entire capitalist
&gt; system will collapse as it suddenly finds everything a century
&gt; older than it's supposed to be?

=o= That's exactly the type of question one should ask of Unca
Cecil. :-)  Unix has a robust internal date/time format much as
VMS does.  The real problem is that hundreds of engineers have
written programs that render internal date/time formats into
strings that have two-character year fields.

=o= All these programs will break in five years, unless we stop
everything to fix them.  Either way, the economy will collapse.

Subject: Stan's leap year SPR answer

The version you posted is indeed the original draft, as Stan sent it to me
and as I received it via DMAIL (the Message Router prototype store-and-forward
mail system I ran, before they set up that official abomination, MTS).  It
went out to the customer with only one modification:  SPR Administration
insisted on the removal of the last paragraph (the bit about WWW and atomic
clock options for the VAX), on the grounds that it was a tad too sarcastic.
But it remains probably the only SPR answer to mention the Council of Trent,
and Stan remains the only engineer to have successfully hacked DEC's SPR
mechanism.

From: david mankins &lt;dm@k12-nis-2.bbn.com&gt;

   In 1545, the Council of Trent authorized Pope Gregory XIII  to  reform
   the  calendar  once  more.   Most of the mathematical work was done by
   Father Christopher Clavius, S.J.  The immediate  correction  that  was
   adopted  was  that Thursday, October 4, 1582 was to be the last day of
   the Julian calendar.  The next  day  was  Friday,  with  the  date  of
   October  15.

Not only is UNIX dimly aware of the 21st century, but it is also
acutely aware of the 18th (though perhaps Anglocentric in its view).

The UNIX calendar command, known as ``cal'' to its friends (who spend
the day typing the command name on TTY33s, a physical act requiring
one to be brief or be exhausted), when asked to print out a calendar
for September 1752, replies:

$ cal 9 1752
   September 1752
 S  M Tu  W Th  F  S
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30

Back before Monday holidays, this would be discussed in elementary
school to explain the discrepancy between the celebrated Washington's
birthday (Gregorian), and the date that appears in the text book
(Julian).

(yes, a UNIX Feb. 2000 has a 29.)

 In my earliest days as a reporter I was a relief teletypist at
 the City News Bureau of Chicago working on TTY's, sending line after
 line of semi-digested news facts out to the world using only two
 fingers, so TTY me no TTY's.  There's no excuse for the Unix
 interface after all these years.  Watch this space for my operating
 system reminiscences (under construction, as we now say).

 I remember the thrill when we went from 110 baud to 300.  One of the
 regular teletypists could transcribe text by listening to the five
 tones that the five-hole tape generated, even at that speed.  One of
 our top writers had broken into the news business as a Morse
 telegrapher.

 I'm still wondering about COBOL though.  The UNIX cal commands are
 handy.  I once attempted to write that program in Lisp, but haven't
 finished it yet.

 I've been thinking about the best way to do Desperado on the
 Internet.  Part of the question is where can I find room for the
 archives, currently &gt; 6 meg (PC) of stuff from the old days and 16
 issues from the new days.  I'd like space that is permanent and
 available 7X24, as they say in field service marketing.  And it
 wouldn't stop at 7 meg either, would it?

 With public space in hand, I would recruit a band of hyperizers to do
 some HTML markup of the existing issues, wrap a home-page around it,
 and then open the door to any additional HTML markup.  I've always
 wanted to be hyper.  There are thousands of bumper stickers and
 discussions of this and that that could be tied together.  Obviously,
 I'd also want all the pointers from outside that I could get.

 The desired end result is the insertion of a bit of Desperado
 sourdough starter into the the Internet.  The archives only go back
 to 1982, the stuff from 1978-82 may still be somewhere on a backup
 tape off VAXUUM, but as far as I know those earlier archives became
 part of the cost of DEC's downsizing.  Still, there's a lot of neat
 junk stacked away in there.  Even having so simple a tool as a file
 finder (Windows for grep) makes it fun to poke around.  A good
 rousing communal HTML markup would turn it into a fantastic document.

 If I get any response on this, I'll start a metadesperado mailing
 list for discussion.
