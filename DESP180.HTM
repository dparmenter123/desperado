                                MY DAY IN COURT

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    On a beautiful day last summer I was driving along and heard a crunch
    and looked up and saw some poor sucker flying through the air,
    propelled by a van.  I pulled over.  By that time someone was already
    crossing the street to see how the victim was (I'm so glad someone else
    was), so I went running for a policeman I had seen bird-dogging
    speeders with his radar a few hundred feet up the road.

    I tried yelling "Police!  Police!" but all that would come out of my
    mouth was "Hey!  Copper!" but considering the circumstances I don't
    think he was offended.

    I sat down on the bank of the road to try to save the scene in my mind
    (and to collect my wits) while the cops, ambulances, and firemen with
    their jaws of life dealt with the situation.  After things cleared up
    and the victim was moved, I gave my name as a witness.

    So, I was a witness.  I had seen the actual moment of impact.  My wife
    was a witness.  She had seen the van swerve.  We talked to various
    lawyers and insurance investigators in the interim and last Monday we
    went to the District court in West Newton (walking distance from home)
    to testify in the trial of the van driver for driving to endanger.

    Most of the day in court was occupied with other people's troubles, the
    Monday morning sweepings from the weekend's uproars.  People who
    approve of legal drugs and disapprove of illegal ones will be reassured
    to know that alcohol was the only drug dealt with in court that day.
    Lots of drunk drivers.  Thank goodness they weren't on opium!

    The judge's name was Monte Basbas and his court is known as Monte's
    Flying Circus.  (In a previous existence I covered the criminal courts
    of Cook County for Chicago's fourth-leading daily newspaper, so I've
    seen a lot of trials.)  I know that as a responsible guilt-ridden
    American demi-leftist (Libertarian persuasion) I was supposed to see
    naught but corruption and evil power,  but I didn't find anything much
    wrong with the way Monte flew his circus.

    Defendants were the usual ruck: Unhappily married teens trying to kill
    each other.  Skinny little bluebood junkie girl charming the bailiffs
    and policewomen.  Drunk-driving workmen, drunk-driving computer
    executives, drunk-driving salesmen, no drunk-driving women, Latins with
    no English.  Women with bad husbands.  Terrible.  Sad.  Normal.

    These folks had been busted over the weekend, after 2 AM in almost
    every case and they were there to get continuances until their cases
    were really going to be heard.  Most of them were out on bail.  The
    skinny little bluebood junkie girl was in leg irons.

    There was a convict, very handsome, black, and nattily attired who had
    two guards watching him, but no leg irons.  He was an accomplished
    jailhouse lawyer who complained that he was being tried under "an a/k/a
    name" when he preferred to be tried under another, presumably better
    attached, name. He also told the judge he was appearing "pro se", which
    is lawyer talk for representing himself.  It was a real holiday for him
    and the two prison guards.

    The unhappily married teen wife came in under her own power, sitting
    with her mean and miserable looking family, but she left in leg irons.
    While they were hearing *her* attempted murder complaint against her
    husband that morning, *he* had an attempted murder complaint against her
    that was going to be heard the next day.  They both spoke up for
    themselves.  They looked like a pair of wet rats.  She had gone to the
    cab company where he worked and "he had tried to run her down".  But
    that wasn't it, he said, "I warned her away from the car."  But, she
    said, "He hit me."  He asked the judge, "Ask her who hit who first."
    The judge did.  She said she landed the first blow.  They were both
    bright and articulate and having a miserable time of it.  The judge
    told them to keep out of each other's sight until all the trials were
    over.  She was hauled away.  I saw him later that morning getting ice
    cream with his new girlfriend.

    One poor Mickey the Mope was trying as hard as he could to plead
    guilty, but he kept getting outraged by the injustice of it all and
    yelling about it.  The judge asked if he was pleading guilty.  Yes, he
    was.  "If you do that, do you understand you'll be giving up your Fifth
    Amendment rights?"  That got to him.  "I'm not giving up any rights!"
    The judge said if he was pleading guilty, he was giving up his right
    not to testify so as to incriminate.  "Oh, yeah, I'm giving up that
    up."  The judge finally got around to fining him (basically letting him
    off pretty light) and Mickey the Mope got ripped again because it was
    going to be a week's pay.  "It's highway robbery!"  This to a judge.
    "I get paid $200 a day!"  The judge asked where he was working.  "I'm
    out of work."  The judge mildly responded, "Well then, a week's pay
    isn't so much of a burden, is it?"  No, he said.

    The judge was unfailingly polite to all these losers.  He scrupulously
    explained, over and over, that if they weren't happy with the verdict
    they got from him, they could start fresh with a jury trial in
    Cambridge.  He chased down interpreters for all the Latins and made
    sure the interpreter was getting through.  He double-checked to make
    sure they were getting tried for everything they were supposed to be
    tried for so they wouldn't have some loose charge lying around to bite
    them the next time they got busted for drunk driving.  This took all
    morning.

    So then after lunch came "my" case.  The defendant was an older guy,
    Portuguese, and did not speak no English, at least not in court. He was
    a temporary driver for a nursing home, delivering low-paid employees
    from the slums to an expensive nursing home in the burbs.

    I was the first witness, told my dramatic tale, which did not include
    any clear cause of the accident and sat down.  My wife, who had seen
    nothing but the swerve, turned out to be a much more important witness
    than I was, and for the rest of the trial is was "Mrs. Parmenter this"
    and "Mrs. Parmenter that".

    The crux of the case was that the van had either lost a wheel and then
    swerved into the line of parked cars or had swerved into the line of
    parked cars and knocked the wheel off.  I didn't see it either way, but
    I'm convinced the wheel fell off first.

    There were two expert witnesses, one for each side.

    The police witness was a somewhat legendary Newton character, Tody, a
    tow service operator who has done all the towing for the city for 20
    years.  He was in work clothes and temporarily without his cigar, but
    otherwise six feet of lumpy, politically well-connected, seen-it-all
    towing guy.  (A melancholy aspect, not mentioned in the trial, was that
    Tody's son had been senselessly gunned down a few years ago in a
    teenage car fracas less than two blocks from where this accident
    occurred.)

    Tody, incongruously referred to by his regular name, Mr. Donehy,
    testified a bit about towing the wreck away and how he thought the
    steering arm had broken as a result, not cause, of the accident.  He
    started to tell about going to a junk yard six months after the
    accident to inspect the offending vehicle again, but the defense
    objected that nobody knows what could have happened in that time.

    Then the defense's expert witness started to testify.  He was a smooth
    operation, MIT grad and former engineer for Studebaker-Packard, now
    obviously in the business being an expert witness.  He started to
    testify about examining the offending vehicle in the junk yard six
    months after the accident.

    The prosecutor hopped up to object.  The judge was practically laughing
    in the defense lawyer's face and the trial was more or less over.  The
    Studebaker-Packard guy testified a little about the theory of it all,
    but the defense case was plain blown away by the defense.  "You can't
    have it both ways," said the judge, and the defense lawyer looked like
    he'd been kicked.  The defendant was oblivious and found guilty.

    The judge levied the smallest fine he could $125) and explained, for
    the tenth time that day, that the defendant could have another fresh
    trial if he wanted, practically begging the defendant to appeal, but
    he'd had all he wanted.  He just wanted to pay his fine and disappear.
    I don't think he understood that he'll probably have to do it all over
    again when the lawsuit is heard.

    I was the only one to say anything about the victim of the accident.
    He'd been in the hospital for months after the accident, which occurred
    a year before.

    The defense lawyer called us up the next night and thanked us for being
    good citizens and testifying.  I didn't call him out on his mistake.

    The next time you hear about legal technicalities, it is probably some
    judge doing the best he can with the dubious legal and illegal talent
    appearing before him to wring a little justice out of an endless supply
    of stupid situations.

A Friend (with an Interest in Antiquities) Writes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Mon, 27 Feb 89 07:05 PST
From: Bill Schottstaedt &lt;BIL%CCRMA-F4@SAIL.Stanford.EDU&gt;

I've been reading a book on the "Origins of European Thought"; somewhat
random, but interesting account of the most ancient known sources of
pre-philosophical thought.  Anyway, one of the stories is about a Roman
general named Marcius (admittedly very late antiquity -- the reference is
"Livy xxv 39 16", whatever that means) who was giving an oration to the
troops before a battle.  The troops were amazed to see flames coming from
the top of his head -- they were greatly inspired by this!

There was a similar story about one Servius Tullius whose "head blazed in
the sight of many people" causing onlookers to run for buckets of water,
but the queen said not to quench it and it went out when he fell asleep.
Cicero relates Servius's flame to his (Servius's) remarkable sagacity in
speech and action...  Pliny claims this same Servius was begotten by a
phallus of fire, and Ovid was apparently there too.  I could go on, but...

Subj:   Our commercial flights help "balance" the budget

    Information excerpted from AAA World magazine (March/April 1989):

    "Our Money Isn't Buying Safer Skies," by Susan Gustafson Pikrallidas

    Domestic airline tickets are taxed at 8% and international tickets
    are taxed at a flat rate of $3.  This money goes into a trust fund
    created by Congress in 1970 and is to be used for air traffic
    control systems, airport development, and air safety research.

    It is estimated that during the peak travel season this fund
    collects more than $10 million a day and by January 1990 it should
    contain $6 billion in surplus.

    Ms. Pikrallidas states that Congress and the President refuse to
    spend this money - $6 billion looks good on anyone's ledger,
    especially when we have such a high deficit.  Note that by law, this
    money can not be used for anything except airports and airways.

Quoting:

    "In 1987, Congress tried to end this accountant's sleight-of-hand by
    issuing an ultimatum: either spend 85 percent of the trust fund
    money authorized in fiscal years 1988 and 1989, or cut user taxes in
    half.  Now, with the 1990 deadline fast approaching - and the budget
    still far from balanced - both the Administration and Congress are
    giving serious consideration to rescinding that ultimatum.  'Let's
    keep up bookkeeping-as-usual,' the argument goes, 'just for
    appearance's sake.'

    We [AAA] urge Congress to honor the promise it made to itself and to
    us, America's airline passengers. ... Stop pretending that money
    earmarked for air transportation can be counted against the
    deficit."

And that ain't all:  Steerage tickets subsidize first-class where they get
free drinks, free decks of cards, and marriage proposals from the stews.

Convicted Killer Dies in His Own Electric Chair

COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A convicted murderer who avoided the electric chair
was electrocuted accidentally while sitting on a steel toilet in his
cell, prison officials said.

Michael Anderson Godwin, 28, apparently was trying to fix a pair of
earphones connected to his television set Sunday when he bit into a wire
and was electrocuted in his cell at the Central Correctional
Institution, officials said.

Godwin was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1983.
An earlier verdict that would have sent Godwin to the electric chair had
been overturned on appeal.

Our opening flurry today is from two intrepid Digits, travelling to Japan,
where DEC bought them baths and squid lips.  They're both in the
internationalization racket.  Item 1, Neil Keefe, lived there awhile back,
learned Japanese, got a colored belt in some fighting technique, and met
his wife, who is now, in Waltham, Mass., the east coast's leading exporter
of sea urchins.  Item 2, David Parmenter, is my Number 1 son, permanently
afflicted with wanderlust.  They were in Japan to achieve secret corporate
purposes not revealed here.

Subj:   I eat weird food, therefore I am. (Japan trip report.)

Just back from one month in Japan. First two weeks on DEC business with David
P., young software engineer. David's wife Jenny, and my wife and baby arrive a
week later. Second two weeks vacation. My wife is Japanese, first time back for
her in 9 years.

First week stay with classic bitter expat friend Tom, longtime Kawasaki
resident (yes, it's a city too) who rides the Tokyo trains every day. He finds
his way in and out of Shinjuku station (world's biggest) easily, without
reading a single kanji.

Says everybody riding the Japanese trains looks and acts like they're going to
a funeral. Black school uniforms, conservative suits, navy blue overcoats, a
sea of black hair. Nobody says a word. That's okay, I say, makes the crowding
more tolerable. Try putting this many Americans so close together and see what
happens.

We are best of friends, though mad at each other about his unwillingness to
learn the language. He doesn't have the personality for it, especially to learn
a language that people aren't used to hearing spoken badly. You have to talk
like a two-year old all the time, to reach the distant goal of talking like a
three-year old. He's too proud or shy, so he sits at home and reads books about
Irish, Arabic, and Norwegian. The farther away, the better. He works evenings,
stays home all day, channels his intellectual energy into teaching his 2 1/2
year old daughter everything he knows. Result is a tiny genius, who can recite
and sing every verse of every nursery rhyme and song I ever heard of, in
English and Japanese. Source of great merriment, a funny complement to grumpy
papa.

Fun to grapple with the kanji, like doing a giant cryptoquote. Occasionally,
you can actually figure out what something says. Result of this great effort is
the ability to understand, usually, a painfully trite message. Most of the
advertising on the trains, for example, are for "English Conversation" schools,
wedding halls, and cemetaries (Cheap! Conveniently located near the train
station!). Wife says they are only interesting if you want to read them but
can't. More fun to learn the kanji for the train station names.

Takes a few days to remember how to read menus, what kind of food you can get
where. But it doesn't matter. You takes your chances, that's the fun. Best
places are the "izakaya", usually tiny eating-and-drinking places with
"yakitori" written on big red paper lanterns hanging outside. The smaller the
shop, the better. Izakaya are convivial, a mood not found much in America,
where you cannot relax like this with strangers. Crowded, noisy, and smoky from
broiled skewered meat and god knows what, and of course (gasp) cigarettes,
these are no places for fainthearted vegetarians or anti-smokers.

Entering is daunting, most have never had a foreigner inside. A brief hush of
uncertainty among the denizens. Quick, smile and say something in Japanese!
Doesn't matter what - "Good morning!", then everybody relaxes, and the din
starts back up. The curious may toss a few English words your way. You can try
out your Japanese. You rub elbows with your neighbors, a nice change from the
wide open spaces Americans like to have between themselves and everybody else.
Japanese love to come to America to escape the crush of the mob. Japan in turn
is a nice respite from the relentless isolation of American life.

First night in Ikebukuro, strike up a conversation with the red-faced drinkers
at the next table, wind up ordering "what they had", and get "dojou"  boiled in
egg and bamboo shoots. Very nice, with saki, beer and pickles. Later check the
dictionary, dojou is mudfish, also known as "loach", like fresh-water eel only
considered lower in class.

Second day at work, go to nearby shop for lunch of "unagi", or freshwater eel.
Fillets boiled then roasted in sweet sauce and served in a lacquer box on top
of rice. Delicious tender and rich. Good for your "hormones", they say. What
Popeye would eat if he were Japanese.

An evening in Iidabashi with Avery, a blond haired Nihon-DEC guy of fluent
Japanese and mischievous attitude. A steady stream of jokes and puns in
Japanese. He chides the waiter for slow service, claims the waiter speaks with
an accent, and is not Japanese. This stands the usual idea that foreigners
can't speak the language on its head, to the amusement of the other patrons,
who are also impatient with the service. He orders thinly sliced raw beef,
scallops, and fried cheese (!) to go with our Hiroshima saki and beer.

Next night dinner with Nobuko in Shinjuku. Beer, saki, skewers of everything,
and "ankimo", pati of monkfish liver. Expensive and delicious. Part of the
market research (see below).

Late night dinner of "chanko-nabe" in Osaka, at a Sumo wrestler restaurant.
Wrestlers eat this meal at midday, then take a long nap in order to gain
weight. Mushrooms, cabbage, shrimp, tofu, fish cakes, rice cakes, beef strips,
anything else at hand, tossed into a big central pot. Including sliced
testicles of some farm animal exactly which we never discovered. Delicious,
with lots of beer. We returned to the hotel, took a long nap, and gained
several pounds. David develops gastrointestinal discomfort, but remains
enthusiastic.

Back in Tokyo, go to Kappabashi to buy plastic food, and have dinner in Ueno,
one of the older neighborhoods. Duck into red lantern with David and Jenny.
Saki and beer, menu discussion with next table in baby Japanese, food ordered.
Don't let Jenny know she's eating jellyfish, but she surmises somehow. Feigns
(?) anger at being tricked into eating something slimy. Haw haw we all go, and
pour her some more beer. Attempt to insist that jellyfish is a vegetable.
Skewers of chicken, pork, beef, tiny green peppers, liver - plenty of time to
be a vegetarian after the trip. Dishes of tofu covered in shaved bonito,
pickled plum, quails eggs.

Lunch in wife's hometown. Baby and me, watching Sumo on TV and chewing whole
dried squids. Squid and seven-month old with two teeth, about an even match.
She never looked happier, than with this mouthful of rubbery tentacles.

Later in the week dinner in Nihonbashi with two Japan Steel guys, who used to
work in Harvard square with wife-san. Meal cost about $200 each, worth every
penny since we didn't pay. Separate tatami room, silent expert young waitress
in kimono appearing and vanishing at precise intervals. Course after course of
wonderment. Whole grilled fish, tofu in aspic topped with shaved jellyfish,
tiny whole squid, candied chestnuts, strawberries and cream for dessert.

Twice go to the world's biggest fish market at Tsukiji, on Tokyo's waterfront.
Late the first time, so host (customer of wife's company in Boston) takes us to
nearby famous hole-in-the-wall restaurant to discuss fish business and to eat
unusual sushi (squid and sea urchin stacked on one piece and wrapped in
seaweed, a local shrimp nicknamed "tire" because it looks like tire tracks,
etc.). Seats about 12, at the counter. Clientele is very particular, since
they're fish traders who know from sea urchin and squid, more than anybody.

Returned two days later, at 6 AM, with camera and without baby. Host dons
rubber boots and shows us around the market. I take pictures of some sea urchin
roe selling at %1500 ($12) per small box, other boxes at %8700 ($62) per box.
Sea urchins are paying wife's air fare, so have to take pictures. Difference is
color, shape, consistency. Obvious, right? he says. I squint. Huge head and
tailless tuna being trundled around on forklifts. Buckets of sea cucumbers -
truly vile. Plastic bins of bright red octopii, cooked and raw. Gooey squid of
all sizes - big ones look like dogs pulled inside out. Snapper, blowfish,
fluke, eels, clams, shrimp - breathtaking variety, exuberance and clamor.

Trucks, handtrucks, wheelbarrows, lifts, carts, everybody in rubber boots
except us, all in each other's way yet all somehow moving right along. We
bumble along, sliding on squid remains and fish scales.  Host walks along
casually, somehow not getting killed by the traffic, occasionally stops to let
us catch up. Friend of host tosses a few cooked baby octopii our way. We chew
on the legs while stumbling around between the stalls. Stop for coffee, finish
the legs - it's almost 8 AM by now.

Coffee and octopus, our last Japanese breakfast.

Walking out of Tsukiji notice a bag of dried octopus beaks and lips for sale at
a fish shop - %500 for a small bag. And not a chain restaurant in sight. I know
we are somewhere interesting.

Miscellaneous:
------------------------

Central heating is poorly understood. Anywhere that has central heating (office
buildings, not private homes) is too hot. My room in the Osaka Sheraton, our
only night in an actual hotel, a sterile cube on the 173rd floor, so hot David
gasps, keels over and says it feels like being in Jonestown. Turned "air con"
knob on full blast, to cool the room. Came back room was even hotter. Mgr says
to cool off a room you must turn OFF the "air con" knob, because air con means
"heat" if it's wintertime. So you can't actually cool the room, you can only
disable the heat and cook in the stagnant air.

Nihon-DEC people steaming in their centrally heated office buildings too, in
Ikebukuro and Osaka.

Trains are likewise sweltering. Occasionally some rebellious sort may lean over
and open a window. Because the heat's always on in the trains, because it's
still winter, even if it's 75 degrees outside and the cherry blossoms are in
full bloom.

Japanese taxi drivers wear neckties and white gloves. Seats have white linen
lace covers. Cabs must be professionally cleaned monthly, then certified
spotless. On return to Logan, take an old tank of a cab home. Drivers window
won't shut, she gets soaked. Cab bounces over mammoth pot holes, rattles its
way to our house. First impression on return: America is falling apart. Run out
into back yard and stare at woods to feel better.

Wife and I ponder moving back to Japan some day. American culture grows both
blander and grimmer - burgers and malls, AIDS, drugs and assault rifles. Move
to Japan, we think, for the sake of baby's bilingualness, quick access to
plastic toast and monkfish liver, and the chance for me to start out all over
again as a three-year-old illiterate with a taste for octopus.

Subj:   Japanese Culture to go

Just back from 2 weeks of business and a week of holiday in Japan.  Here are
some ramshackle recollections and impressions of the trip.  My comrade
Keefe-san is preparing a rather encyclopedic survey of the gustatory aspects of
Japan, so I will focus on a couple of my favorites.  I don't think I was quite
prepared for how truly different everything in  Japan was.   Some of the
details here described will doubtless be patently false, but this is how it
seemed to  me at the time.

                        F O O D

If you like (or can learn to like) "weird food" (as we gaijin might describe
it), you have it made in Japan.  You can eat cheaply and delicously, with a
fabulous amount of variety.  Luckily, Jenny (my wife) and I already liked sushi
and sashimi, so we had a moderate head start upon arrival.

Some westerners have an image of Japan being a haven for vegetarianism.  This
seemed to me untrue.  In fact, I think a vegetarian who did not speak the
language quite well would end up picking at his food quite a bit, as they eat
quite a bit of chicken and other meats, though they do not eat very much red
meat at all.

Japanese food is mostly segregated by type.  Sushi is unheard of in a chinese
restaurant, ramen (pronounced ldamen) is not for sale in Japanese restaurants,
and so forth.

There are sushi places almost anywhere, at almost any price.  Think twice
before entering any restaurant that does not have its prices posted.  Sushi is
basically priced by the total number of pieces, and the number of premium
pieces.  I was never sure which of the pieces were premium, or why, but I
suppose one could get the hang of it.  Typically the sushi itself was the meal
possibly accompanied by either Miso soup, or a clear soup with clover in it
(whose name escaped me).  Whenever I tried to as the waiter how a certain item
was named in Japanese, he thought I was asking for more of that item.  You can
even get Sushi at rotating sushi bars, where the sushi rolls past you on a
conveyor belt and you grab the plate with the one you want on it.  You then pay
by the plate.

Red Lanterns might be described as noshing and drinking establishments. One
orders a steady stream of tasty tidbits, and drinks sake and beer in parallel.
(It is by no means gauche to drink sake and beer simultaneously). As a gaijin I
always felt pretty adventurous being in these places as they can be pretty
rowdy, although perfectly safe.  The food here is salty, frequently served on
spits, or in small dishes.  Here are some of the things I think I might have
eaten, and which might have been available:  quail eggs, tongue, slightly
cooked chicken,  fried loach, normal sorts of meats and vegetables, fried
cheese, jelly fish (that was pretty good actually!), oysters with the fat still
on them, ummm I was too drunk to remember the rest...

In the states, we have bars and we have restaurants, but rarely do the two meet
in a satisfactory way.  (unless you are satisfied eating nachos, and nothing
else).  The red lanterns allow you to truly eat drink and be merry.  They are
easily spotted by the paper lanterns hanging outside.  It takes a certain
amount of nerve to enter, but if you do so and manage to strike up a
conversation with the businesmen at the next table you can have a really
good time.

Sake is available at red lanterns, all drinking establishments, sushi
restaurants and certain other places.  Actually it probably is available at
most places that a) serve liquor, and b) serve "Japanese" food.  Sake etiquette
is not too hard to master, the basic rule is to keep your companions' glass
full and they should do the same for you.  When pouring, the other person
should lift their glass.  There is a similar ettiquette for beer.  Sake is
served hot, in small clay or porcelain  bottles.  The glasses are like small
porcelain shot glasses.  Some people find sake an acquired taste.  I acquired
a taste for it immediately.

If you have seen the movie "Tampopo", you know what the food and operation of
about a million japanese restaurants is like.  Great movie by the way.  There
are three kinds of noodles available:  "ramen" (pronounced ldamen), which are
thin;  oodong, which are very thick; soba which are flat and thinnish.  These
restaurants are built for speed, so one doesn't dawdle here. Basically people
eat and run.  In fact a lot of places are built for speed. The way to tell if
this is a good place to hang out is if any customers are  reading a book or the
paper.

There are lots of good snacks, some quite exotic.  The weirdest I had was
shredded dried squid.  In Japan it is quite common to discover a new
snack, descide that you love it, and then be unable to ever find that
particular thing again.

Historically the Japanese have not had a sweet tooth, so things like cake
and cookies are viewed as "Western".  An interesting dilemma:  the urge to be
western, and the urge to be traditional.  With cake this conflict is
resolved by having sweets which are not very sweet.  These in fact taste
quite good.

        RANDOM CULTURE

Japan is an intensely safe place.  While there, I felt palpably secure and
un-worried about my surroundings.  One of the great things about this is that
you can go to really crummy parts of town (which are often the most
interesting) and not be worried at all.  The Japanese leave you alone and want
to be left alone.  I might add that Japan is the best place I know of for
women to travel alone.

The Japanese are gadget-crazy.  Even little hole in the wall restaurants have
electric eye doors.  The elevators all talk to you (nerve-wracking if you speak
Japanese, I am told.  "the doors are now closing.  The elevator is going up.
Please be careful.  The doors are now opening..."  The digital office in
Edogawabashii had electric eye faucets which turned on automatically.

They really do have men in white gloves who will push you onto the train. We
got pushed one day.  Once or twice, it was hilarious, though I am sure it would
get dull pretty fast.  The concept of flex-time seems to elude the Japanese who
could really use it.  The trains are punctual to the second.  I honestly cannot
remember any train being even 10 seconds late.  One of the nice things about
this is that while rush hour might be more crowded than off hours, it doesn't
take any longer to get anywhere.  The trains are not cheap, but go everywhere,
and really are the principal option for transportation in Tokyo. (Read:  don't
even dream of renting a car in Tokyo).

The Japanese ride the train in complete silence.  It's like being in a
monestary on wheels.  Getting on and off is completely unpushy.  Everyone
getting on waits patiently at the sides of the door while those getting off
file out.  Then those waiting go in.  Mothers with babes, and older folks do
not seem to merit any special favors and seldom are offered a seat.  (Just like
in Boston).

The trains are full of junk-culture ads.  Mostly for english language schools,
and wedding consultants (favorite name:  "My Wedding Mamma").  Western weddings
are big there.  So are Eastern weddings.  The solution:  most people have one
of each, often at the same time.

We went out to see Kara-Oke one night.   This is Japanese "air-singing" and is
a real must for afficianadoes of the ridiculous.  Japanese "Salary-Man" (their
word for business man), get up and make like Frank Sinatra et alia, to backing
tapes.  The guys we went with went up and did it, though neither Neil or I
sang.  My reason for not going was that everyone else sounded pretty good and I
didn't want to drastically lower the quality of singing in the bar (or so I
told myself).  Neil's reason was there was no way in hell he was going up
there.  Salary-men get bombed many nights a week and can be seen passed, or
hanging on to lamp-posts all over Tokyo.  They are perfectly harmless, and
generally have had all of two or possibly three glasses of booze.

Apparently it's very common for gaijin to get hooked on Sumo wresting.  We
certainly did.  In the absence of the Celtics, we followed the entire
tournament, which happened to coincide perfectly with the trip.  Jenny kept
emitting:  "oh how unattractive!!", but she was eventually won over.  The big
news was that one of the big shots (ozeki Asahio) had a terrible tournament and
retired halfway through.  There is an American who has risen to the second
highest rank.  He is American-Samoan, and weighs about 12000 pounds.  The
tournament runs 15 days (six times a year), with each guy wrestling once a day.
It gets really exciting towards the end.  There is a digest showing all of the
day's matches in rapid sequence at 11:00, which relieves some of the potential
boredom of real-time (Baseball can seem brisk in comparison).

There is a  Mr Donut shop in Shinjuku which has to be the most fabulous donut
emporium in the universe.  It is kistch/donuts taken to its logical extreme.
Three stories, neon, glittering, fifties.  Another one for the lovers of the
sublime.

        WATER

We went to the public bath (Sento) one day. They are easily spotted by their
tall white chimneys, though they are apparently not nearly so numerous as they
used to be. At any rate there are stil lots of them.  You pay about 3 dollars,
and enter what I must describe as Water-world.  Just fabulous.  This sento like
most was  segregated by sex (thanks to MacArthur), and everyone is naked.  The
room is  quite large and completely tiled.  You sit on a small stool at a low
shower  stand and bathe for a long time, getting as clean as possible.  It is
imperative that you wash all of the soap off.  Then you enter the bath which is
usually in two parts:  a small round tub (fitting perhaps 4 or 5 people) with
hot water, and a larger rectangular tub fitting about 8 people with very very
hot water.  Most people use the hotter tub, which was just at my limit of
hot-water tolerance.  After soaking for a minute or two most people get out and
shower again. There never seems to be a problem with corwding in the bath
itself, as the warmth of the water keeps people moving along.

The sento was mostly inhabited with college student looking people.  One
somewhat rotund fellow fell flat on his heinie, and the entire place erupted
in laughter (I think they mostly knew one another).  The laughter was not
malicious, but it really struck me because I instantly realized that one seldom
if ever hears Japanese folks laughing out loud.

While in Nikko we visited a spa (Onsen) north of lake chuzenjii and bathed in a
sulphuric hot spring.  This was fantastic, a must.  The spa had both an in-door
bath and an out-door bath.  We had to forcefully convince the bath-keeper that
we indeed wanted to go to the outdoor bath.  She assumed that since it was cold
and snowing lightly that we would wish to remain indoors.  The entire spa was
desserted, since it was mid-week off-season.  Japan is very kind to off-season
travelers, and probably a terrible place to visit whenever Japanese  vacation
time rolls around.

In this case we were not required to shower profusely before entering the bath,
though I cannot remember why.  The water was murky green and quite warm.
Once again we stripped and got in (our party was co-ed, consisting of Neil,
Jenny and Me).  The bath is not large, perhaps fitting 7 or 8 people.  We were
the only ones there.  Snow fell gently, as Neil regaled us with tales of the
night before.  The perfect moment.

        JAPANESE INNS

While in Tokyo we stayed in a Japanese Inn (Ryokan, two syllables).  This
particular inn was located for us by some folks at Nihon-Dec.  The Inn
features tatami-rooms (with rice paper doors) and bamboo walls, where you sleep
on futons, and bathe in a large tub somewhat like a sento.  Our place had lots
of charm, run by very friendly folks.  The Inn has a small garden in its
courtyard with trickling water.  We found the Inn to be ideal, especially since
we're allergic to large hotels.

Some ryokan are reluctant to accept foreigners, so it is best to ask a Japanese
person to call up and make sure it's okay.  Also, once situated in one, it is
okay to ask them to telephone one in the next city you are visiting and help
you make reservations.  In Japan reserving at least one day ahead is an
excellent idea.

        PRICES

JAPAN is not cheap, but the western media has completely missed the point with
their lurid reporting of the prices in Japan.  It seems to me that more than
half the features on Japan feature a little spectacle where the reporter carts
out some bizarre prices as if to say:  "Look they may be eating our lunch on
the world's markets, but at least we don't have to pay a thousand dollars for a
game of golf!".  The items cited are usually the following:  melons, golf and
steak dinners.  "If you were to enjoy a steak dinner in Tokyo it would cost
you $300...".  The implication is that everything is priced accordingly which
of course is patently false.

If you go to Japan and live and eat as the Japanese do, it is perfectly
reasonably priced, similar to prices in the US.

        WESTERN MEDIA

The problem is that the western media takes everything out of context.
But in Japan, context is everything.  When I got there I realized that
almost everything I had ever heard was just plain non-sense.

        REPATRIATION

Repatriation to the states was pretty difficult for me.  Turning on the news
after being news-free for three weeks was a real shock.  Death, despair and
malaise is endemic.  This doesn't have anything to do with Japan per se,
but I just couldn't believe it.

On a more personal note, everything seemed too something or other:  too salty,
too soft, etc.  After sleeping on a futon for three weeks, we got in our
western bed, and I thought "how decadent!".  But then I thought:  the  Japanese
are actually more decadent than we are.  Nevertheless, our bed is smotheringly
soft.  This internal dialogue continues to play out daily against a back-drop
of route 128, star market, the news and other assorted ennui.

                    'SCDS' AND THE FALLACY OF CAREER

                         by G.T. Berlander
                        -------------------

Recently, a good friend's professional life expired from what has been
identified as the fastest-growing threat to middle-class workers --
SUDDEN CAREER DEATH SYNDROME (SCDS, pronounced 'skids'). Having started
with her company when she was just 19, she spent 26 years working her
way up from unskilled work to middle management, in charge of many
people and contributing millions of dollars worth of business. Then, in
a flash of managerial incomprehensability, she was gone, along with
about 90 fellow mid-managers.

It is now believed that Sudden Career Death Syndrome is striking as many
as one in every three career-oriented professionals, lower-, and
mid-level managers. Symptoms of SCDS include:

*  A Sudden Inability to get anyone to return your phone calls
*  Work which is left in limbo forever by one's superior
*  Loss of company credit cards
*  Prohibition on business travel, except to New Jersey
*  Omission from the annual Christmas party invitation list
*  Unexplained Cancellation of your subscription to Forbes
*  Finding you car ticketed repeatedly when parked in the company lotxxx
*  The Inexplicable Disappearance of your name from the company
   electronic mail net
*  A Shared Office in the parking lot, next to the dumpster

SCDS has most often appeared in Hollywood, where it seems to have
reached particularly ruinous proportions during the production of
"Heaven's Gate." While those in the entertainment and financial
industries have appeared most susceptible to infection, SCDS is highly
virulent and now seems to threaten professionals and managers in all
industries.

For those in our generation, brought-up to believe in hard work creating
its own rewards (like a bee hive producing honey), SCDS is a cruel and
collosal betrayal. Like herpes and AIDS, SCDS seems almost a divine
retribution for past excesses, and like both, is terribly indescriminate
in who it hurts. The straight arrow grind is as likely to be struck-down
by SCDS as is the office flim-flam artist. Perhaps more likely.

However, SCDS may be looked-upon in one of two ways. It will be seen as
the end of the world by Yuppies -- as a sudden, devastating, and
inexplicable end to the career you thought you had. Then again, it may
be seen as a cold bucket of reality in the face -- reminding you that
plans for a "career" are as useful as the map to the Lost Diablo you
purchased from a street vendor in Nuevo Laredo during your last visit to
Mexico.

For the fact is that SCDS devastates most only those who allow
themselves to become victims -- those for whom there is no identity
outside of the job and for whom anything but a natural and unstoppable
upward career path seemed unthinkable. Such poor souls have not yet
traversed enough of the Working Learning Curve to be able to devine its
entirety:

1. Stage One: Rearin' to Go. Finally out of school and finished with
formal training, you can't wait to get out there and show the world your
stuff. Vital to this stage is an employer who you can dazzle with your
competence and dedication. This stage may last through several jobs with
several employers if no one position allows you to properly 'show what
you're made of.' Typically during Stage One, you will become afflicted
with amoebic dysentery while on a two-week business trip, yet will
refuse to miss a single appointment -- even though you are forced to
bolt to the toilet every twenty minutes during the day and sleep on the
bathroom floor every night for the two weeks. After all, your employer
is counting upon you!

2. Stage Two: Those Dirty Bastards! Several months after your trip to
Bathroom Hell, you are given a 3% annual raise while the youngster
recently hired into your department is given the promotion you were
promised. S/he has less training and experience than you, but *does* go
out drinking with the boss. You go into a flat spin which overwhelms
your life for several weeks before you come to realize several things:
first, "THERE ARE FAR MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE THAN THERE ARE MEANINGFUL
JOBS TO EMPLOY THEIR TALENTS" (Primary Law of Inverse Vocational
Dynamics)(1), and second, "MONEY DOESN'T CARE WHO IT GOES TO"(2). You
are thus left with the conviction that, since an employer is blind to
good work and dedication, you will do just what you have to do to keep
your job and stay out of trouble. After you leave this company.

3. Stage Three: California Chameleon. You now realize that an employer
sees you only as a human kleenex -- a cheap, disposable medium in which
to deposit something nasty. Thus, you will expend what energy is
necessary to keep your job, but not an erg more. And you will silently
rage at your employer for his stupidity, short-sightedness, and greed.
This stage may be as short as several months or as long as the rest of
your life.

4. Stage Four: Looking for Mr./Ms. Goodjob (the LOJ). You may or may not
reach this stage, but should try to. For the realization hits one day
that top management -- of any company -- seeks to run business based
upon the Red Queen's advice to Alice during her tour of Wonderland:
"WHEN IN DANGER OR IN DOUBT, RUN IN CIRCLES, SCREAM AND SHOUT!"(3).
Since this is guaranteed to result in managerial short-sightedness and
inexplicable actions, a company's callous, moronic behavior is thus an
impersonal thing, neither worth getting enraged about nor overly
defensive towards. Rather, wouldn't it make the most sense to look for a
position which affords the least objectionable features (The Least
Objectionable Job Strategy), while offering both reasonable pay and some
sense of personal accomplishment? For you now know that this is the best
you can reach for without making yourself critically vulnerable to SCDS.

For while Sudden Career Death Syndrome can strike anyone, it is
devastating only to those who are trapped in the earlier Stages of
career awareness. And since there is no known cure for SCDS, it is
imperative that the worker/professional be aware of the following
preventatives:

*  A Reordering of personal priorities, such that one no longer seeks to
   define his or her identity through a job which may be ephemeral at
   best and intangible at worst; remember that "S/he who lives by the
   job, dies by the job"

*  Qualification in more than one line of work (the 'not all the eggs in
   one basket' tactic); holding certification in several different
   professions or trades is an excellent way of living by the Latin
   motto 'illigitamus non carborundum'(4), as well as a way of
   continually enriching one's life

*  Reactivation of the now scorned goal of ensuring that the educational
   establishment teaches students more than accounting and linear
   transportation; if you can tell the difference between archaeology
   and Archimedes you may be able to dance out of the way the next time
   an ill wind blows a batch of SCDS microbes your way

And as a last resort for those who are yet unable or unwilling to to
move to higher stages of career awareness, effected, I recommend the
establishment of a network of SCDS support groups under the national
umbrella name of Psyches Anonymous. Patterned after the successful
Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon, it may offer the most short-term help
to those who have suddenly found themselves "on the SCDS."

So Desperados, or Diabolos as one new subscriber would have it, I leave you
with last issue's image of Publisher John Covert on a nude beach in
France and this issues immage of your editor-founder jacking lumber in
northern New Hampshire.  I am off there for a week's vacation.  If I have
time this afternoon, I have one more issue's worth of special backlock edition,
but if not, I'll see you in a week (or so),

Have a nice dream,
