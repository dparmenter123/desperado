                SCIENTISTS FIND KEY TO QUANTUM THEORY

by Lee Dembar
Los Angeles Times

        In a major breakthrough in chemistry, researchers at Stanford
University and the Los Alamos National Laboratory have conducted
experiments that open the way for a comprehensive understanding of
the quantum theory - the dynamics of all chemical reactions.

        Richard N. Zare, of Stanford, Calif., and James J. Valentini of
Los Alamos, N.M., have independently found a technique for observing and
measuring the quantum states of the products of a chemical reaction, a
key to understanding the mechanics of the reaction.

        Both used the simplest chemical reaction known - the so-called
hydrogen exchange reaction in which a hydrogen atom and a deuterium
molecule react to form deuterium hydride and a deuterium atom.

        Based on this work, researchers hope to gain insight into much
more complicated reactions, such as what goes on inside a flame or
during the creation of photochemical smog.

        The work, which has not yet been published, has excited the
chemistry community.

        "It's very significant."  Richard Bernstein of the University
of Claifornia, Los Angeles said Friday.  "It's something that all
chemists had hoped would happen.  In the field of chemical physics, this
is clearly the news of 1983."

        Since the invention of quantum mechanics more than 50 years ago,
chemists have been trying to predict the detailed outcome of chemical
reactions from first theoretical principles.  P.A.M. Dirac, one of the
century's foremost physicists, speculated that quantum mechanics would
make chemistry a subbranch of mathematics.

        In the last 15 years, researchers led by Aron Kuppermann of
the California Institute of Technology have developed the theory and
the computational ability to predict the dynamics of the hydrogen-
exchange reaction.  But until now, there has been no experimental
method to test the predictions and refine them.

        "For the first time now there is contact established between
theory and experiment." Bernstein said.

        "They've done very nice work," Kuppermann said Friday.  "It
is on the road to confirming the theoretical work that we've done.
Their method will then be very, very powerful in extending things well
beyond where theory is likely to be able to do."

        "The ultimate goal of all this is to use this simple reaction
for which we can do sophisticated experiments and try to develop a
comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of this simple system."
said Valentini, who was assisted in his work by Dan Gerrity.  "Then
we can use that as a guide to understanding the dynamics of all chemical
reactions."

                MULLING OVER THE UNIVERSE WITH PAUL DIRAC

                            Stories by Andy Lindstrom

        The universe according to Paul Dirac is an awesome scape, somewhere
over the rainbow of common sense, where "God's language" is spoken and
parallel lines meet.

        Faster is slower in Dirac's world.  Up may be down, pushing may be
pulling and things rarely are where they seem to be.

        The celebrated "mystic of the atom" during his Cambridge days and
Florida State University's (and perhaps the world's) most impressive
monument to scientific genius is certainly a challenge for the average
brain.

        "What projects am I working on?" he replies to a question.  "I am
mulling it over."

        Dirac dreams of finding one set of laws to explain the whole
universe and its workings.

        No map can describe such a riddling place "without introducing
irrelevancies." Dirac says.  To draw its picture is "like a blind man
sensing a snowflake.  One touch and it's gone."

        Matter is nothing but jiggling waves.  Sometimes energy hurtles
about like legions of tiny bowling balls; sometimes it scatters like
ripples on a pond.

        Dirac's Equation, which earned him that ultimate academic laurel, a
Nobel Prize, treats it as both at once.

        His is the world of modern theoretical physics, the world of quantum
mechanics and relativity:

        The Big Bang, Star Wars, E.T. and Dr. Who were born there.

        Space flight, electronic communications, computer technology and
automatic garage-door openers were hatched there.

        The secrets of where we came from what we are and where we're going
are hiding out there.

        "God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world." Dirac says.
"Beautiful but not simple."

        "My theories are based on a faith that there is reason for all the
numbers nature provides us with.  You will learn more out of this than from
studying the Bible."

        But such a feat of "beautiful mathematics" is at once so grand and
so far beyond present knowledge that he can only make small talk with his
colleagues and ponder physics with the stars.

        This is a man whose powers of concentration give new meaning to the
word terse.

        At Cambridge, fellow students created a fictional unit of conversation
called a "dirac": one sentence in a light year (a concept that must disturb
greatly his demand for exactness, because a light year is a measure of distance,
not time).

        "The more you can encompass in little, the better off you are,"
is one of his dictums.  "Never speak about things you cannot know," is another.
And like everything else he considers, Dirac takes both to their absolute,
literal, unbending limits.

        He turned down English knighthood, a friend said, "because it would
have meant having to lunch with the Queen whenever she called."

        Later, he accepted the far more prestigious Order of Merit (he is
one of 24 living members) only when it was pointed out that even Winston
Churchill came aboard.  But when asked how he found Elizabeth II, who hung
the medal around his neck, his two-word reply was:  "Very small."

        "Actually, I have never seen him so talkative as he is now," says
his long-time assistant, Leopold Halpern.  "In his early days, he
extremely 'saving' with his words.  It was said about him he had only three
phrases:  yes, no and I don't know."

        He has been called the world's greatest scientist, the greatest
living Englishman, "the one who made modern physics."

        His response:  "I was just looking for some pretty mathematics.
Anyone could have done it."

        His great contributions to theoretical physics - the last great
breakthroughs in the field - were written more than 50 years ago, and yet
"whenever he talks, it's always standing room only." says a fellow
professor.  "It's like listening to Newton talk about the apple.  Having
Shakespeare read his plays.  Even the faculty - no, especially the faculty -
stand in awe."

        He is honored, even revered wherever scientists gather ("He is one
of my gods." Nobel laureate Rosalyn Yalow recently said), yet his greatest
pleasure comes in solitary walks along the fire trails or in swimming
in the frigidly clear sinkholes of his adopted Florida home.

        "The water is warm," he says, "compared to the North Sea."

        In a field where staggeringly expensive high-tech hardware is
paraded about like Red Army missiles on May Day, his research facilities
consist of the following:  a pencil, several sheets of blank paper, a thumb-
sized rubber eraser and the sharp, clear prism of his mind.

        He accepts no honorary degrees, hates politics and never votes,
explains little ("Books have been written on that," he says, rather sharply),
rarely gives interviews or answers letters and is often a mystery even to
those in his field.

        "Exactly what he's done isn't very easy for normal people to
understand," says Bruce Hellman, his graduate assistant.  "People who study
physics often don't."

        He has been laughed at, ridiculed, ignored, called a maverick, a
loner, a wooly-headed dreamer, waspish, cranky, obtuse, opinionated,
impractical, impossible and just a downright ornery old man.

        A famous colleague, Neils Bohr, once wrote a satire about one of
Dirac's theories and titled it "How to Catch Elephants Alive."  Simply post
the theory at their water hole, Bohr said, and the elephants will be so
confused you can walk up and tie their legs.

        Another, Wolfgang Pauli, proposed what he called the "Second Pauli
Principle" regarding Dirac's theory of black holes in space that swallow
any matter passing by.

        Any theory, said Pauli with his tongue firmly in cheek, would
immediately apply to its author and Dirac would be sucked up whole before
he could tell anyone about it.

        But there is another side, too.  In Tallahassee, he is known to many
as a fascinating lecturer, witty story teller, delightful host and charming
companion.

        He reads Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen and Sherlock Holmes; watches
"Nova," "Masterpiece Theater" and mystery shows; loves classical music and
dining out; hates the acoustics in the civic center and thinks Tallahassee
drivers are a perfect fright.

        "Away from his work," says music professor Edward Kilenyi, a family
friend, "Paul is like everybody else."

        "A conservative thinker, but very kind.  He can tell very funny
stories and often goes out.  He just doesn't chitchat very much."

        And as both Bohr and Pauli found to their discomfort, his major
predictions almost always have been right.

        Skeptics still hold, out against his more mind-bending theories,
but the search to prove them continues, and nobody dares to laugh any more.

        "He is a genius," Halpern says with Dirac-like economy.  "But he
does not like to discuss subjects that are too vague to deal with."

        "He likes his questions short and precise, yes.  He is really a
very modest man and speaks few words.  But he says a lot."

        "Dirac, P.A.M. - 311," reads the silver and black Department of
Physics directory at FSU's Keen Building.  A total of 41 names are on the board
and Dirac's fits with no fanfare between R.N. Diamond (514) and D.Duke (511).

        "I am here because I liked this best," he says, sitting in a tiny,
concrete-gray office three stories over the FSU campus.

        "I had several offers when I retired from Cambridge in 1969.
Princeton.  Stony Brook in New York.  Others.

        "Some of the offers were very nice, very comfortable.  But I chose
to come to Florida State because it is a center of excellence."

        According to a 1982 National Research Council study, FSU's physics
program is tied with those at Duke and the University of North Carolina as
the best in the Southeast; it is No. 37 among the nation's universities.

        "He likes it here because we treat him just like one of the boys,"
adds physics professor Joe Lannutti, who has joined the interview as
buffer, iterpreter and palace guard.

        "And because we're the top physics department in the Southeast.
Dirac himself compared our program to that at Cambridge.  He came because
the research is here.  Not because of the sunshine."

        An empty blackboard fills the back wall, with an FRM calendar and
its four-color farm scene beside it.  Three rows of intensely proper
people with names like Pauli, Heizenberg, Planck, Schroedinger and Bohr
peer down from a 1927 photo over the orange-draped cot where Dirac takes
his afternoon nap.  ("Do not disturb before 3 p.m." Hellman warns.)

        In the photo, P.A.M. Dirac, a wide-eyed young man in wing collar
and black wool suit, sits directly behind A. Einstein and two down from
the only woman, Madame Marie Curie.

        Of the group, Dirac is the last.

        He is a painfully spare man, midway through his 80th year, stoop-
shouldered and frail, drawing in on himself like one of the collapsing stars
he predicted, quick to tire but patient with the interruption ("Dirac does
not like interviews," Halpern had warned.  "He is usually of the opinion
the quotations are not accurate").

        "I do not like to talk about myself." Dirac says with a wan smile.
His voice has always been a whisper, reed-thin and clear.  But the thick
black hair of his younger days has retreated to a wispy cowl at the very
fringes of his forehead, as though worn away by the great thoughts
fermenting below.

        A web of wrinkles etches his gentle, lonely face, outlining eyes
that seem to be forever questing some Holy Grail.  His rumpled black suit
is almost a metaphor for Einstein's concept of infinity:  Its 1950s style
has gone full circle and soon may be back.

        ("He is one of the two worst-dressed men I have ever seen,"
concedes Margit Dirac, his wife of 46 years.  "Einstein was the other.
But then at Cambridge it was bad form to dress; they all looked like
tramps.")

        Correspondence from all parts of the world litters Dirac's desk,
weighted down by several pairs of glasses and a magnifying glass with no
handle that was his father's.

        Books and papers - "Daedalus," "Notes and Records of the Royal
Society of London."  Physics for Flying Saucers" - overflow onto the floor
and scramble about in several bookshelves.

        "He gets written to by everybody in the world," a colleague explains.
"He doesn't answer most because then they can say, "This is what Dirac says."

        Mrs. Dirac has said he will go to San Remo, Italy, in May for the
150th anniversary of Alfred Nobel's birth.  Later he will travel to the
Vatican to meet with Pope John Paul, perhaps draft a joint statement
opposing the nuclear arms race.  Finally, he is scheduled to join a major
conference of Nobel winners at Ettore Majoiana, Sicily, an event he has
enjoyed the past few summers.

        "No," he says to these suggestions.  "I don't think I'll be
well enough to attend any of those."

        "I'm very much disturbed about nuclear war - my conclusions are
that no survivors will remain in the northern hemisphere, 30 percent in
the south, in a horrible world.  But I don't see anything I can do.

        "Perhaps I will be able to go to Sicily later in the summer."

        His often-reported friendship with Albert Einstein is brought
up.  His wife had said that he cried at the news of Einstein's death,
and that he traveled the world to science meetings devoted to
Einstein's work.  "I did not know him ver well," he says.  "I was
not working with him when I was a Princeton."

        Mention is made that the magnetic monopole, a particle whose
existence he predicted in the 1930s, may have been discovered.
"Nothing conclusive," he says.

        Of recent advances in theoretical physics, he says, "I
don't believe in those theories."

        In fact, Dirac says, the science of physics has been chasing up
blind alleys for at least the past 30 years.

        "It has too many ambiguities,"  Halpern explains.  "Dirac
wants a clean and correct mathematics to explain things.  This is what
he means by beautiful mathematics.  Anything less would no satisfy
his intellectual rigor."

        Paul Adrian Maurice Dirac came into the world of intellectual
rigor in Bristol, England, the son of a Swiss-born, autocratic private-
school master and an English mother.  The date was Aug. 8, 1902.

        His family originally was from the west of France, Margit Dirac
says, displaying a postcard picture of a fortress-like stone castle
named Chateau Dirac.  Cadillac, Cognac and Dirac were neighboring farm
towns, but the aristocratic Diracs fled to Switzerland during the
French Revolution and Napoleonic years.  Later, Paul's father went to
England as a teacher of French.

        Paul Dirac was always known as something of a loner during his
school years in Bristol, an abstract dreamer interested in theories
of physical behavior.

        At 21, he earned a degree in electrical engineering from
Bristol University.  Then, unable to find work in his field, he took a
fellowship at St. John's College, Cambridge, for advanced study in
physics and mathematics.

        Three years later, he developed Dirac's Equation, a
mathematical explanation for atomic behavior that guaranteed his place
in the history of science.

        "Dirac is the one who made modern physics," explains FSU
physicist Steve Edwards.  "Einstein gave us relativity for the
universe as a whole, and several people worked on quantum mechanics
to explain what goes on in an atom.

        "But it was Dirac's equation that brought the two together
and gave us the fundamental theories to describe nature that we use
today."

        In 1933, Dirac shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Erwin
Schroedinger, the physicist whose quantum-wave theory he completed.

        Dirac's Equation explained fully the mechanics of an atom,
and it sets Dirac off on a 50-year quest that continues today.

        "Dirac's Equation treated single electrons," explains FSU
physicist Dennis Duke.  "The next step was to develop a field
theory - infinite numbers of electrons working together as a
single system.

        Actually, he was successful.  It is considered the most
ssuccessful of all physical theories in explaining natural behaior.
But Dirac never accepted it.  He considers the math questionable.

        But other physicists have been awarded the Nobel Prize for
work using Dirac's quantum electrodynamics theory, as it it
called.

        "Dirac will not be satisfied until it is possible to
describe all physics as one kind of universe." Halpern says.
"There must be a way."

        But the prize has eluded him.

        Until 1969 he remained at Cambridge, professor of
physics in the Lucasian chair that Isaac Newton first held.

        His ideas were tested by experimental physicists at
Cambridge's famed Cavendish Laboratory.  He took sabaticals to
Gottingen in Germany, Bohr's Institute for Theoretical Physics
in Denmark, Princeton in New Jersey, where Einstein was working.

        He worked next to Robert Oppenheimer, who later
coordinated the American atom bomb program, and with Peter
Kapitza, a czarist general's son who refused Stalin's demand to
develop a Russian bomb and was a pioneer in low-temperature
super-conducters, which make high-speed computers possible.

        But for the most part, Dirac worked alone, "as if in a
dream," wrote physicist George Gamow, "holding a soliloquy with
rows of symbols chalked on the board.

        "Even when others were present, he hardly ever used
words.  Even the initiated could not always follow his mental
processes."

        In 1937, he married Hungarian-born Margit Wigner, the
sister of Nobel physicist Eugene Wigner.  ("Who proposed?"  she
replies with a wink.  "I will not say.  But I liked him the
first time I saw him.")

        The wedding took place in a Cambridge pub.  A son and
three daughters followed.  The son teaches mathematics in
Denmark.  One daughter is a geologist in San Diego, another
disappeared under mysterious circumstances several years ago,
and the third, Mary Colleraine, lives in Tallahassee.

        And the search continued.  After mandatory retirement
from Cambridge, he accepted FSU's offer in l970.  The salary
was $36,000.  It has grown to $55,122.99 ("Not astronomical."
Lannutti says, "but more than anyone else in the department is
making.")

        He is still classified as "resident alien - British."
His personnel profile is spare but complete, like his equations:
"Education - Ph.D. 1926 Cambridge U. Honors, publications, etc.
- Nobel Prize in Physics."

        "We like it very much here," Mrs. Dirac says.  "So
many nice people.  And Paul has time to do his work."

        In Dirac's study, a framed manuscript reads "P.A.M.
Dirac, Fellow of the Royal Society, Professor of Physics at
the Florida State University, (signed) Elizabeth the Second."
Over his desk, where his gaze must often stray as he "mulls
it all over." is a Remington-like oil painting of a cowboy
and his horse caught in a deep snow.

        "We were five days caught in the snow at Long Island
when we first came," Mrs. Dirac syas.  "That reminds Paul why
he chose here."

        Dirac does not like to talk about such "irrelevancies,"
but Halpern has his own theory of how the search will end.  "A
physicist only stops physics when he doesn't breathe any more,"
he says.

        "And then for his tombstone, I suspect, (Dirac) will
say, 'Put nothing on it.'  Others must find the way."
