Well, fans, there's hot news this morning! I just learned that Pinchas
Zuckerman, the violinist, who used to be married to Eugenia Zuckerman,
the flautist,  has repudiated the poor thing and married, get this,
Tuesday Weld! Tuesday Weld, I'll trouble you!

Not only THAT, but I just learned from the columns of my favorite sports
magazine, Opera News, that the long-lost soprano Teresa Stratas has stopped
hanging out with that dude in Oregon, Bhagwan Rajneesh Shree, the man with
all the Royces, Rolls, gurus, for the use of, and is going to do a show on
BROADWAY. Honestly, she should have stood in the Cascades.

But all kidding aside, I also heard that Peter Pears, the archetypal
English tenor, has gone to sing Te Deums with the sons of the morning, sadly
missed by lovers of utter purity.

(Tom warned me about this, you know. He said, "Stay out of it as much as
possible." It's been a year, kids, I think I earned that little outburst.)

More to the point, there isn't a shoe in [Imelda Marcos'] collection that is
actually made for walking.  That isn't all that unusual.  Women have stopped
wearing corsets and girdles, long sleeves in summer and miniskirts in
winter.  In China they have stopped binding feet; and in America, yuppies
now dash from one appointment to another in running shoes.

But for the most part, women still spend their social lives hobbled.  No
one has yet designed a shoe that looks like a spike and feels like a sneaker.
So, we go along putting round toes in pointed shoes, flat feet on heels.
What we want most to do with shoes is take them off.

As long as we're on the subject of shoes...

"I had to choose between my feet and shoes, and I chose feet.
I think women should be free to wear more comfortable shoes
and not feel that to be sexy, they have to wear five-inch heels.
Five-inch heels are fine if you're in bed."

Subj:   vocabulary by imagination

It's early in the year yet, but already there is a contender for best
new word of the year:  the following sentence comes from a seminar
announcement here at ZK, Digital's Technospeak center.

"...The prototype subsequently generated a grammar capable of correctly parsing
a majority of the inputs that could be parsed by the human operator, and
also capable of a very high rate of disambiguation."

Naturally, there is no need to disambiguate the last word of the sentence,
it can be contextualized.

Subj:   Pia Zadora

A radio station here reported a story about Pia Zadora that I thought
was pretty darn funny.

It seems that she was trying to give her acting reputation a little shot
in the arm so she was doing some live theater in Europe. Specifically,
she was playing Anne in the stage adaption of The Diary of Anne Frank. She
was so horrendous in the part, however, that when the scene came where the
Nazis enter the home in which the Franks were hiding out, the audience started
screaming "She's in the attic! She's in the attic!"

        There was this small church near Hastings, Ontario that was in
need of a paint job. The board decided to contract someone to do the
job and put an ad in the newspaper.
        The board received several replies, most of which were quoting
about $2000 for the job, but there was one for $300 and the board decided
to check this one out. There person was in his mid-fifties and looked
competent so the board decided to  hire him.

        The man was painting away merrily when he realizes at the half
way point that he doesn't have enough paint. He (Phred) got out his
paint thinner and dumped some in.
        When Phred was 3/4 of the way done he had the same problem so
he dumped in more thinner.
        Now he only had one more 30 cm bit to do on the steeple but he
was almost out of paint. He dumped in the last of his thinner and
barely finished the job.

        At that point a rain storm appeared and washed all the paint away.

        A loud booming voice from above said
        "REPAINT! REPAINT! AND THIN NO MORE!"

Subj:   Return of the bumper sticker

Lest you think bumper stickers too frivolous for the serious journalism of
today's Desperado :-), consider the following article, from a recent NY
Times:

Diplomats Seek Safety In Bumper Stickers

To:     All Ambassadors and Consuls General
From:   Gillian Martin Sorensen, Commissioner for the United Nations and
        Consular Corps.

"Some of you have expressed concern about the apparent increase in petty
vandalism directed at diplomatic vehicles since the highly visible Fedral
license plates were introduced last year.

"While the police are doing all they can to protect your vehicles, one
diplomat has found added protection from a simple, yet ingenious, measure:

"By placing an 'I &lt;heart&gt; N Y' bumper sticker on his car, this former victim
of car vandals has found that his car is now left in peace.

"In the hope that one diplomat's success can be duplicated throughout the
community, we are enclosing a bumper sticker for your vehicle, if you wish.
Should you or your staff desire more, please call our office."

More?  Hundreds more.  Since this memorandum was sent out three weeks ago, the
response has been "unbelievable," Commissioner Sorensen said yesterday.

China wants 40 bumper stickers; Haiti, 25; India, 20; Jordan, 10, and the Holy
See, 4.  The Soviet Union apparently does not love New York, but Hungary wants
7 decals.  With about 1,000 vehicles, the city's diplomatic corps has already
asked for 400 bumper stickers.

There was an article in the Wall Street Journal last week about Ken
Olsen and Digital.  (The accompanying picture of KO was actually a
picture of some other CEO named James Olsen.)  Himself was quoted as
telling what the Journal called a "risque" story about IBM:

    The wife of an IBM salesman goes to a sex counsellor and complains
    that her marriage is still unconsumated.  "He sits on the end of
    the bed and tells me how great it's going to be in three years."

From Bill Laurune, this fable:

    In a little village lived a tiny woman who worked as a seamstress.
    All day long, until it grew too dark to see, she would sit at her
    window, sewing.  Her work was beautiful, and people came from far
    away to admire it.  When they asked her the secret of her craft,
    she would smile slyly and say, "The thimble, the golden thimble,"
    and hold up her finger to display her shining treasure.  "A
    magician gave it to me when I was a girl.  Thanks to my golden
    thimble, I can do what I do."
        Years went by, and the woman grew old.  Finally she could no
    longer see well enough to work.  All the maidens in the village
    yearned for the golden thimble, each one dreaming of the wonderful
    things she could make under its magical influence.  At last the
    old woman decided to give her thimble to the woodcutter's
    beautiful daughter.  The old seamstress handed the thimble to the
    young woman, kissed her gently, and said, "Guard it carefully. It
    is yours."
        The woodcutter's daughter returned home with her precious gift
    and immediately sat down to work on her own wedding dress.  But
    the stitches all came out crooked, the hem fell, and the laces,
    for some reason, would not lace.  The maiden angrily went back to
    the old woman and threw the golden thimble in her lap.  "It doesn't
    work!"  And she told the old seamstress what had happened.
        The old seamstress listened carefully to the maiden's story.
    Then she looked shrewdly at the woodcutter's daughter and said, "Of
    course it didn't work for you.  You're an idiot."

The short notice for auditions and the short rehearsal period are due
to extreme procrastination on the part of the production staff.  Since
all four operas will be presented at each performance, two full casts
will be needed; the evening performance on the 17th needs to begin
before the end of the matinee.

   Rhode Island's capital city shut down for the day. A battleship
steamed up Iowa's Cedar River to put down a territorial dispute.
Residents of one city were told to flush all their toilets at the
same time to force an alligator out of the sewers.
   April Fool! The traditional day of gags, goofs, pranks,
practical jokes and simple tomfoolery was celebrated on the pages
of newspapers and in radio broadcasts around the country Tuesday.
   Hundreds of residents of Providence, R.I., called authorities
and a rival radio station to check out a report on WJHY-FM that the
city was going to shut down for the day.
   ``We didn't think the entire city would be convulsed,''
assistant program director Glenn Stewart said Tuesday. ``I don't
know what it says about the listeners. I guess many people just
didn't realize it was April Fool's Day.''
   Disc jockey Carolyn Fox announced that a fictitious ``Providence
Labor Action Relations Board Committee'' had decided the city would
be closed and that people should go home. She gave the telephone
number of a cross-town rival, WPRO-AM, for people to call for more
information.
   In Illinois, Tuesday's Centralia Evening Sentinel reported the
city may levy taxes based on the sins residents commit, hot air
balloons will be used to harvest apples in the area, and
people are being urged to flush their toilets all at once to sweep
a 10-foot alligator out of the sewer system.
   ``I think the average intelligence of the person will tell them
before they finish the story that there is something wrong here.
Something is not right,'' managing editor Marietta Broughton said
Tuesday.
   The Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette published a doctored picture
Tuesday showing a large battleship on the Cedar River next to City
Hall.
   The picture's caption read: ``President Reagan Monday dispatched
the battleship USS Iowa to patrol the Cedar River after rumors
circulated within the government that Iowa's second largest city
was claiming the river as territorial waters,'' according to an
administration source.
   In San Francisco, readers were shaken by the announcement of a
massive eruption on placid Mount Tamalpais, plans for a Disney
complex at Rancho Seco nuclear plant and the move of the Giants to
Krakatoa, East of Java.

her for her charge card number, and she gave it to them
thinking the cost would be $15 to $25.  It turned out
to be $200!

Therefore, this person is giving the recipe to anyone

separate bowl:          4 cups flour
                        5 cups oatmeal (put small
 amounts of oatmeal in blender until it turns to
 powder.  Measure out 5 cups of oatmeal and only
 "powderize" that, NOT 5 cups "powderized" oatmeal)

                        2 tsp baking powder

Add:                    24 oz. bag of chocolate chips and
                        1 finely grated 8 oz Hershey bar (plain)

Add:                    3 cups chopped nuts (any kind)

Subj:   early personal computer reported

from  BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE   for  6 April 1986:

'FIRST' COMPUTER LINK FOUND BY MUSEUM?
by Rob Stein, UPI

A contest aimed at locating and saving artifacts that help trace the
development of the personal computer has unearthed a primitive machine
that might rewrite the history of the popular device.

Among 316 entries for the contest sponsored by The Computer Museum of
Boston was a machine known as the Kenbak 1 that could be the first
personal computer, according to Oliver Strimpel, curator of the museum.

"It's exciting to see these early examples," Strimpel said Friday.

The museum solicited entries for the contest over the past year and
received offerings from across the United States and 13 other nations
including France and Australia.

The contest was aimed at gathering important artifacts that could be
used to trace the development of personal computers, which have become
so popular over the last few years, he said.

The entries included a wide range of early software, manuals, advertising
and equipment, and several machines predating what had previously been
believed to be the first personal computer, Strimpel said.

Most computer historians had thought the Altair 8800, made by MTS Inc.
in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1975, was the first commercially produced
personal computer.

But the museum has received at least two entries manufactured and
marketed before the Altair, including one produced in 1971, Strimpel
said.

The Kenbak 1, made by the Kenbak Corp. of Los Angeles, sold for
about $750 and was apparently aimed at the educational market,
Strimpel said.

The 14-pound blue and silver machine, a metal box with a series of
buttons and lights on the front, could be programmed to do simple
functions such as arithmetic, he said.  The machine had a mere 256
bytes of memory, compared to the 1 million bytes that many personal
computers in use today offer.

Although the machine was far from a commercial success -- only about
40 were sold -- it appears to be the earliest version of what evolved
into today's Apple MacIntosh and IBM PC, Strimpel said.

The criteria for judging will be the entry's significance to the
development of personal computers, its rarity, originality and
condition, he said.

"So many people from California to France were putting microprocessors
into boxes in the 1970s and we've only heard about a few that made it
into the light of day through commercial success," said Strimpel.

Subj:   How to travel more safely

The following appeared on the front page of the Lawrence Eagle Tribune,
Lawrence, Massachusetts:

                     "HOW TO TRAVEL MORE SAFELY

                     A Salem, N.H. travel agency
                   offers security tips for its
                   customers who are traveling
                   abroad.

                     Going Places, Inc., suggests:

                   o  Select a wide-body  aircraft
                   where possible since "no multi-
                   aisle" aircraft has ever been
                   hijacked.

                   o  Wait to pick up baggage  until
                   everyone clears the area.  The
                   baggage area attracts crowds and is
                   vulnerable to attack.

                   o  Choose an airport used by
                   western carriers.  They will most
                   likely pressure local authorities
                   to ensure adequate security.

                   o  Fly airlines of neutral
                   countries when given a choice.

                   o  Be inconspicuous in dress  and
                   mannerisms.  Don't stress your
                   American nationality.  Another
                   passenger may remember it at the
                   wrong time and reveal it.

                   o  Avoid first class.   Hijackers
                   use this compartment for a command
                   post.

                   o  Avoid aisle seats because they
                   are too visible and too vulnerable.

                   o  Carry no papers that link  you
                   with the government if you are a
                   corporate traveler or tourist.

                   o  Leave valuables at home.

                   o  Bring extra medicine if  you need
                   it on a regular basis.

                   o  Don't carry racy  magazines and
                   alcohol with you.  They will anger
                   Moslem terrorists."

&gt; i don't care how many ra81's of data you have on me, and i don't care
&gt; how good you are at reconstructing me: once i'm dead, i'm dead.  you
&gt; can make copies of me until you're blue in the face, but *i*'ll still
&gt; be dead.

But for all you know, every time you go to sleep, someone could be
killing you and then replacing you with a copy of you, and you'd *never*
notice the difference!  So what difference does it make?  None at all!

Welcome aboard, MENTOR::LEITZ, but I feel I should warn you that not even
John Covert can forward Desperado to another planet.
