            It looks like what Norman Vincent Peale has called "our
        divinely-ordered capitalist system (wherein one could put God to
        work for oneself and maximize one's potential)" has once again
        filled a sorely-needed gap (as Gerald Ford once put it).  That's
        right!  I'm talking about those spiritual descendents of those
        little plastic hand-shaped things that stuck to the window and
        waved at nobody in particular whenever your car hit a pothole:
        those little "Baby on Board" signs.  (Baby on Board . . . wasn't
        that on the menu at L'Carnivoretheque?)
            Now there's a hazard sign for every conceivable occupation
        and avocation.  They've coming out with STOP signs and YIELD
        signs, too.  My favorite one is "DRIVER IN CAR."
            Maybe some truly useful ones will be made someday.  I would
        not mind seeing a little warning sign that says this:

            Then again, Free Enterprise must know what it's doing.  I'll
        wager that the guardians of liberty are now printing up bumper
        stickers that say "I (heart) MY &lt;BABY ON BOARD&gt;" or "I BRAKE FOR
        &lt;CHILD ABOARD&gt;."

                Hacker Rips "Lisp Machine Manual"
                --------------------------------

CAMBRIDGE, MA. Church members singing "O, How I Love Jesus" burned
3600 manuals, mice, and FEP proms after attending a seminar in which
an evangelist said the "Lisp Machine Manual" conveys a satanic message
to unwary readers.

About 75 teenagers attended the prom burning after the Tuesday night
seminar.

Our M. Ess, an evangelist, said the SI: package extols Satan when
disassambled. SI:RECORD-SOURCE-FILE-NAME contains the microcoded
message "the source is Satan," and "someone munged this file for
Satan," Rev. Ess said during the seminar. "Furthermore, it is
unnatural to be able to Meta-dot something that isn't declared with a
DEFUN, the way God and Steele indended," Ess continued. "Function
definition by artificial means is the first sign of demonic
possession."

EX-Stage Designer Exposes Underside of Rock

  Some rock music is tool in devil's hand, says seminar leader.

MANCHESTER-When Joseph Vieira meets today's hottest rock musicians,
they are impressed with his stories of Jimi Hendrix, Alice Cooper, Cream
and The Doors.  For 13 years, Vieira designed stages, lighting and
special effects for some of rock's best known artists.

Today, he has to be careful about what he says around rock musicians.

"I don't tell them I am a Christian," Vieira says.  In 1972, Vieira left
the industry, concerned about musicians' lifestyles and the effect their
music has on society...Vieira gradually came to believe that some rock
music is the devil's tool....

"I got fed up with what I now know was the occult...It was
becoming a pornographic, cultic nightmare...The music was not
being done for music, it was being used to promote perversion."

Money kept Vieira working in the industry until he toured with
Alice Cooper, [who]... believes he is possessed by a female demon...
Cooper performed Satanic rituals, including killing chickens to eat
their hearts, and drinking urine and blood on stage, Vieira recalls.
Vieira himself used "The Book of Magic" to create stage designs...

Although Vieira did not then relate his dissatisfaction with some
rock music to the devil, he now thinks Satan is at the songs' roots.
"It (heavy metal rock) was basically a market created by the
devil, manipulating the artists, manipulating the people."

When asked about backcasting, subliminal messages some believe can
be heard when a song is played backwards, Vieira says he too believes
they exist.

He says backcasting was talked about during his era in connection
with The Beatles' "White Album."  Some believe John Lennon wrote the song
"Number Nine" so that when played backward it says "Turn me on dead
man."  Satanic backcasting messages have been attributed to Electric
Light Orchestra, Styx and other groups...

AN AWESOME VISION

     Editor -- This morning I had an awesome vision.  In it, a multi-
colored unicorn in a fiber glass cowboy hat revealed something to me
which I must share with every person alive:  canned pineapples can save
the world.  The unicorn told me that if everyone on earth ate a can of
pineapples at the exact same time, all of the world's problems will
just dry up, and disappear.  I have spent the entirety of today in deep
meditation, seeking the true meaning of my vision.  I have been
enlightened that on Monday, May 26 at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time,
every single person on this earth must eat a can of pineapples.  My
meditation has also helped me realize what an enormous burden is on me
now, and how difficult it will be for me to educate all the world on
the wisdom of the multi-colored unicorn.  The salvation of the world
is at stake.

The comment in the last issue about the theme song from Mr. Ed revealing
Satanic messages when played backwards prompted me to remember a commentary
I heard on NPR sometime last week or the week before.

The commentator (whose name or affiliation I can't remember) remarked that
if something so innocuous as the Mr. Ed theme song had Satanic messages
in it, then what about rock music?  Sure enough, he discovered Satanic
messages when you played rock music records backwards.

To prove his point, he played about 30 seconds of the Rolling Stones'
"Sympathy for the Devil" on the air.  Then he played it backwards.
Out came Debbie Boone's "You Light Up My Life."

Subj:  Colorful names

From the DEC phone book:

Count     Color in last name

219       Brown
 96       White
 89       Green &amp; Greene
 39       Gray
 24       Black
  8       Silver
  6       Gold
  3       Blue
  2       Gelb (German for yellow)
  2       Violette
  1       Pink
  1       Orange
  1       Redd

Yes ,there does seem to be a pattern. What follows is pure speculation as to
the cause.

Brown, White, Gray, and Black are all skin and hair colors. If a family were
generally darker than their neighbors, they might be called Brown or Black.
Similarly, if they were lighter, they might be called Gray or White. Note that
calling light hair white is an older usage than yellow or blond.  The first
reference to "blond" in English is 15th century, and it became common only in
the 19th century. English family names were first given in the 11th century,
and by the 16th the process was complete.

Brown, Black, Gray, and Green are all colors of the land. A family might be
associated with green fields or woods, brown or black earth, or gray stones.

Brown, Black, Gray, Green and White are colors accessible to peasant dyers of
Northern Europe. Robin Hood could not have dressed his merry men in pink if he
had wanted to. The few intense reds and blues before coal tars were too
expensive for common use. A family might become known for wearing more green
or brown than their neighbors.

I think colors were almost never used as given names. Red is a nickname,
occasionally promoted to a given name. Rose and Violet, like Lily, Iris, or
Daisy, are really flower names. Rudy and Amber, like Pearl or Opal, are really
jewel names.

Some American family names were given at Ellis Island, which increased the
number of common family names.

Subj:   Shall I Gruntle You?

One of the engineers, who will remain nameless, has this handle for his
mail messages:

"THE DISGRUNTLED RECLUSE OF CXO ENGINEERING"  8-MAY-1986 10:54

After a little prodding about his handle, he offered this:

After having researched the burning question "if one can be disgruntled,
can one be gruntled" in Webster's dictionary, I have come to the following
conclusions:

        1. Webster does define "gruntle" as a verb meaning "to put in
           in good humor" as the antithesis of "disgruntle".  Obviously
           other synonyms would be placate, humor (verb), and "make into
           a fatted calf".  Appearantly one can be gruntled if he is about
           to be led to slaughter.

        2. An alternate definition of gruntle (the noun) is a pig nose.
           Being the flexible language that English is, one could then
           extrap0late that the verb would be to affix a pig nose to
           someone or something.  With Bethesda being what it is, this
           may not be an inappropriate addition to the language in the
           future.  Of course, under this context, one would be
           "disgruntled" if he were to have a pig nose surgically removed.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The Nature Company catalogue, one of the thousands sent daily to my
long-suffering mailbox, offers a full complement of animal noses for your
gruntling pleasure. You can, after the disgorgement of some sum just too high
for me, enjoy a fleeting resemblance to a pig, a rattlesnake, a crow (pace
ACMS), an elephant, and a number of other animals with distinctive beezers
which have temporarily slipped my mind. They offer bowties in the shape of
fish, too.

   Hollywood flickered the westward march of pioneers onto
Americans' screens large and small, but who will sing the song of
the computer pioneers struggling to gigabyte glory?
   Hamilton Gaillard, 72, of New City, N.Y., for one.
   Gaillard, a veteran of the days when 12,000 characters of memory
was a lot, wrote The CompuBug recently to let future generations
know what it was like in the ``old, old'' days of computing - say
26 years ago. Let those who can buy in a drugstore the kind of
computer that then existed only in dreams take note. Over to
Gaillard :
   ``Around 1960, the utility company where I was chief gas
engineer installed an IBM 1401 with 12k of magnetic core storage,
three tape drives, a card-punch machine and a line printer that
must have weighed a ton. It was then a state-of-the-art machine,
being all solid-state (transistors of course) and being software
programmable. Its predecessor was a vacuum-tube job with
interchangeable program boards, each covered with a myriad of
jumpers and measuring some two feet square.
   ``In this era, professional programmers were an elitist group
who cloaked themselves in an aura of mystique. During coffee
breaks, they may have chatted in machine code.
   ``In the engineering department, there were laborious and
recurrent analyses being done manually and it was tempting to put
this on the computer. So I discussed the problem with the EDP
manager and his chief programmer. His people were accounting
oriented and wrote only in assembly language. When they realized
the engineering problems involved math functions, they found that
their backlog of work covered at least a year.
   ``At that time there was a bright young chap in my department
who was a mathematics major taking night courses. He introduced me
to FORTRAN, which he was currently studying, and provided me with
some IBM literature, which I proceeded to digest at home. After a
few weeks, a program started to take shape on coding forms. The EDP
manager was condescending and agreed to have my creation key
punched and run. He may have figured that the best way to get me
off his back was to let me dive in - and sink.
   ``On the first trial, the computer printed the name of the
company on the top of the sheet - and quit. After at least a dozen
trials, the job was running close to completion. The last bug was
located and zapped and another try was made. You guessed it -
OVERFLOW.
   ``In those days, the procedure was to compile the source deck
(of punch cards) and produce an object deck (machine code), then
load the object deck and some test data. One nasty characteristic
of the compiler was that it quit on the first syntax error
encountered, so they had to be eliminated one at a time. Only after
that would the computer punch out the object deck. That still left
the logic errors which could be found only by running data.
   ``There was no such thing as editing!
   ``I didn't feel too embarassed by the number of trials. I wasn't
alone. The wastebaskets in the computer room were the size of
garbage cans and were filled with discarded decks of cards and
reams of fanfold. But OVERFLOW was a different cat. The next job
was to weed out a byte here and another there - such things as
looking for a no-longer-active label which could be reused -until,
on the verge of becoming a candidate for the loony bin, success!
What joy! What ecstasy! And addiction!
   ``One of my retirement hobbies is my TRS-80 (Tandy-Radio Shack)
Model 4 with 64,000 characters of memory and two floppy drives. I
almost feel lost in a sea of RAM and virtually unlimited mass
storage. The problems done on the IBM 1401 would be a breeze for
the desktop and much faster (except for the printer). Recent ads
indicating hundreds of kilobytes of RAM and 10 million-character
hard disks stagger my imagination. It would seem conducive to
sloppy programming. Maybe at 72 I'm getting `soft' in my thinking
but I somehow miss the challenge of working inside 12 k.''

Subject: EASYnet Milestone

A few years ago (1978) we had to split up our internal DECsystem-10
network because the ANF-10 networking products didn't work reliably on
a network of 50 nodes.  That wasn't considered surprising because not
many people had envisioned networks that "large" when the products
were designed.

Last Wednesday, the EASYnet, Digital's corporate computer network,
registered its 10,000th system and nobody even noticed.  Measured in
terms of number of nodes, that makes EASYnet the WORLD'S LARGEST
PRIVATE COMPUTER NETWORK.  We are currently adding over 100 new
systems per week, so we don't expect to be overtaken for a while.

The 10,000th node is a MicroVAX in MKO2, a system named PLANIT.  A
small memento and ceremony is planned to recognize this milestone in
the growth of EASYnet.

The fact that the network functions so well in this complex and
dynamic environment is a tribute to the quality of the Digital product
set (hardware and software, particularly DECnet) and the support teams
in Digital Telecommunications (both headquarters and field) and Field
Service.  We have every confidence that the network will continue to
operate smoothly as we move forward to our next target of 20,000
nodes.  At the present rate of growth, we expect to be there around
the end of FY87.

The significance of this event is two fold.  First, as the largest
user of Digital's products our experience operating a large corporate
network can provide insight into future customer requirements and
provides a "stress test" for the products.  Secondly, we serve as a
reference account and an example of how Digital's networking products
and services can be used to solve real business problems - in all

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - In a prize-winning takeoff of the
classic opening line of bad mystery writing, ``It was a dark and
stormy night,'' high school French teacher Patricia Presutti starts
her Great Novel this way:
   ``The bone-chilling scream split the warm summer night in two,
the first half being before the scream when it was fairly balmy and
calm and pleasant, the second half still balmy and quite pleasant
for those who hadn't heard the scream at all, but not calm or balmy
or even very nice for those who did hear the scream, discounting
the little period of time during the actual scream itself when your
ears might have been hearing it but your brain wasn't reacting yet
to let you know.''
   Presutti's ``thuddingly anticlimactic'' line overcame 20,000
entries Thursday to capture the annual Bulwer-Lytton fiction
contest at San Jose State University, said contest founder Scott
Rice, an English professor.

Subj:   Another Bulwer-Lytton Entry

I don't know if you've read this one or not, but here's last year's
winning entry in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest:

     The countdown had stalled at T-minus-69 seconds when Desiree, the
     first female ape to go up in space, winked at me slyly and pouted
     her thick, rubbery lips unmistakably--the first of many such
     advances during what would prove to be the longest, and most memor-
     able, space voyage of my career.

As he waited nervously in the cabriolet for Gloria to take her leave of the
grieving company in the graveyard, Geoffrey happened to catch a glimpse,
through the steel-grey blur of the driving rain, of the old Faversham mansion,
lowering behind the slowly disintegrating ironwork of a fence that had, in
another time, gloried in the grandeur of which it was a part; but now, the
putrescent aspect of the massive edifice's crumbling masonry, half-buried
under a coat of rotting Swedish ivy, stirred in him a lurking disquiet that
weighed unrestfully upon his mind like a fat man's paunch on an unwilling lap.

Take that and stuff it into Vesuvius, Milord!
