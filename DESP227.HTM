        The only people who can be made the butts of jokes in the
        self-righteous sanctimonious 90s are white southerners and blonde
        women. Since I am the former and am married to the latter, I have
        a little trouble with this concept.  I guess our kind just have a
        little bit better sense of humor than all those groups insisting
        that there couldn't possibly be anything funny about one of them.

        Has it really been decreed and agreed that there shall be no
        jokes?  How about Camille Paglia jokes?

        Somebody asked "Where were you November 22, 1963?"

        I was a newspaper reporter in Chicago, a real cub, but covering
        City Hall for a local wire service.  We had a TV set in the City
        Hall press room.  Our personal cop came by and told us to turn it
        on about two minutes after Kennedy was shot.  My editor made me go
        ask the fire commissioner what he planned to do in the case of
        riots.  That was the only laugh the commissioner and I had that
        day.  Later I called Mayor Daley on his unlisted phone and asked
        him when he'd be down to City Hall.  I went around collecting
        quotes on how bad everybody felt.

        We had a big meeting of the finance committee that afternoon.  Of
        course it was cancelled.  The weird thing was that the city
        council consisted of 44 Democrats, five Republicans and one
        independent.  The independent, Len Despres, was a real thorn in
        the side of the Daley machine.  He was very smart, very honest and
        very diligent.  You can see that would be a problem.  The
        Democrats really hated him, but for some reason they gave him the
        honor of making the motion to adjourn the meeting.  I've always
        wondered about that.

        There was a special meeting of the city council the next day and
        the city  band played the Democratic Party theme song, "Happy Days
        are Here Again" real slow and sad and all the Irish aldermen
        pulled out the oratorical stops.  To hear that red-nosed gang of
        Chicago aldermen doing a high-tension version of their Irish wake
        act was a real wonder.  I wrote a semi-stenographic record  of the
        whole thing for my wire service.  The meeting lasted four hours.

        Most people associate "Hail to the Chief" with that week, but for
        me it's "Happy Days are Here Again".

        I was glad I had work to do.  When I got back to the office I
        knocked out a sidebar on how to display the flag at half-mast.  We
        weren't used to assassinations then and my little piece ran all
        over the country.

A friend of a guy in the Nutrition School at Tufts was one of the
lucky passengers onboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Boston during
our recent hurricane "Bob".  The captain did his best to skirt the
edge of the storm, but it was a pretty rough ride just the same -
rough enough that the flight attendants were ordered to strap
themselves into their seats for about half an hour, and many of the
passengers were putting the little plastic-lined bags in their seat
pockets to good use.  When the turbulence finally abated, the flight
attendants unbuckled themselves, and the captain's voice came on over
the intercom.

"Well, folks, that was quite some ride, wasn't it?!  But we came
through it fine, just the way we always do, and I'm happy to report
that it looks like the remainder of our trip should be much calmer.
On behalf of myself and today's flight crew, I'd like to thank you
very much for your calmness and cooperation, and extend our best
wishes for a pleasant stay in Boston.

        .

Jesus Christ - whadda bitchin' ride!!  Boy - I sure could use a cup of
good strong coffee and a b2w j1b, right about now!"

As a stricken stewardess dashed up the aisle to the cabin to inform
the captain that his intercom was still on, one of the passengers
called after her, "Don't forget the coffee!"

Al,

Feel free to post the following on EZNET.  In all my years of programming
EEC's I don't remember anybody named John Warton.

                                        Jack

        "Everything's in Augat sockets now,"

Ford has never used Auguat socket for any **PRODUCTION** modules. We do use
them all the time for development !!

        "Nah, EEC-1 and -2 used discrete parts,"

Wrong,  EEC-I and II (Ford always used Roman numerals on EEC versions, except
in Australia) actually used a 12 bit custom microprocessor designed and
manufactured by Toshiba.  I don't remember exactly how many chips there were
in the box, something like 4 or 5 (CPU, ROM, I/O, A/D, etc.), but to my
knowledge, it was the only micro at that time (1977) that had multiply and
divide instructions.

Ford did, at that time, also have a pilot program only in California using an
analog control system with discreete parts.  It was called ECU-A and B.

        "EEC-3 was the first with a microprocessor ... it had an
         off-the-shelf 8048."

Wrong again !  The EEC-III used a custom made 8 bit micro from Motorola.  This
part never saw the light of day commercially and very few people in Motorola
ever heard of the 67002 !

However, Ford did have another engine controller out at that time based on the
8048, and it was called MCU.  MCU came in several flavor (-A, -B, -C, -D) and
was sold to American Motors (including Jeep) and was actually in production
until a few years ago.  MCU only did "feedback carburetor" control.  EEC-III
did "central fuel injection" (CFI), ignition, EGR and a couple of other
things.

        "EEC-4 was much better ...Now there was an engine computer.
         Sixteen-bit CPU, fuel injection, timing, spark advance ...
         Boy, that EEC-4 could do anything!"

True, but as you see it started off as a direct replacement for EEC-III.
Recently we have added transmission controls.

        "Intel designed its CPU just for engine control. Later they
         repackaged it called it the 8096. Still sells pretty well, too."

True !  The Ford version is called an 8061.  The 8096 is being used by several
other automotive vendors for various different functions.

        "Yeah, it was EEC-4 that really sold me on Intel,"

Well, it hasn't sold too many others.  GM and Chrysler use Motorola based
engine controls and Ford has announced that they will change to a Motorola
RISC design in the late 1990's.

Subj:   What I did on my vacation

Tom-

This all seemed much more interesting before I wrote it, but
your Desperado readers (or is that Desporadim?) might enjoy...

-Dave Fonseca

I just took two weeks off and drove from Boston to Minneapolis Minnesota
(known as Mpls to the locals.)  Having spent most of my life in the
North East, I always enjoy traveling elsewhere in the US, mainly because
you can start up conversations with complete strangers at the
check-out counter without making them feel for their wallet.

Speaking of check-out counters, can you believe the grocery store my
mother-in-law shops at still has bag-boys who insist on wheeling
your purchases out to the car for you!  (Sorry I'd have used the
gender neutral term bag-person, but that is already the gender neutral
term for homeless folks, and bag-children somehow doesn't cut it,
and then we have bag-man which usually implies a get-away car...)

Along the way, my wife and I saw several funny signs &amp; bumperstickers.
One pleasant looking motel in the Michigan Upper Peninsula (UP) was
sporting a slogan on its sign-board which brought understatement and
modesty in advertising to new levels:

                Nice Here

Either that or most of their letters had blown away, and from those left,
this was all that could be spelled!

Several slogans were religiously oriented:

                Know Jesus/ Know Peace/ No Jesus/ No Peace

                Just say no to sex with pro-lifers

One T-shirt my wife &amp; I saw in an amusement park had a message which
seemed strangely ambiguous:

        Front has gory drawing of Jesus being crucified
        Words: If I'm OK and you're OK, then explain this

        Back reads:
        His righteousness rightously requires that he require
        his required righteousness that he requires.

I probably didn't get that right, but you get the idea.
You wouldn't believe how hard that is to read when spelled out in
6 lines on the back of a moving T-shirt!

I was initially left with the impression that this guy was not
too happy with Christianity, but after some discussion, and seeing
a second shirt that day, my wife convinced me that this fellow
was probably a strong-minded Christian.  In any case, he must have felt
strongly one way or another!

Another shirt which really didn't seem appropriate in the Kiddie-land
area where I noticed it was entitled:

        S4ize Hussein!

Of course a bent over carIcature of S3m Hussein is shown with a missile
firmly inserted.

With 60 odd hours of driving and 175 gallons of gasoline converted into
water and pollution, I made the usual observations of anyone returning
to Massachusetts: People around here drive like Hell!  Now don't get me
wrong, I'm talking about speed not manners.  As soon as we got on the
Mass. Turnpike, I needed to be doing 70 to 75 MPH to stay in the
far left lane.

This rate was only beat by folks driving the Canadian Trans-Continental
highway north of Lake Huron. glorified 2-lane highway.  Several times
there I found the speedometer touching 90 after passing a passel of
traffic.  Stupid of me, but somehow when I get in to a foreign country,
my right shoe suddenly gains 10 pounds.  Later in Minnesota, my father-in-law
helped me add several carriage bolts to firm up the car-top carrier I'd
attached to two 2X4 cross-pieces.

Driving 'Out West' made me realize why American cars are the way they
are.  All the roads in the Michigan UP were straight.  If I were a
teenager out there, no wonder I would aspire to an American muscle
car.  Who the heck cares whether the darn thing can turn?  You only do that
in town at stop-lights.  If you are hot-rodding, you point it down
the road, floor it and wait for the speedometer to stop moving!

I had mentioned earlier that I liked the mid-western friendliness,
well, it turned out to be quite profitable for me.  On Manitoulin
Island in the middle of Lake Huron, I started chatting with another
tourist in a restaurant, ended up he worked for Kodak, when he
found out that I'd brought my camera along and hadn't used several
of Kodak's more exotic print films, he gave me a couple of rolls!

Later I would start chatting with another guy in the campground shower,
he was responsible for selling advertising in a campground guide
to campgrounds in Wisconsin.  He gave me a copy of the guide.
Having this in hand did not make my wife any happier when I got back from my
'quick shower'  over an hour later.

This campground looked like a place that Steven King would
have used in one of his novels.  What we found was a ghost town of
hundreds and hundreds of campers permanently parked cheek by jowl
under a canopy of an artificially planted pine forest.  Dark, no flowers,
no grass (astro-turf instead), lots of bad lawn ornaments, and
beer-drinking &amp; liquor signs.  Some of the trailers looked like they
hadn't been lived in for years, but before that they had been added
to and glued together in some imaginative &amp; bizarre ways.

Luckily my family was banished to the 'primitive camping' area where
we had acres and acres of space to ourselves and our tents.  I am sure I
just don't fully appreciate some of the finer nuances of 'RV' living.
My wife almost had me convinced that come weekends this place turned into a
veritable Sodom &amp; Gomorah, with all sorts of drinking and fornication spilling
from one trailer to the next.  (Boy does that make us sound straight!)

This campground was near to Osh Kosh, Wisconsin, birthplace of the
Republican party, and home to both the famous over-all manufacturer
and the Experimental Aircraft Association.  One week a year this little
town is home to the busiest airport in the world as owners of home-built
airplanes flock to this mecca of flying...( Boy maybe I should take up
writing tourist brochures huh?)

Unfortunately I missed the fly-in by several weeks, but they have just
built a great museum in town loaded with lots of beautifully cared for
airplanes.  One disappointment: their gift shop is full of models
and advertisements for America's array of flying tax-gobbling military might.
I asked the woman at the counter if they had any 'stuff' featuring the
ultimate home-built of this half of the century: the Voyager airplane.
One somewhat cheesey looking postcard was all.

This side-trip had been partially as a result of reading Dick Rutan and
Jeana Yeager's account of their around the world trip, "Voyager" is the name
of the book.  I was glued to my seat while reading this great story.
Although the original voyager aircraft went to the Smithsonian, the
EAA museum has a mock-up of the cockpit area of the plane, including what
I believe are all of the original handwritten checklists still taped
to the instruments.  Since the Smithsonian plane is hanging, this
exhibit a better way to see how tiny the cockpit was.

The press coverage during the flight failed to dig up all of the details
on why this flight was such a dangerous long-shot.  Somebody in Hollywood
should wake up and buy the story!

The other big-time tourist attraction we went to was Cedar Point amusement
park in Sandusky Ohio.  Ten roller coasters, two world record sized ones,
one metal, one wood.  If you go, pick an overcast day, and bring your own
food.  The lines were very long, as this was a gorgeous day after two rainy
days.  We waited an hour and a half for the ride on the wooden roller coaster.
Well worth it.  My wife kept her eyes closed through the whole ride on the
world record sized metal coaster.

The wooden coaster structure was beautiful, it somehow reminded me of the
Roman coliseum.  The base under the highest rise was easily 200 yards wide,
The structure is incredibly massive and yet delicate at the same time.
As this is the first year it has been open, the wood has not weathered yet,
so at a distance, it almost looks like it is made of matchsticks.

The park also has a water section, with at least nine waterslides,
including 2 which make you feel like you are getting airborne over
several drops.  This is the closest I have ever felt to the thrill of
luging, of course it is probably 4 times slower, takes no skill, and
you can't get hurt.

                          US Civil War Revisited

    The US National Park service is developing a computerized
    directory that lists the names of 3.5 million soldiers who fought
    in the US Civil War. Visitors to one of the 28 Civil War sites
    operated by the NPS will soon be able to ascertain if their
    ancestors were Yankees or Rebels. The system is expected to
    provide the names, home states, and ranks of the soldiers along
    with data on the 7,000 war regiments and many of the 10,500
    battles. The data will be input by members of the Federation of
    Genealogical Societies and the Genealogical Societies of Utah.

        Which side was my family on?  My four grandparents were from
        Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and Massachusetts.  Family legend
        has it that an ancestor on the Massahusetts side opined that the
        Southern states were entitled to withdraw from the Union and was
        dragged to the front of the church and forced to kiss the American
        flag.  In the meantime, one of the Mississippi breed was in
        approximately the same fix, having uttered the thought that a deal
        was a deal and the Union should not be dissolved.  Thus, my
        contrary genes.

Subj:   A poem for these times...

Hi,

For your enjoyment...it's not my creation, though I wish it were.  I don't
know who wrote it.  It's fairly obvious who the author was influenced by...

Mike
--
        At my terminal I sat typing,
        Trying hard to fight off napping.
        When there came a slight, soft rapping,
        Rapping on my office door,
        Only that and nothing more.

                Then I sat up, startled, freaking
                Just to hear a voice a-speaking
                "Your presence now I am a-seeking,
                Seeking on the lobby floor,
                Bring your badge and nothing more"

        What is this I'm a-hearing?
        Is it the news that I've been fearing?
        Now my desk they'll soon be clearing,
        Clearing posters off my door,
        Varnished wood and nothing more.

                I bolted upright, staggered, straining
                From my head the blood a-draining
                See the hurt and shock I'm feigning
                Feigning hurt and loss galore
                Pure BS and nothing more

        Now the bloody axe is falling
        Now the perpetrator stalling
        "Personnel may soon be calling,
        Call you to another chore"
        I think, "Right pal, nevermore"

                In my beach chair I'm a-napping
                Now my consciousness is sapping
                By the soothing steady lapping,
                Lapping waves upon the shore
                Just this beer, then one more...

                          (A Poem)
                for Allen Ginsberg

I saw the best minds of my generation,
at least I think that's who it was,
timidly pushing their parents toward age, &amp; their
        parents pushed back while classic hits played
        more music less talk, talk, talk,
I say talking 'bout my g-g-g-generation,
not my, my, my, my generation, baby, the one
        that celebrates itself on Thirtysomething,
        hope I die before I get old, now fortysomething
        and still grasping back at youth, feelin' groovy
        quality time,
but my generation,
who had rebellion ready made if they wanted
        to cop Mick Jagger's adolescent attitude
        to a vanished authority,
but who called the 60's mere anarchy instead,
        or would have if they knew Yeats,
who finished high school in quiet desperation
        and were driven cringing to college,
        hoping to escape welfare or middle America,
        depending on where they grew up, &amp; didn't
        read Yeats,
but who found that a post-modern revisionist
        academia steeped in western culture
        from Warhol to Woodstock had left nothing
        of value to deconstruct &amp; invent themselves,
who were never asked what they could do
        for their country besides consume &amp; buy
        American, which, coincidentally, was also
        what their country could do for them,
but who anyhow knew that freedom isn't free
        and wondering, some of them, what the hell
        it was then, went to Panama &amp; Iraq &amp; didn't
        die enough to start a protest,
who, sophisticated, knew the importance of self
        esteem, &amp; thought they were okay &amp; didn't
        need therapists,
but who still smoked cigarettes &amp; didn't use
        condoms &amp; were minors in possession of
        alcohol, &amp; bugged their parents with sheer
        stupidity because they couldn't think of
        anything better, &amp; sometimes died of that,
        but still not enough to start a protest,
who had no, damn, tried to have no illusions
        and knew they'd have to pay back the
        national debt,
but who waited tables for 3 years after
        graduation &amp; tried to pay just college
        loans instead,
who knew they could fuck the establishment
        just by not buying,
but who read something out loud one night &amp;
        almost cried, and thought perhaps they'd
        start a protest,
or a committee if anybody else felt the
        same way
exactly, but who, exactly, who ya gonna call?
if someone, turning toward The Wonder Years
        should say
that wasn't it
no, that wasn't it at all.

        Steve cannot respond to your mail right now. He has been kidnapped by
space aliens and is being held on the planet Bmnifyl until our demands are
met.  Although far too complex for mere humans to comprehend, the knowledge
Steve has acquired by porting &lt;xxx&gt; to &lt;yyy&gt; makes him invaluable throughout
the galaxy.  Steve suggested that we use these primitive means to convey our
message to other Earthlings. Steve is being well-treated. We probed his
subconscious, his innermost fantasies, to find the ideal setting for Steve
while we await the Earth response to our demands. Although some of Steve's
fantasies were beyond our means to provide (and in some cases, to understand),
he seems quite content in his new setting.
        Steve asked that we inform other Earthlings to contact &lt;zzz&gt; regarding
issues having to do with the &lt;aaa&gt; project.  Contact &lt;bbb&gt; or &lt;ccc&gt; for other
emergencies.  Contact &lt;ddd&gt; for membership to &lt;eee&gt;.
        If the following 10 demands are met, Steve will be returned to his
office on Tuesday, September 3rd unharmed and well-rested. Otherwise, Steve's
knowledge will be used to improve the lives of billions of lifeforms
throughout the galaxy, all worshiping the ground he walks on, his every whim
and fancy turned immediately into reality. You see, simple Earthlings, we
can't lose. You have no chance against our superior intelligence. (By the way,
Steve wanted to add a few demands of his own to the list which we, of course,
denied).

        Demands:

1. Elvis will be returned to us immediately!
2. Whoever has been mutilating cattle and making crop circles, cut it out!
   We don't think it's funny anymore!
3. Immediately start rebroadcasting "Lost in Space." It was our favorite
   T.V. show.
4. The staff of the Weekly World News will report back to the planet Bmnifyl
   right away for violating the prime directive.
5. Everyone will immediately standardize on the VMS operating system, the
   obvious choice of beings with higher intelligence, and stop using all those
   other silly operating systems which have the entire rest of the galaxy
   laughing behind your backs.
6. Each and every Earthling will consume hotdogs, baked beans, bananas, and
   beer for one week while we conduct atmospheric studies on CO2 levels to
   determine the validity of your so-called greenhouse effect and to
   potentially take corrective measures (and don't think we won't enjoy
   conducting this experiment).
7. You will decriminalize the following drugs immediately:
   ...Wait a minute, what was I talking about?
8. Dan Quayle will be given unconditional decision-making authority for NASA
   and the U.S. space program.
9. Lighten up! You Earthlings take things way too seriously. Galactic
   comedians are constantly poking fun at and imitating Earthlings:

                [ With a straight face...]

        Q: How many Earthlings does it take to change a gravitron belt?
        A: One.

                [ Roars of laughter rattle the space continuum ]

10. All so-called Yuppies will be rounded up in camps for our future
    consumption (just provide them with baked brie, some wine, and a Wall
    Street Journal to keep them entertained). We find these are the only
    humans we can bring ourselves to eat.

&gt;From THE ECONOMIST

Nor were the "secrets" the hackers encountered as scintillating as the
press supposed.  Asked to look over the list of software purchased by the
KGB, one American security expert concluded: "The Russians were rooked."
The KGB paid several thousand dollars for a word processor, called GNU
Emacs, which is widely distributed free in western universities.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        The preciousness of this moment at the Free Software Foundation,
        home of GNU EMACS. was probably somewhat tempered by hearing their
        elaborate programmer's toolkit described as "a word processor".

        Another precious Free Software moment for me was hearing Richard
        Stallman trying to explain the idea of a recursive acronym to an
        NPR reporter a few months back.

In early January, before operation Desert Shield turned into Operation
Desert Storm, pentagon officials hunkered down late into the night feasting
on Domino's Pizza.  Now we read that Boris and his friends kept Pizza Hut
delivering during the recent putsch.  I'll bet Domino's did more business,
but then again, Pizza Hut probably had no competition.  I wonder if Papa
Gino's, Chuck E.  Cheese, Shakey's and a host of other pizza chains are
kicking themselves right now for not expanding into the right markets.

Subj:   RE: Bill Veeck (Desperado)

    My favorite Veeck promo was 25" beer night.  The fights in the
    bleachers at Comisky were said to be legendary.  This was in the
    early 80's, so inflation doesn't have all that much affect on the
    price.

    Alas, even the cheap beer didn't help, and Veeck was forced to
    sell the White Sox sometime around 1982.  He retired to the
    bleachers at Wrigley field, shirtless in the sunshine, beer in
    hand, at many a home game.  Even in his 70's (80's?) his love of
    the game was purely boyish.  Great to see him inducted into the
    hall of fame in this era of baseball as big business.

    He sold to a pair of guys called Einsdorf and Reinhorn (Einshorn
    and Reinsdorf???) who promptly discontinued 25" beer night and
    tried to attract a family crowd.  They kept the scoreboard,
    though.  I remember one foggy, windless night at Comisky after
    they had taken over.  After one measly Sox home run, they went
    berserk with the fireworks.  The smoke just kind of sunk down
    onto the field and stayed there.  They had to halt the game for
    about fifteen minutes before the smoke cleared.  Veeck's
    revenge?

    Also, about junior high and mimeo machines.  Going through some
    of my old stuff at my folks home recently, I came across a copy
    of an underground newspaper I helped publish at my junior high.
    The paper was called: Yer Analysis.  This was, of course, in the
    60's.  The hot issue of the day was a rebellion brewing to relax
    the dress code to permit the wearing of blue jeans.  Several
    students had been suspended for wearing denim armbands to
    school.  This issue featured a transcript of a meeting with
    several of the rebels and Mr. Omara, the principle.  This was
    followed by a cute article about the dangers of a new drug
    called Omarajuana, which causes users to come hopelessly
    confused, to beat around the bush, etc.  Oh gee, I could
    reminisce all day with stories about the feared assistant
    principal, Mr. Guter, who among other things kept a jar of axle
    grease in his office which he applied to any boy's hair he
    deemed was too long.  But, it's time to get back to work.

        I guess my favorite Veeckery was the shower in the left field
        stands, or maybe the snack bar snuggled in the fence along the right
        field line at ground level. or putting Satchel Paige in the Big
        Show, or . . .

        Speaking of high school, I read a piece somewhere recently that
        pointed out that all the so-called movers and shakers in
        Washington were probably presidents of their high school class.

Subj:   Desperado contribution, old statues of Lenin

Article 829 of clari.news.interest.quirks:

        LONDON (UPI) -- Soviet towns and republics think they have found a
hitherto untapped source of revenue -- unwanted statues of Vladimir Lenin
-- but demand may be a problem.
        Christie's auction house in London said Tuesday talks were continuing
on two 30-foot bronze statues of the founding father of the Soviet
Union.
        A Christie's spokeswoman said the auction house was initially
``casually approached'' by Soviet Communist Party officials who offered
the statues for sale.
        Christie's declined to identify the town or republic where the
statues were to come from in order to spare the owners any
embarrassment, but said the two sides were discussing details of a
possible sale, including the cost of transporting the huge figures to
London.
        There is concern Christie's auctioneers may have trouble finding
someone to buy one of the big statues.
        ``I don't think we could use them,'' said a British Communist Party
spokesman. ``They wouldn't fit in our office.''
        But others are more optimistic the statues can be sold in what would
be a great ideological irony.
        ``There's almost always a market -- that's the premise of capitalism
as we know it,'' said Niri Sahakian, artistic adviser for London's New
Acadamy Gallery for contemporary artwork. ``But it's not exactly a
limited edition piece, is it?''

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        As if that weren't enough, the Russian Republic is proposing to
        auction off Lenin's corpse, long a major tourist attraction in
        Red Square, to raise money.  They think they can get $17 million
        for it.  They wouldn't get that much from me.  Divide that figure
        by 100,000,000 to arrive at my bid.

        One reason they need to raise money is that the rouble isn't
        really money, it's sort of a bookkeeping deal with no exchange
        value whatsoever.  Nil.

        As part of its independence planning, the Ukraine Republic is
        printing up its own currency.  The unit?  The Ukraine dollar.
        Some left-winger somewhere is gritting his greenish teeth over
        that one.

        Some right-winger caught James Reston putting ironic "quotes"
        around the expression "evil empire" the other day.  Granting that
        it is a melodramatic phrase, does James Reston, or anyone else,
        not *now* know that it was an evil empire, one that may not yet be
        exactly out of action?  The most annoying thing about the Reagan
        posture on the USSR is the pretense that his policies somehow
        toppled the Soviet Union.

        A:  His policies were completely in line with forty-plus years of
        unremitting USA hostility to the CCCP, from Democrats and Republicans
        alike.

        B: Reagan's policies were based on the premise that the Russian
        Bear was 4.3 times more powerful than the American Eagle and
        poised to spring at any moment, which was ridiculous then and
        patently ridiculous now.

        C: SDI was/is an unusually stupid idea:  a real-time system using
        artificial intelligence, hung up in the sky around the entire
        planet, and never to be tested until it was needed.  And, in the
        meantime, cut back on the boring, expensive parts of the defense
        system, because they'll no longer be needed.  You know, soldiers,
        sailors, airmen.

        D. James Reston is utterly without influence and his phrases and
        opinions don't make no nevermind with nobody.  And the Reagon
        iconographers and hagiographers make more of the same.

        Ideology just doesn't pay.  It doesn't pay.  We don't get our
        money's worth from it.  It's still nothing but a particularly
        elaborate form of stupidity.  It has to be elaborate to satisfy
        the urges of intelligent people.

        Yeah, yeah, I'm a liberal, sure, but it's a drag a lot of the
        time.  Which is why I get so cranky.

&gt;From "The Tonight Show Staring Johnny Carson"
(C) 1991 Carson Productions, Inc.

A tribute from Johnny Carson to all the Soviet republics
seeking freedom ("The Battle Hymn of the Republic" playing
softly in the background).

              "What Democracy Means to Me"
                   by Johnny Carson

To me, democracy means placing trust in the little guy,
giving the fruits of nationhood to those who built the
nation.  Democracy means anyone can grow up to be president,
and anyone who doesn't grow up can be vice president.

Democracy is people of all races, colors, and creeds united
by a single dream: to get rich and move to the suburbs away
from people of all races, colors, and creeds.  Democracy is
having time set aside to worship--18 years if you're Jim
Bakker.

Democracy is buying a big house you can't afford with money
you don't have to impress people you wish were dead. And,
unlike communism, democracy does not mean having just one
ineffective political party; it means having two ineffective
political parties.

Democracy means freedom of sexual choice between any two
consenting adults; Utopia means freedom of choice between
three or more consenting adults. But I digress. Democracy is
welcoming people from other lands, and giving them something
to hold onto--usually a mop or a leaf blower.  It means that
with proper timing and scrupulous bookkeeping, anyone can
die owing the government a huge amount of money.

Democracy means a thriving heartland with rolling fields of
Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Spanky, and Wheezer.  Democracy means
our elected officials bow to the will of the people, but
more often they bow to the big butts of campaign
contributors.

Yes, democracy means fighting every day for what you
deserve, and fighting even harder to keep other weaker
people from getting what they deserve.  Democracy means
never having the Secret Police show up at your door.  Of
course, it also means never having the cable guy show up at
your door.  It's a tradeoff.  Democracy means free
television, not good television, but free.

Democracy is being able to pick up the phone and, within a
minute, be talking to anyone in the country, and, within two
minutes, be interrupted by call waiting.

Democracy means no taxation without representation, and god
knows, we've just about had the hell represented out of us.
It means the freedom to bear arms so you can blow the "o"
out of any rural stop sign you want.

And finally, democracy is the eagle on the back of a dollar
bill, with 13 arrows in one claw, 13 leaves on a branch, 13
tail feathers, and 13 stars over its head--this signifies
that when the white man came to this country, it was bad
luck for the Indians, bad luck for the trees, bad luck for
the wildlife, and lights out for the American eagle.

I thank you.

                                FAULT TOLERANT

    TANDEM - It was the software bug felt 'round the world.
       As the earth turned on Aug. 27, a unique combination of numbers
       generated by Tandem's "time stamp" facility threatened to stop
       hundreds of Tandem's fault-tolerant computers at precisely 4:22 p.m.
       in each local time zone.
       Starting in Asia and continuing on to Europe, the appointed hour of
       doom arrived, precipitating system shutdowns.
       The culprit was a faulty piece of software code embedded in the
       Tandem Safeguard security system that interpreted the date and time
       numbers as an impossible command.  Affected systems tumbled into an
       endless loop that tied up all computer resources and eluded attempts
       to fix the problem.
       "The time stamp took on a numerical value that would trigger
       incorrect computer logic," one West Coast Tandem user explained.
       "The security package would then lock up the system.  It wouldn't
       permit anyone to log on, even people who were trying to fix the
       problem."  The only way to fix the problem, once it began, was to
       take the affected computers off-line before restarting them.
       Shutdowns were only prevented by disabling the security system
       between 4:22 p.m. on Aug. 27 and 5 p.m. on Aug. 28.
       This harrowing brush with worldwide hardware failures was averted at
       most U.S. sites after Tandem field engineers warned users in
       last-minute phone calls.
       Only 60 sites worldwide felt the sting of the bug's bite, said a
       Tandem spokesman, who asserted that Tandem's fault-tolerant design
       came through after all, retaining data on affected machines.
       The computers that felt the bug were Tandem VLX and Tandem Cyclone
       systems running the new C 20.2 release of the Safeguard security
       package, along with Tandem's Guardian operating system.
       If a permanent software fix is not made, the same problem will recur
       in 18 months, according to sources.
       Some sources also said they expected Tandem to announce a fix later
       this fall.

Subj:   Typo shuts down telephone service!

 DSC Communications - Phone outages expected to be tied to typing mistake
        {The Wall Street Journal, 25-Nov-91, p. B4}
   A final report that may be presented to the Federal Communications
 Commission this week is expected to conclude that a mistyped character in
 software from DSC Communications Corp. resulted in several local-telephone
 service outages last summer. The report, compiled by Bell Communications
 Research Corp., also will show that the software didn't cause the failures
 alone. Faulty data, failure of computer clocks and other triggers led to a
 chain of events that caused the outages, according to the Dallas Morning News,
 which said it obtained a copy of the report. The newspaper said the report
 will conclude that none of the "trigger" events were caused by computer
 hackers. The disclosure echoes testimony before Congress last July, in which
 DSC officials admitted that three bits of information in a huge computer
 program were incorrect, omitting computational procedures that would have
 stopped DSC's signaling system from becoming congested with messages. A
 spokesman for DSC, which makes the signal transfer point that carries signals
 to set up a call, but not the call itself, confirmed that a "6" in a line of
 computer code should actually have been a "D." That one error caused the
 equipment and software to fail under an avalanche of computer-generated
 messages. The error was in an April software modification for the signal
 transfer point systems. The spokesman said the company won't distribute final
 copies of the report until Bellcore, as the research consortium of the Baby
 Bells is known, presents a copy to the FCC and a congressional
 telecommunications committee, possibly this week.

&gt;From rec.humor.funny:

A true story, from someone who was there at the time, circa 1980.

It seems that our favorite telephone company had a terrible problem:
employees were pilfering office supplies for their children. In par-
ticular, three-hole loose-leaf binder paper. It was decreed by the
powers that be that this sort of waste was unacceptable, and a long-
forgotten bureaucrat was assigned the task of discouraging theft of
three-hole paper.

The bureaucrat's solution was simple: the company would now use *four*-
hole paper, with the holes drilled differently so as to be incompatible
with the typical school-child's binder. Four-hole loose-leaf paper was
ordered, along with proper four-ring binders; new manuals, documentation,
and other papers were likewise printed on four-hole paper, so all binders
and paper would be happy and consistent throughout the company.

The result was, naturally, that employees stole both the binders *and*
the paper.

Since the company was now suffering larger losses than before, it was
decreed that the they would return to traditional three-hole paper and
binders. But there was the problem of an existing large inventory of
four-ring binders. Hence, with truly Solomonic wisdom, it was further
decreed that all new paper would have *seven* holes, and would thus be
both upward and downward binder-compatible. And, to this day, 8+1/2 by
11 documents from our favorite telephone company still have 7 holes in
them.

All of which nicely demonstrates that System V Release 1 and System V
Release 4 were not a fluke.

&lt;csg&gt;

[For the benefit of those not UNIX-literate: System V Release 1 ignored
BSD UNIX and really hoped it would go away. System V Release 4 wants to
be compatible with every UNIX in existence.]

    Also, I discovered something interesting today!  If you move both hands
    one key to the right, and attempt to type "core" (as in core dump), you
    get:  "vptr" (!).  I always wondered where they got that name.... (:-)).
