the rest of the world, and, in particular, how to communicate with the
ARPAnet.

Subject: It's a small, small world

Networks...

Many of you may know that the ENET now has over 1600 nodes...
(and it's growing by an average of about ten nodes per week)

But that's not the full extent of the reachable world.  We have
connections of various types to a few other networks:

1. ARPANET (and other networks connected to it by the INTERNET protocol)
   This network is a lot like DECNET, i.e., it can be used not only for
   sending mail and files around, but also for creating real-time con-
   nections between cooperating programs.  ARPANET is operated by the
   Defense Department Advanced Reasearch Projects Agency and intercon-
   nects, via the INTERNET protocol with MILNET (the military side of
   ARPAnet) and several networks at universities and major corporations.
   With a little bit of work (which might get done for Phase V), DECNET
   could run the INTERNET protocol.

2. USENET (a loose collection of Unix (mostly) systems)
   This network is really not a network.  It is used for sending mail
   and for sending files.  A connection in this network is done by
   dialing (usually) into a terminal port on another system, logging
   in as an interactive user, and then activating a file transfer
   program.  Mail is a special format file.

3. Public Packet Networks (X.25)
   These are transport mechanisms which can be used by any network
   type as a transport layer or for direct program-to-program commun-
   ication.  Some of the links within the ENET are X.25 links (which
   means that each bit transferred over the link costs money) -- this
   is known as data-link mapping (the data link is mapped into a DECNET
   link).  When this is the case, you can't tell that X.25 is involved.
   There is also a version of MAIL available allowing you to specify a
   DTE number (the logical equivalent of a telephone number) instead of
   a node name.  This version of mail then establishes an X.25 call to
   another VMS system which must be running the same version of MAIL,
   and delivers mail using the mail protocol.  We haven't released this
   outside the company yet, but we may do this, and/or incorporate it
   into the Message Router, allowing Mail to be sent anywhere, using
   National Bureau of Standards or ISO Mail protocols.

Now, you ask, how do I use this?

1. ARPANET (and the rest of Internet) is connected to DEC via a TOPS-20
   system in Marlboro.  This system, however, does not presently oper-
   ate as an automatic mail gateway -- our gateway is on node RHEA in
   Palo Alto.  The gateway actually is into the USENET, and this gateway
   uses one of two machines, one at Stanford and the other at Berkeley,
   to forward messages into the ARPAnet.

   To send to someone on the ARPAnet, you should specify the address
   as follows:

        RHEA::DECWRL::"covert@mit-mc.ARPA"

   This will send to user Covert at the MIT PDP-10 MIT-MC.

   RSX nodes can make the following kind of definition in their MAILNODE
   file for commonly used nodes:

        MIT-MC RHEA::DECWRL::"&lt;&gt;@mit-mc.ARPA"

   which permits sending to MIT-MC::COVERT.  We also have ARPA defined
   on our nodes as ARPA RHEA::DECWRL::"&lt;&gt;.ARPA" which permits sending
   to any node as ARPA::user@node.  VMS does not yet have this kind of
   translation capability.

   Many INTERNET nodes have gateways into other networks.  For example,
   there is a DECNET network linking Columbia University, Case-Western
   Reserve University, and Carnegie-Mellon.  I can send to CMCCTD::USER
   and have it translated to RHEA::DECWRL::"USER%CMCCTD@CUCS20.ARPA".

   This message reaches the user by travelling on our network to Palo
   Alto, entering the ARPA net at either Stanford or Berkeley, traversing
   the ARPA net to Columbia University in Manhattan, and then travelling
   as a TOPS-20 mail message over DECNET back to Pittsburgh.

   Many INTERNET users can reply to us as well.  Whether it works or
   not will depend primarily on the Mail program at their site.  Mail
   to us should be addressed as follows:

        "decwrl!rhea!enetnode!user"@BERKELEY  (or @SU-SHASTA).

   The Berkeley mailer seems to be more tolerant of the way many mailers
   format messages than the Stanford mailer.

   *********************************************************************
   AN IMPORTANT WARNING:  The ARPAnet is operated by BB&amp;N under contract
   to the Defense Communications Agency.  Don't do anything stupid, or
   we could lose our connection, and you could be in a heap of trouble.
   *********************************************************************

2. USENET doesn't have the kind of automatic routing that DECNET and
   INTERNET have.  Each USENET site agrees to call various nodes from
   time to time and transmit mail.  There's sort of a gentleman's
   agreement that I'll pay for the phone costs to transmit your mes-
   sages if you'll pay the costs to transmit mine.

   To send to someone on USENET you have to know the path to take to
   reach him.  There are certain key nodes which most people know how
   to reach.  UCBVAX (the USENET name for the ARPA node BERKELEY),
   DECVAX (in Merrimack) and DECWRL are among the key nodes, so you
   should always find the shortest path to/from one of these.

   For example, to send to someone on the machine yale-comix, you
   address your message:  RHEA::DECWRL::"decvax!yale-comix!user".
   A user on yale-comix addresses you as decvax!decwrl!rhea!enetnode!user.

   In correspondence you can specify your address as:

        {ucbvax,decvax}!decwrl!rhea!enetnode!user

   This is the syntax used to tell people that they should send to either
   ucbvax or decvax, then decwrl, etc.

3. Public Packet Networks can be reached by X.25 interfaces on various
   nodes.  Since the owners of those nodes are paying for any usage,
   I won't list any of them here -- you should find them and discuss
   your usage requirements.  This is only marginally useful now, since
   most sites that this could be used to are on (or are about to be on)
   the ENET anyway.  But it will be more useful in the future.

   You send out by sending to the node which has the X.25 circuit,
   followed by the DTE address of the destination node or gateway,
   and then an address with respect to that gateway.  As a totally
   hypothetical example, assume that there were a gateway on node
   PORTAL, and that you wanted to send to a user on node XYZZY in
   the network reachable by DTE address 1234567790.

   You send to PORTAL::1234567890::XYZZY::user.  He replies (assuming
   his gateway is on node TELCOM and your DTE address is 9876543210)
   by sending to TELCOM::9876543210::YOURND::YOU.

Subject: Chased around the world by a stream of bits.

Just got back from travelling around the net.

Almost three weeks ago, as I was packing my bags, the familiar
beeps of a few new mail messages called to me from the terminal
connecter via DTN into the Enet.

The first was a message from a friend on the MILnet at SAC in Omaha
wishing me a good trip and telling me that his secretary was envious
of my travel plans after reading the copy of my itinerary I'd sent
him over the net.

The second was from a friend at Apollo, sent to me over the Usenet.
We had been doing some timing experiments to see how long it took
to get messages back and forth through the Usenet, which stores
messages at intermediate hops.

The third was from one of the people I'd be meeting at Telecom 83
the next day, using a node on the local area net in our booth at the
show connected via the Swiss PTT's packet net into our net.

After making arrangements to meet him at our booth the next day, I
routed my mail to the DBN node I would be using to access the net
for the week in Geneva.

One of the exhibitors at the show, MCI, is expanding their network
to be a world-wide network.  They've also bought WUI (the inter-
national part of Western Union) and are getting into the data network
business.  I used a line in their network to access my MCI mail account.
Later, I would use a modem on a machine back home in our network,
reached via "Set Host" to dial out into AT&amp;T's 800 Service network
to access MCI Mail.

At the end of the week in Geneva I had CASTOR reroute my mail to
the node in the Easinet I would be using during my week in Munich.
The DBN node had no mail forwarding services, so while I was in
Munich I occasionally received messages on the DBN node.  But using
the net, I was still able to read them.

I was in Munich to study the requirements for connecting to the
German public circuit switched data network.  Fortunately, we seem
to do a good job of meeting these requirements.  We'll probably
use circuits in this network to connect demo machines at DECUS into
the net.

At the end of that week, I moved my mail reception point to an Enet
node at DECeast.  Here I was meeting with the people who will be
responsible for adapting TMS to European telephone networks.  One
of the problems here is that telephone dials don't always send the
same number of pulses for the same digit.  The Norwegian network uses
two methods within the same country; they have to translate between
switching machines inside and outside Oslo.

I needed the details, and got them over the phone, but wasn't sure
I'd gotten the right answer, since the person I talked to in Norway
was absolutely flabbergasted by my request, but after thinking about
it realized that there was something different about the phones.

Fortunately I received confirmation from someone in the Norwegian
Telecom Administration, who sent me net mail from a VAX running Unix
at the NTA research center via the Arpanet.

It's a wonderful net, folks.  Using it, you can be at home away from
home.  I responded to most of my mail the same day I received it.
Some of my correspondents didn't even realize they were communicating
with someone who was 5000 miles away.  This interconnection of all
our networks will proceed even further over the next few years.

E Pluribus Unum.  Now I'm back home on my node in the Enet.

Subject: Big Brother and Block Modeling, Warning

The New York Times (Nov 20, Sunday Business Section) carries a warning
from two Yale professors against a new management technique that can
be misused to snoop on personnel through sophisticted mathematical
analysis of communications, including computer network usage.

Professors Scott Boorman, a Yale sociologist, and Paul Levitt,
research mathematician at Yale and Harvard (economics) who authored
the article also invented the technique some years ago.  Briefly, it
consists of computer-intensive analysis of personnel communications to
divide them into groups or "blocks" depending on who they communicate
with, whom they copy on messages, who they phone and who's calls don't
they return.

Blocks of people so identified can be classified as dissidents,
potential traitors or "Young Turks" about to split off their own
company, company loyalists, promotion candidates and so forth.
"Guilt by association" is built into the system since members of the
same block may not even know each other but merely copy the same person
on memos.

The existence of an informal organization as a powerful directing
force in corporations, over and above the formal organization chart,
has been recognized for a long time.  The block analysis method
permits and "x-ray" penetration of these informal organizations
through use of computer on-line analysis which may act, per the
authors, as "judge and jury."

The increasing usage of electronic mail, voice storage and forward
systems, local networks and the like make clandestine automation of
this kind of snooping simple, powerful, and almost inevitable.  The
authors cite as misusage evidence the high degree of interest in the
method by iron curtain government agencies.

An early success (late 60's) was also demonstrated in a Catholic
monastery where it averted organizational collapse by identifying
members as loyalists, "Young Turks," and outcasts.  Currently,
interest is high in U.S. corporations, particularily the internal
audit departments seeking to identify dissidents.

As the authors warn, this revolution in computers and information
systems bring us closer to George Orwell's state of Oceania.

On VMS V4, you can no longer say "FILE TT:" to dump mail in order to see
escape sequences, etc.  This will create a folder named "TT:".  However,
you may now use the new MAIL command "EXTRACT TT:", which will give the
desired effect.

uttered when he punished a pupil for "fighting a liar in the quad" [quad
abb. quadrangle = smart name for school playground].

How come there are so many high-tech billboards?  According to Mass High Tech
two reasons emerged in an interview with the head of a billboard company:

        1. They're cheap.

        2. "The other reason has to do with the noveau-ubiquity of technology
            products.  'Twenty years ago there really wasn't much to sell
            except cigarets and cars,' says the billboard executive."

A high-tech company, by the way, is defined by the Mass High Tech Council
as a firm that spends more than 5 per cent of its annual sales revenue on

Could you please remove the reference to DND ( Dungeon ) in your LOGIN.COM ?

I've just had a memo from the States that says we must not have the DND
program on any machines, nor any references to it.

If you happen to know of any versions of DND anywhere ( even renamed
versions ! ), i would like to know.

Thanx !

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I'd say the chance of Dungeon (DND, Zork, whatever) disappearing
entirely from all DEC machines is close to 0 (zero).  As I heard it,
some pseudoconscientious dope (from Merrimack?) asked a company lawyer
if it was legal and natch the lawyer said it wasn't and the dope
started hassling everybody to get rid of their copies of the game.  A
little judicious renaming of files and tasks should stop this madness.
The game is out of the bottle, and has been for five years, and it
won't get back in.  The RSTS Professional magazine gives away color
maps of the Dungeon as a promo.

William Steig (the cartoonist) wrote and illustrated a book called

on a license plate; hence came up with such exhortations as

  [mother, telling child to eat breakfast]   M N X S L-T 4 U!

Extending Steig's character set a bit by allowing the plus and minus

                          London once, though I knew the owner only from
                          hearsay).

Seen in an MRO3 parking lot:

                IBM-QC

Apparently the owner of said vehicle was a recent defector from Big Blue, and
had not had time to change his/her plate, since beside the plate on the bumper
was an "I &lt;heart&gt; Digital" sticker!

Vanity plate seen on a Fiat Turbo heading north:

        EX DECI

The driver was a bearded young gent wearing wire-rimmed glasses,
so I assume he was indeed a former colleague.  An odd and negative
way to describe oneself, eh?

The object of vanity plates is, of course, to be vain.  Therefore I submit
for your approval (Rod Serling anyone?) the plate on my car.

                X-DECI

(only somewhat appropo. now )

Of course, everyone knows that the SDC is giving free Cabbage Patch
Kid dolls away tomorrow afternoon.  They have only 2000 dolls, so be
sure to be there right after lunch.  Santa will be arriving at that
time by helicopter with the dolls.

Santa also has several hundred Adam computers to give away, including
documentation and Russ Walter's phone number.  If you end up with an
extra Adam, you might give it to Russ.  He's the Adam hotline, but he
doesn't quite have his Adam yet.
