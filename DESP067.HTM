                          Just a word of explanation

         This is the article that appeared in the Washington Post about
         my  Nearest  And  Dearest.   The author was interviewing Steve
         because he was doing research on an article for the New Yorker
         on  Nolan Bushnell, and apparently he and Steve hit it off and
         he wrote this piece in the Washington  Post.   The  next  day,
         Steve got calls from Newsweek and the CBS Morning News wanting
         more information!  Instant Celebrity!   The  author  is  wrong
         about one thing though;  Steve has one other obsession besides
         trains and computers:  Mozart!

                            VINTAGE VIDEO WHIZ

     Long Ago, Steve Russell Invented 'Spacewar!'

     By Tom Zito

          BOSTON--Yesterday afternoon, even as scholars were discussion the
     cultural  and  educational  impact  of  video  games  at  a  three-day
     symposium sponsored by Harvard University, Steve Russell was sitting a
     few  miles  to  the  west  in the Waltham offices of Interactive Data,
     where he was using a  CDI  portable  terminal  to  debug  a  financial
     management program he has been writing for the Chase Manhattan Bank.

          Russell, a 45-year-old computer whiz, is  one  of  the  guys  the
     symposium  forgot:   21  years  ago,  in  a Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology laboratory less than a mile from Harvard, he invented video
     games.

          Although this achievement is generally ascribed to another person
     not invited to the conference--Nolan Bushnell, the 40-year-old founder
     of Atari, because he conceived the game  "Pong"--Russell  created  his
     inter-galactic, shoot-'em-up "Spacewar!" long before Bushnell had ever
     laid his hands on a terminal.

          "There's no doubt," says  Bushnell,  "that  'Spacewar!'  made  me
     realize there was money to be made in computer games--a notion Russell
     says he and some of his computer buddies "thought about for maybe four
     days,  but  you  could  calculate  on the back on an envelope how many
     quarters it would take to buy a computer and there was no way we could
     imagine it working."

          Russell seems cut from the classic cloth of  creative  computing:
     he's  fascinated by electronics and games (he has two computers in his
     home, and his favorite game is "Megabug," a maze exploration program);
     he  has  only  one other obsession:  trains, both model and real;  his
     shirt pocket is stuffed with pens (seven, in four  different  colors).
     He  was  born  in  Connecticut  to  a mechanical engineer father and a
     schoolteacher mother.  His  parents  moved  to  Washington  state  and
     eventually  bought  a dairy farm;  Russell returned east to study math
     at Dartmouth, and left shortly before graduation to work at  MIT  with
     John  McCarthy,  a  pioneer  in  artificial  intelligence research who
     developed the programming language LISP that is now almost universally
     used in artifical intelligence work.

          Just as Russell himself is  out  of  the  techno  tradition,  the
     development  of  "Spacewar!"  is similarly a basic and characteristic,
     although relatively unread, chapter in video game history;  like  many
     of the innovations in the field, it came about almost accidentally.

          Specifically, in the fall of 1962, the  Digital  Equipment  Corp.
     donated to MIT's artifical intelligence lab a prototype of its Program
     Data Processing computer, better known as  the  DEC  PDP-1.   "It  was
     really the first appliance computer on the market," Russell says.  "If
     it was off you could walk in and turn on the power switch and  it  was
     running.   And  it was substantially cheaper than the IBM 370 that was
     most in use then:  $120,000 versus $1 million."

          Before "Spacewar!" there was only one crude tennis game, displays
     of  bouncing  balls  and  various  graphic patterns, and programs with
     titles like "Expensive Planetarium," "Expensive Typewriter"--so  named
     because  "to  do  adding  or typing for $120,000 is pretty expensive,"
     Russell says.

          "Somewhere around that time I  had  read  Doc  Smith's  'Lensman'
     series,  which has spaceships roaring around the universe.  There were
     a bunch of us who worked with the computer who were  always  wondering
     what  we  could  do to demonstrate its power and eventually we decided
     that we could create a demo that had something to do with a  spaceship
     and  have  it be like Lensman shooting around the universe.  I was one
     of the loudest talkers, and after a few months people were  asking  me
     how  come  I  wasn't  doing  something  about  it.  I said, 'I need to
     calculate angles and I don't know how to do sines and cosines.'"

          Another member of this video vanguard supplied Russell  with  the
     necessary  formulas.  The resultant game program, written in about six
     weeks, displayed on a cathode ray tube two spaceships that could  turn
     left  and right, move forward and fire torpedoes--a very sophisticated
     precursor of the arcade game "Asteroids" that would be  introduced  in
     1980.

          "The original  control  board  of  the  computer  had  18  toggle
     switches  for  entering  data  in the form of binary numbers," Russell
     says.  "We use the four on either end for controls.  We had to  change
     that  in  a  couple  of months for separate control boxes, because you
     always tended to get very sore elbows when  two  people  were  sitting
     beside each other at the computer terminal."

          The  control  boxes  looked   remarkably   like   precursors   of
     contemporary  joysticks:   they  could  maneuver  the  ship,  fire its
     thrusters and torpedoes,  and  eventually  jump  it  into  hyperspace.
     "There were two problems with the early game," Russell says.  "It gave
     too much advantage to the experienced  player  and  it  really  didn't
     exploit  the power of the computer, which had a little more than 8K of
     memory."

          The games spread quickly to most college campuses.  Bushnell, for
     instance,  often  played  it  at  the  University of Utah, and Russell
     himself finally realized what he had created a few years later when he
     moved to Stanford University.

          "One night we were working  very  late  and  went  out  for  some
     hamburgers,"  Russell  says.   "There  were a bunch of guys in the bar
     playing pinball, and we all got thrown  out  when  the  place  closed.
     When  I  got  back  to  the  lab, I noticed that the guys who had been
     playing pinball also worked at the lab.  When they came in  they  went
     over  to a terminal, and loaded 'Spacewar!'.  That was when I realized
     that we had created the new pinball machine.

          "Maybe I was just ahead of my time.  I  have  no  regrets  really
     that  I didn't make any money at it.  I had fun, which is what I think
     computers are all about.  And I'm not sure I have  the  tolerance  for
     the nonsense that goes with big-bucks consumer electronics."

          And  although  Russell  may  not  have   received   much   public
     acknowledgement  for  his creation, for years his work was immortal in
     the computer business:  after its creation every DEC PDP-1 was shipped
     from  the  factory  with the "Spacewar!" program loaded in its memory.
     "If the machine survived shipment," Russell  says,  "first  thing  the
     customer ever saw was my game."

Subject: not only in Silicon Valley

In #1048, there are a couple letters about the Silicon Valley Guy
book. In particular, there is a comment about a teenaged SVG who finds
it necessary to hijack a truck full of arc lamps in order to replace a
light bulb.

This strongly brought to mind an old friend of mine.  As a teenager in
Rockford Illinois (a real armpit of a town), he entertained himself in
some inventive ways.

For example, he made a hovercraft, which he and his friends roped to a
car, whipping the craft and passenger through traffic.  He also had a
rocket launcher in his car's hood ornament.  You pressed a button on
the dash and got real fireworks.

As for his exploits in college, you have to remember that this was
1969, and we were going to change the world, you see.  At the time,
using the term "liberating" seemed to justify theft, as long as you
liberated the property of a large organization.  (The larger the
organization, the more immoral it had to be.  Ripping off the phone
company was especially admirable.) Anyway, the University of Illinois
qualified under these criteria, so he pilfered a variety of lab
equipment.  This gets us to the comment about hijacking a truckload of
arc lamps for the astrodome.  He didn't quite do this.  He just swiped
the PA horns off the top of the football stadium.  Horns are, of
course, accousticly very efficient, so they made a great effect in the
dorm booming out Led Zepplin from his 200 watts per channel amplifier
(the amp was his design, of course).

He also bugged the phone of the dormitory Casanova, tapped phone
company power to run his AM station (which had obscene call letters,
of course), and ... well, there was the time I didn't talk to him for
a while.  I don't want to go into details in such a public forum, but
suffice it to say that there was an incident involving me, my
girlfriend, and a television camera which broadcasted on channel 13.
With sound, too.  The camera was lifted from a psychology lab; I don't
recall where he obtained the microphone.

No, he doesn't work for DEC.  He runs a computer repair business in
the West, and is constructing a robot in his spare time.  He knows a
lot about AI, so the robot may be quite capable.

A New Jersey high school student yesterday was awarded the
distinction of being the best bad writer among thousands of
students who entered a university professor's bad-writing
contest. The winners among the 6000 adults from 50 nations
who entered the contest were announced a month ago, "but we
wanted tot take our time with the Juvenile Division," San
Jose (Calif.) State University English professor Scott Rice
said. Andrew Sterbenz, 18, a student at Delran High School
in Delran, N.J., took first place with:

        "He did not notice the pouring rain, the thunder, the
lightning, the futile attempts of the sun to pierce through
the relentless clouds in the early dawn as he sauntered into
Dunkin' Donuts, removing his rainsoaked greatcoat, brushing
a mauve thread from the sleeve of his genuine polyester
imitation leather jacket, inhaling the intoxicating aroma of
cream-filled eclairs and double chocolate munchkins, and
gazing at the waitress through his polarized Cool-ray
photo-sensitive corrective lenses --- such pleasures were
for lesser men, he thought."

        To write that badly, "you have to be good," Rice said.

My own work in this important area includes this specimen:

        "The girl was ravaged as she walked down the inky-darkened
         street."

I was attempting to write so badly as to be disqualified by the
Mail-order Writer's School of Minneapolis, founded by Cecil B.
DeMille.  It did not work.  A salesman called to tell me I had won a
