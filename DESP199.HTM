        Imagine a life so barren that getting a "toot" on the Home
        Shopping Club could brighten it.  And, while I'm being
        existential, what if the heartbeat of America *is* today's
        Chevrolet?

        Some memo somewhere in some corporation had a reference to
        "proprietary-like features".  I can't remember now whether that
        was a good thing or a bad thing.

Subj:   Some further pedantic comments RE lingerie

The following text is written by my daughter Mandy, who's a Freshman
at Harvard studying French, *inter alia,* and who saw and immediately
objected to Tricia Fisher's etymological disquisition on
euphemistically-named french lingerie.  I give you the inimitable
Amanda, herewith:

While it is true that one has only one neck, the French are a bit
confused about what needs to be done with it.  The French word for bra
is, in fact, _soutien-gorge_ -- literally, "support-throat".
Apparently the French have saggier necks than we do in the U.S.

Another small correction:  _un coup_ is a blow or a stroke.  The
general word for  neck is _le cou_, an entirely different thing.  It's
proof of the insanity of French pronunciation, though, that these two
words sound exactly the same.  The final _p_ is silent.  Just like in
English, right?

And even if the etymology of the English word brassiere is pretty silly,
I for one would rather refer to "my bra" than to "my mammary-holder".
Accuracy is not always the best thing in the world.

Cheers,
Dan and Mandy Kalikow

  Small correction to Tricia Fisher's description of the French word for
  brassiere: it's "soutien-gorge" (throat support), which conjures up
  images of long-necked ladies, or double chins.

Subj:   On Bras in France...

I was a bit puzzled by the little french lesson given in 2028.  During
my recent 5 years living in France, bras were consistently referred to
as "soutien gorge" (sorry about the spelling). A rough translation would
be "throat support" or "neck support."

&gt;Re: Desperado # 2027

&gt;I suspect that the singular usage for
&gt;brassiere comes from an unwillingness to allude to the actual part
&gt;of the anatomy covered by that article of clothing.  Americans use
&gt;the French word for "arm covering", while the French call them
&gt;"un couvre-coup", literally "neck covering."

Couvre-cou isn't a word.  The French word for bra is "soutien-gorge"
which means throat support.

The word for neck is "cou", not "coup". (but the p in coup is silent)

Well, gosh, what *do* I say to a French lady when I want to discuss her upper
underwear?  Strange, isn't it, that we have two words in English for that
garment - brassiere and bandeau - both very French sounding to my Georgia ear
and yet the frog-eating French have two compeletely different words, each even
more French-sounding, and at least one of them mythical.  I wonder what the
Belgians say?

If brassiere means "arm protector", it may explain something about Venus de Milo
to the Goedel-Escher-Bach crowd.

Quelle merde!  I don't even speak French, except in kissing, and yet this stuff
continue' la bas.

&gt;&gt;I've
&gt;&gt;just been informed that the frog-eating French say "dix jours" (10
&gt;&gt;mornings) when they mean a week and "quinze jours" (15 mornings) when they
&gt;&gt;mean two weeks.

&gt;"Jour" means "day" in French.  "Morning" is "matin".

And the expression for one week is in fact "huit jours" (8 days), not
ten.  Hmmm, 8 days vs.  7, 15 days vs.  14...  off-by-one error? Is the
Beatles song "Eight days a week" in fact a French allusion? Is Paul dead?

Thank you for reprinting the piece on Roy Orbison. It was very sad and
very good.

As to thorpes, I think I like the Archimedes monothorpe. (As a bit of
a purist, I like seeing people acknowledge the name "octothorpe" for
the common or garden variety hashmark, teehee. Bloody phone company.
(Or did they get it from someplace other than themselves?)) Speaking
of which, typenames were given for (, ), [, ], &lt;, or &gt;. (I ain't quite

&gt;If "#" is an octothorpe then it doesn"t take a big leap of faith to
&gt;assume that "*" is a hexathorpe.

Hmmm.... on my workstation a "hexathorpe" looks more like a "pentathorpe".
Granted the representation on the keyboard has six points, but all the
terminals I use (as well as printed documents) display asteriks as five
pointed stars.

Who's responsible for this blunder?

Why don't you come to your senses? :^)

Loved the part on exploding electronics!  Have you got any more on the bizarre
California demolition art?  That was great stuff, too.  But then, when I was a
kid, we used to take our old plastic models, pack them with firecrackers, dowse
them with lighter fluid, and torch them.  Very impressive results, needless to
say..

&gt;    *       -  hexathorpe

I don't know how your display device works, but even though the shifted "8" on
my LK201 keyboard shows a little six-pointed star, my VR160 with DECwindows has
a lovely five-sided star (is this a form of religious discrimination, excessive
patriotism, or just mimicing the IBM 1403 line printer?).  That makes it into a
pentathorpe in my book (or on my display), although it's more commonly called a
pentagram (oops, devil worship and witchcraft rears its head)..

Uh, buddy.

The asterisk in DECwindows dot matrix grotesque (typewriter) font appears to be
in fact a quadrathorpe.  They make up for this by having the ugliest "X" this

Subj:   A tale of postal woe

A while back, on a trip to Washington I bought a packet of self-adhesive
stamps.  Instead of using glue the stamps were pressed onto a plastic
sheet so you could peel them off when you needed them. They are great for
wallets because the glue isn't there to make the stamps stick together.
Little bit pricey $5 for 18 stamps but we gotta pay for technology right?

I return home and run out of these stamps. Go down to the local post
office for another batch. Bad idea. Turns out that the stampos are a test
market in some 12 cities. Boston isn't one of them.

So I call the post office stamp by phone service 1 800 stamp 24. You can
order stamps by visa or mastercard this way. First off they want my credit
card number followed by my name and address, zip code. Then they ask me
for my state and city. Now they are the post office - don't they have
access to the zip code listing? Then it turns out that they only sell
regular stamps and not this special item.

Then I remember that I had picked up a catalog  for stamp collectors to
order stamps by mail. They do  sell the self-adhesive stamps by mail. You
can  also call them and order stamps by phone (payment by credit card).
Call them up and go through the  same questions including the state and
city. They don't hjave their computers tied into the zip code database
either! "We're just not that advanced sir," said  the clerk, who was
extremely helpful nonetheless.

Now I'm not asking for the postal service to have  advanced telemarketing
with incoming caller identification so they can poick up my name and
automatically  retrieve my file from the database (assuming that I am a
regular customer). But it would be be nice if they could pick up the zip
code info and make a stab at guessing my location- it would give us
cuystomers some faith that the post office is trying to do the best that
it can.

To top it all off I went to my local post office  to ask for another
stamp - a hologram of a space shuttle which is embossed ont an envelope.
Costs 30 cents (it's a 25 cent stamp). The  local clerks had heard about
it but the only people who had them were some clerks who are only on duty
during the week (this was on a Saturday) I didn't know that buying stamps
was a personal service!

      Subject: How do you measure nuclear warhead yield?

    This is something I learned at the USENIX Conference in January that
    I've been meaning to post here, but have managed to forget about until
    now.

    While chatting with some network acquaintances at the hotel bar (all
    the important discussion occurs at the bar, of course, preferably well
    past midnight), a friend who does sysadmin work at Los Alamos National
    Labs told us a marvelously funny story about how the fun folks at LANL
    measure yield from nuclear detonations.  After all, they have to
    experiment, I guess, and one has to learn how much bang-for-the-Mbuck
    one is getting.

    The solution at LANL (note that this is now an 8-week-old memory,
    details may be somewhat inaccurate):

    Find a Qbus-based PDP-11 (e.g., 11/73) "which you no longer love."
    Install a DEQNA ethernet controller card in the backplane.  Park the
    box at/near/over the hole.  Connect a cable to the DEQNA and drop it
    down into the hole.

    DEQNAs have a TDR (time domain reflectometer) built right into the
    controller.  TDR is useful for finding cable shorts and, in general,
    learning the length of one's ethernet cable.

    Before detonation, begin having the PDP-11 repeatedly exercise the
    DEQNA's TDR, recording and transmitting the length determined to some
    other (presumably distant :-) site.

    Detonate.  As the beastie blows things to smithereens all around
    itself, the cable will be rapidly eaten away.  TDR readings from the
    DEQNA will show a drastically reducing cable length.  The speed with
    which the cable, ah, degenerates will correlate very closely with
    warhead yield.

    Just think, your tax dollars at work, ridding the world of PDP-11s...

    --karl

      TOKYO (UPI) -- Sony Corp. unveiled a ``palm top'' computer Wednesday
with a small screen and electronic pen that turns handwritten notes into
typed letters and hailed it as the beginning of the age of a computer
for everyone.
      Sony and electronics experts described the Palm Top PTC-500 as a
significant breakthrough that could make personal computers as common as
Walkman portable stereos.
      ``This machine has historical significance,'' said Toshi Doi, the
director of Sony's micro computer group. ``The product is targeted for a
far wider range of potential users in the coming era of a computer for
everyone.''
      The computer, which measures 8.2 by 6.3 inches with a height of 1.8
inches, uses ``fuzzy logic'' to recognize letters drawn on a 6-by-4-inch
screen and convert them into typed letters that can be printed out on a
computer printer or fax machine, the company said.
      It eliminates the need to learn how to type on a keyboard.
      ``You don't have to read thick manuals or go to training courses to
be able to use this machine,'' said Doi.
      ``This could be the next Walkman,'' said Tom Murtha, an electronics
analyst with Baring Securities Japan.
      ``If anyone is going to break through the man-machine barrier, it
should be Sony,'' Murtha said.
      The Palm Top computer will debut in Japan April 1 at a cost of
$1,320 and Sony eventually hopes to offer a version for export, said
Makoto Araki, a Sony spokesman.
      Fuzzy logic is a set of reasoning rules that enables a computer to
process information expressed in vague and imprecise terms.
 Fuzzy logic has been used in Japanese computers to imitate human
reactions for functions that require flexible responses, such as
starting and stopping subway trains.
      The user of the Palm Top computer writes on the screen with a
pen-like instrument and the computer reads the writing and organizes it
for retrieval or printing.
      For example the time and place of an appointment can be written on
the screen and filed into a calendar, Araki said. The computer will
automatically file the appointment into the proper place in the user's
schedule, which can then be called up for review.
      The Japanese model is able to recognize 3,500 handwritten Japanese
characters.
      The computer's fuzzy logic allows it to recognize more than 1
million variations of the characters to match the individual writing
style of the user, the company said.
      ``A keyboard is still faster and will continue to be used by many
people,'' Araki said.
      ``But for those who have not learned how to type, the Palm Top will

      Future Palm Top computers could be programmed to read shorthand,
making them almost as fast as a keyboard computer, he added.

Subj:   Looks like Romania has no problem with their gun laws

     According to American Rifleman:

         Romanian national shooting team members, including 1988 free
         pistol gold medalist Sorin Babii, were cited for "genuine
         acts of heroism" by the Romanian news agency.  Although
         reports were rather sketchy, it would seem the marksmen
         applied their skills to wipe out a group of "terrorists" that
         presumably were loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.

    To me, this would seem to make the marksmen professionals rather than
    amateurs and thus disqualifies them from future Olympic competition.

Subj:   Omit Needless Words

The ultimate in succinct documentation was featured in the "Selling
It" page of this month's Consumer Reports.  The product, an automobile
windshield-washer pump, says on the box "Installation Data Inside".
Consumer Reports admits that there's nothing very hard about
installing one of these, but says "you might be forgiven for expecting
a tad more than was provided.  The instructions inside read: 'Replace
items on vehicle with items contained in this kit.'"

Hi.  This is so funny, I had to share it with you.  It ought to be part of
a Monty Python act!

The story: I'm trying to figure out some Motif behavior stuff.  My "source"
is a document called the Motif Style Guide Technical Specification.  Reading
it is like wading through mud!  It's ugly!  It's technical!  It's full of
jargon!

So, to get some help I wrote up some questions and sent them to Ellis Cohen at
OSF.  Ellis wrote the technical spec, so I was going straight to the horse's
mouth, so to speak.

I told Ellis that I was confused about the difference between a "field" and
a "group".  This is what he wrote back... (brace yourself!)

I wrote: "First, I'm a bit confused on the exact definition of a Field versus a
Group."

His reply:

"A group is a component that has subcomponents.
A control is a component that has no subcomponents.

Some controls and some groups are fields.  Some are not.

Field controls are fields.  Other controls are not fields.

Some groups are automatically fields -- in particular,
   basic groups, dialogue boxes, and the top-level group in a window.
Other groups are not made fields automatically , although a client can
   explicitly set any group to be a field.

If a field is a control, then traversing to a field simply traverses to
   that control.
If a field is a group, then traversing to a field traverses to some
   control in the field -- the default controls if there is one,
   otherwise the top-left most one (in a l to r language environment)

Be careful.  Since groups may be nested, fields may be nested too.
When you traverse to such a field, you will land on a control
   that is in that field and not in a field nested within it."

Oh!  It's all perfectly clear now! :-)

Subj:   News of the Weird

&gt;From last Sunday's News of the Weird

In a survey of female prostitutes for a January AIDS article in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, the median number of
sexual partners reported was 2,900, with a range of from five to
93,740.

About 26 tricks a day for ten years.  The mind boggles.  Not just the
mind.

And not only has she been a workaholic, she's also found time to keep

Uh huh.  It doesn't say what the sampling period is, but if it's annual that's
about 256 per day.  Awfully busy little beaver.

It just now occurred to me that my 26-a-day-for-a-decade assumes no
repeat customers.  Jonathan is right.  Her memory for faces must be
phenomenal.  (:-,)

From:   DECPA::"till@lucid.com" "Don Tillman"

I'm guessing the number comes from something like a 30-year or longer
career bringing the average down to eight customers or so a day.  I'm
also guessing that the language is less than accurate and the numbers
include all customers, repeat or otherwise.

There's gotta be some impressive celebration planned for the
100,000-th customer though.
