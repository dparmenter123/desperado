Thieves:

Your robbery story reminded me of *my* robbery story.  A couple of
weeks ago I came home to find that I had been burgled.  I can't
call it a break in, because they walked in my open bulkhead
door and merrily carried things off.  A partial list:

* My VCR but not the equally portable panasonic television it was
attached to

* A cheap black and white television that lived in the kitchen

* My wonderful Makita Power Drill with level and angles (the only
thing I've replaced so far)

* My dust buster (which they probably figured I wouldn't miss)

* All of my 35 mm cameras and none of my cheap junky cameras or
polaroid

* My sports watch (so they could tell how nervous they were and
measure their blood pressure

and a brand new piece of luggage that they apparently used to haul
it all off

When I discovered my drill was missing I went down in the basement
to see if they got any of my other power tools.  My saw was sitting
happily on the saw horse and next to it was a portable sump pump,
all boxed up nicely, with a manual.  It weren't *my* sump pump.

Since the bulkhead door was open because I was airing
out the basement from a recent flood, I thought it was a nice, although
suspicious touch...

The police didn't behave at all like the television cops...they took
a phone report.  (I guess I expected sirens and drawn guns...)  When
I told them the thieves had left something and they might be able
to get finger prints from that, they came over and managed to get
prints (it wouldn't surprise me if they were their own, since I shrieked
at them when they went to grab the box to take it away with them.)

They apparently didn't spend their lives watching cop shows to get the
genre right.

        Document:       FISHnet Product Description

        Revision History:

        First draft, V0.1:      MWLP 22-May-1991 A.D.

      Introducing FISHnet, the office communication system of the future.

FISHnet, Fiber Interoffice Sound Hose network is a cooperative effort between
Digital Equipment Corporation, True Value Hardware stores and Herman's Sporting
Goods. The FISHnet enables local area communications via industry standard
conveyance materials and low cost hardware using analog auditory wave
propagation.

FISHnet hardware consists of simple wave propagation material referred to as
the Signal Transmit/Receive Interconnect Network Grid (STRING). Digital has
selected high strength plastic media commonly used in the maritime industry as
the basis for STRING. STRING is connected at the appropriate end point
communication stations to a Cylindrical Accumulator Node (CAN). The CAN itself
is an industry standard open solution to many containment engineering problems
and is innovatingly being utilized here for communication services. STRING to
CAN connections are handled by the ingenious Key Native Ocillation Transfer
(KNOT) devices devised by Digital Equipment Corporation. This simple, yet
elegant, interface device took years to perfect and has undergone rigorous
testing at our Littleton, MA facility. Multi node STRING configurations are
implemented utilizing the Entry Yoke Enterprise-wide Hose Ocillation Organizing
Kernal (EYE-HOOK). Through a combination of KNOT and EYE-HOOK technologies,
STRING can be configured across fairly large distances without loss of signal
power. If larger distances are necessary, a separate product, the Yield
Enhancing Language Launcher (YELL) is available to boost signal power.

                        Without you I can't be free.
                        You make me pant considerably.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        You have the finest rosebud's taste.
                        Without you my life is waste,
                        I'll stick to you like Elmer's paste.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        I'd break through a citadel.
                        I'd fight with a raging bull,
                        Though winning would seem improbable.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        My love's as strong as the mid-ocean ridge.
                        You shine like the rainbow bridge
                        or like that light inside my fridge.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        For you I'd consume haggis,
                        or lose the joys of Bacchus,
                        or live in sin with Mike Dukakis.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        No time's too long for me to wait.
                        For you, I'd fight against Fate,
                        though maybe you could lose some weight,
                        You're my love guppy.

                        Without you, I'd be not whole,
                        I would have to sell my soul,
                        or gulp a quart of Tide-E-Bowl.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        My passion is always mounting.
                        I'm like a geyser founting.
                        Well, maybe not, but who's counting?
                        You're my love guppy.

                        The love that is the more intense
                        always has the most silence,
                        like quiet bursts of flatulence.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        I know that my love is true.
                        I know that you'll love me too,
                        or I'll hold my breath 'till I turn blue
                        You're my love guppy.

                        I'd not forget you if I tried.
                        You make me all warm inside.
                        My love's as pure as Naugahyde.
                        You're my love guppy.

                        Then I hear the words let slip
                        From betwixt impatient lips,
                        "I want to have a relationship.
                        You're my love guppy."

Here's another tidbit from Effector Online (1.06.)

        All I Really Need to Know I Learned from My Computer

All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I
learned right here in the CAEN labs. Illumination was not at the top of the
graduate school mountain, but right there in front of the computer
monitors. These are the things I learned. Everything you need to know is
here somewhere:

        1.      Share all your executables.
        2.      Pay for your shareware.
        3.      Don't hit the computer.
        4.      Back up files after you have found them.
        5.      Clean up your own messy desktop.
        6.      Don't copy software that is not yours.
        7.      Make a smiley when you send someone a nasty message.
        8.      Wash your hands before you type.
        9.      Flush your buffers.
        10.     M&amp;Ms and a cold can of Coke are good for you.
        11.     Live a student's life--learn some and think some and
                MacDraw and IPaint and Readnews and play Tetris and hack
                every day some.
        12.     Take a break every two hours from staring at the terminal.
        13.     When you go out in the world, watch out for network traffic,
                hold connections and stick together.
        14.     Be aware of wonder. Remember the little bytes in the chip:
                The code goes in and the graphics come out and nobody
                really knows how or why, but computers are all like that.
        15.     Pets and Lisas and DN350s and even the little bytes in the
                chip all die. So do we.
        16.     And then remember the Computer Reference Manuals and the
                first command you learned--the biggest command of all--Quit.

Subj:   Subductive Carmen: a lesson in I18N, translation?

The following program notes, for a performance of Bizet's Carmen at the
Genoa Opera House, were translated from the original Italian for the
benefit of  English-speaking attendees.  Keep in mind that the author was
probably working from a French-to-Italian translation of the libretto or
program notes. If you  always wondered what all the fuss was about Carmen
but were doomed to  ignorance because you don't understand French (or
because you can't stand  opera), here's your chance to broaden yourself:

ACT I

Carmen is a cigar makeress from a tobago factory who loves with Don Jose of
the mounting guard.  Carmen takes a flower from her corsets and lances it
to Don Jose. (Duet: "Talk Me of My Mother.")  There is a noise inside the
tobago factory, and the revolting cigar makeresses bursts into the stage.
Carmen is arrested and Don Jose is ordered to mounting guard her.  But
Carmen subduces him and he lets her escape.

ACT II

The Tavern.  Carmen's aria "The Sistroms are Tinkling." Enter Escamillo, a
ballsfighter.  Enter two smuglers. Duet: "We Have in Mind a Business.") But
Carmen refuses to penetrate because Don Jose has liberated her from prison.
He just now arrives. (Aria: "Slop, here who comes.")  But hear are the
bugles singing his retreat.  Don Jose will leave and draws his sword.
Called by Carmen, shrieks the two smuglers interfere with her, but Don Jose
is bound to dessert.  He will follow into them. (Final chorus: "Opening
skies, Wandering Life.")

ACT III

A roky landscape.  The smugler's shelter.  Carmen sees her death in cards,
and Don Jose makes a date with Carmen for the next fight.

ACT IV

A place in Seville. Procession of ballsfighters.  The roaring is heard in
the arena.  Escamillo enters.  (Aria and chorus: "Toreador, Toreador.")
Enter Don Jose. (Aria: "I do not threaten, I besooch you.")  But Carmen
rebels him, wants to join with Escamillo. Now chaired by the crowd, Don
Jose stabs her.  (Aria: "O rupture, rupture, you may arrest me, I did kill
her.") He sings "O my beautiful Carmen, my subductive Carmen."

"A piece of the rock -- in the mail"

RANCHO PALOS VERDES (AP)

You might call them postcards from the ledge.

Aritst Nick Agid carves messages into slabs of stone and mails them to
politicians, celebrities, world leaders, authors and fellow artisans.

Using material left over from his sculpture work, Agid has lovingly
etched more than 600 mineral missives out of onyx, marble and granite.

"It started out being a whim, and it became a serious art project," he says.

He spends about an hour chiseling a message onto each polished stone,
always includng a request for a reply.

The cost of mailing the four- to five-pound cards is high -- up to $10
a throw, and much more for international celebrities. But Agid doesn't mind.

Celebrity Recipients
--------------------

"The responses were so humorous, it became kind of addicting to check
the mail and see who wrote me back," he said.  "I got a letter from the
pope and Ted Kennedy on the same day."

Many who have gotten the rock cards -- including President Bush,
Elizabeth Taylor, Mel Brooks, Ray Bradbury and Vincent Price -- have responded.

Price sent his response on the inner sole of a shoe, writing, "Upon my
sole, I've never had such a heavy fan letter.  Are you sure you have
all your marbles?"

Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, R-Los Angeles, known for opposing the National
Endowment for the Arts, cast stones at Agid's endeavor.

"The only true value something like your brick has is that which people
will voluntarily pay for it," he said.  "That's why so many no-talent
artists end up seeking grants from the NEA."

San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse took the Postal Service to
task for the way it handled his five-pound slab of onyx.

"I stil have the rock," he wrote in his column.  "It arrived in a
plastic envelope and says 'Damaged in Shipment.'  Only the post office
could damage a rock."

Postal Workers Balk
-------------------

Relations between Agid and the Postal Service are indeed a bit rocky.
Postal workers tend to balk when he shows up with as many as 40 stone
slabs to mail.

"We were never mad at him," said Betty Baker, a clerk at the Torrance
Post Office.  "It's just we avoid him.  It takes so much time to mail
his rocks.  It gets our counters real dirty."

At one point, the Postal Service threatened to stop accepting Agid's
mailings.  Word was that one of his rocks broke a conveyer belt.

To smooth things over, he sent a carved card to Postmaster General
Anthony Frank, who wrote back, "It is always a pleasure to be contacted
by one of our customers, especially one as rock-solid as you are."

Agid plans to put the responses he's gotten into a book.

"I have brought a few laughs into the lives of the people who have

you never know what to expect from then on."

GUANGZHOU, China -- The Cantonese people of south China are legendary for
eating anything that moves -- and some things that are still moving. The
food market here features cats, raccoons, owls, doves and snakes along with
bear and tiger's paw, dried deer penis and decomposed monkey skeletons.

Now, this rich culinary tradition, along with rising disposable income in
this most prosperous city in China, has inspired kitchen utensil salesman
Zhang Guoxun to open what is believed to be China's first restaurant
dedicated to serving rat.

That's right: Rat. Rat with Chestnut and Duck. Lemon Deep Fried Rat.
Satayed Rat Slices with Vermicelli. In fact, the menu lists 30 different
rat dishes, even including Liquored Rat Flambe, along with more mundane
dishes such as Hot Pepper Silkworm, Raccoon With Winter Melon and Sliced
Snake and Celery. And in the six months since the doors opened, customers
have been scampering in at all hours to the euphemistically named Jialu
(Superior to Deer) Restaurant.

"I was always eating out, but I got bored with the animals that restau-
rants offered," Mr. Zhang says during an interview over a plate of Black-
Bean Rat. "I wanted to open a restaurant with an affordable exotic animal.
Then I was walking home one night and a rat ran across in front of me and
gave me this idea."

Mr. Zhang's restaurant is as trendy as they come in China. The 15-table,
two-story eatery is a mixture of blond wood furniture, stucco walls and
wooden lattice laced with plastic vines. Tonight's crowd includes a young
couple who stroll in hand-in-hand and nestle in a quiet corner for a
romantic rat dinner. Other groups include engineers, office clerks,
salesmen and factory workers.

Tonight's special is Braised Rat. Garnished with sprigs of cilantro, the
morsels of rat meat are swaddled in crispy rat skin. The first nibble
reveals a rubbery texture. But the skin coats one's teeth with a stubborn
slime. The result is a bit like old chewing gum covered with Crisco.

But other dishes are better. German Black Pepper Rat Knuckle (rat should-
ers, actually; the knuckles are too small) tastes like a musty  combination
of chicken and pork. The rat soup, with delicate threads of rat  meat mixed
with thinly sliced potatoes and onions, is surprisingly sweet. Far and away
most appealing to the Western palate is Rat Kabob. The skewers of char-
coaled rat fillet are enlivened with slices of onion, mushroom and green
pepper and served smothered in barbecue sauce on sizzling iron plates that
are shaped like cows.

Also on the menu: a Nest of Snake and Rat, Vietnamese Style Rat Hot Pot, a
Pair of Rats Wrapped in Lotus Leaves, Salted Rat with Southern Baby
Peppers, Salted Cunning Rats, Fresh Lotus Seed Rat Stew, Seven-Color Rat
Threads, Dark Green Unicorn Rat -- and, of course, Classic Steamed Rat.
Generally, the presentation is quite elegant, with some dishes served with
lemon slices or scallions forming a border and others with carrots carved
into flower shapes.

Experienced rat eaters, however, warn that this is no meat to pig out on.
"Watch out," warns Wei Xiuwen, a factory manager eating at an adjacent
table. "If you eat too much rat, you get a nosebleed." Several customers
take off their shirts halfway through the meal because eating rat, like
dog, seems to raise the body temperature for some reason. That's why rat is
considered a winter food. In the summer, the restaurant does most of its
business during the late-night and early-morning hours, after the weather
cools down.

The restaurant is popular -- Mr. Zhang claims profits of $2,000 a month --
because it brings people back to their roots. The restaurant's cooks, and
most customers, are originally from the countryside, where as children they
ate air-dried rat meat. "If dried by a north wind, it tastes just like
duck," Che Yongcheng, an engineer and regular customer, says wistfully of
his favorite childhood snack.

For newcomers, Mr. Zhang has color brochures, featuring a photo of Rat
Kabobs alongside a bottle of Napoleon X.O. In both the menu and brochure,
the rats are referred to as "super deer" because Mr. Zhang says he wants to
separate his fare from the common sewer rats that even Cantonese might find
unappetizing. Mr. Zhang says his restaurant serves only free range rats,
wild rodents that feed on fruits and vegetables in the mountains a couple
of hundred kilometers to the north.

The brochure explains why rats are the health food for the 1990s. It says
the rats are rich in 17 amino acids, vitamin E and calcium. Eating them
promises to prevent hair loss, revive the male libido, cure premature
senility, relieve tension and reduce phlegm. A rat's "liver, gallbladder,
fat, brain, head, eye, saliva, bone, skin" are "useful for medical
treatment," says the brochure.

The restaurant's basement kitchen is a Dante's Inferno where shirtless
cooks sweat over huge woks atop howling gasfueled stoves that shoot flames
five feet in the air. Dozens of fat, ready-to-cook rats are piled in a
bamboo basket next to a crust-covered pump that noisily slurps up a small
river of scum that runs off the stove and across the floor.

The senior chef is not here tonight. An understudy, Huang Lingtun, clad in
rubber sandals and pants rolled up to his knees, explains how the rats are
rounded up. They're captured and cleaned by farmers who free-lance as rat
bounty hunters. Some smoke the rats out by setting fields on fire and
snaring the fleeing rats in nets attached to long bamboo poles. Others
string wires across fields to stun unsuspecting rodents with high voltage
charges. The rats, each about a half-pound, arrive at the restaurant
freshly gutted, beheaded and de-tailed.

Mr. Zhang says that the traditional recipes on his menu were suggested by
Tang Qixin, a farmer honored as a model worker by Mao in 1958 for his
prowess as a rat killer. Rat eradication campaigns have been a staple of
Chinese life since Mao declared war on the four pests -- rats, flies,
mosquitoes and bed bugs -- in the 1950s.

In 1984, the last Year of the Rat, the government launched an all-out
crusade in which an estimated 526 million rats were killed. In 1985, the
government tried to maintain the momentum by promoting rat meat as good
food, explaining that "rats are better looking than sea slugs and cleaner
than chickens and pigs."

Like most successful entrepreneurs during these times of shifting poli-
tical winds in China, Mr. Zhang is quick to highlight the patriotic nature
of his business rather than the personal economic benefits. "I am helping
the government by eliminating some pests and helping enrich some farmers,"
he says.

Mr. Zhang says he's too new to the business to think about a chain of rat
restaurants. But he says he's unconcerned about anyone stealing his idea.
"My quality is tops," he says, "so I'm not worried about competitors."

  From the NY Times, w/o permission:

  The annual Spring Comdex computer show in Atlanta earlier this month
  meant a booming business for the Bulletstop, an indoor firing range in
  suburban Marietta where customers can rent firearms and bullets to
  shoot anything they please, as long as it is already dead and fits
  through the doors.  The Bulletstop gave Comdex visitors a chance to
  vent their frustrations by venting PC's, printers, hard disks, monitors
  and manuals with lead.

  Paul LaVista, the owner, said about 10 groups of high-tech types came
  in during the Comdex show.  "I'm not a computer whiz, but one group
  brought in what looked like a hard disk and blasted it," he said.
  "Another bunch brought in some kind of technical manual.  The thing
  was enormous, about 2,000 pages.  They rented three machine guns --
  an Uzi, an M3 grease gun and a Thompson -- and when they were done it
  looked like confetti."

  "It must have been quite a show," LaVista said of Comdex.  "Doctors
  and computer types usually have a lot of pent-up anxiety, but these
  folks were dragging when they came in.  When they left they were
  really up.  The range looked like a computer service center after a
  tornado."

  LaVista said PC's were popular targets year-round.  "People are
  frustrated with them," he said.  A year ago seven or eight men carried
  in a giant old Hewlett-Packard printer.  "I ran an extension cord to it,
  and just as it started to whirr and spit out paper, they blasted  it,"
  he said.

Subj:   Consumer Reports evaluation of Vax

It might interest you DECies to know that Consumer Reports reviewed a Vax
in its January 1991 issue.  They evaluated the Vax (model 121/2) along
with a dozen other machines.  Impressively, the Vax rated 3rd behind the
_Host_H_Type_ and the _Sears_87781_.

Following are some selected quotes from the evaluation, which begins on
page 14 of the issue:

    "The _Sears_87791_ and the _Host_H_Type_ machines use powder.
    Both are upright, easy to maneuver, and equipped with a long power
    cord.
    ...
    The _Vax_ required our testers to play junior chemists, concocting
    two solutions with water.
    ...
    The _Vax_ was the only steamer that did a good job...  The _Host_
    machine removed motor oil very well, the _Vax_ removed spaghetti
    sauce very well, and the _Bissell_1631_, fair in almost every
    category, did the best job of removing wine.
    ...
    Anyone looking for a good steamer among the tested models is out of
    luck.  The _Vax_, rated good, has been discontinued; the remaining
    steamers were fair or poor."

The Ratings showed the _Vax_ in 3rd place of the 13 machines, with these
notes:

    o   Water resevoir, no hose, must be filled
    o   Has 6 to 6 1/2 foot suction hose
    o   Power cord at least 20 feet long
    o   Must remove two pieces of machine to empty container
    o   Vacuum nozzle beater bar helps loosen dirt
    o   Has 24-month warranty
    o   Size [35 oz] is in fluid ounces
    o   Model discontinued

All in all, quite a good carpet cleaner.  Its death may have been due to
the fact that the $400 pricetag made it substantially more expensive than
any of the other carpet cleaners.

First, its all the flag-burning stuff. Its not a religious symbol, its a flag.
Then its the rock&amp;roll HoF. I suppose you'd never consider the Grateful Dead
who've been around 27 years and still touring (without "corporate sponsorship")!
But it was seeing that 'Unix is a fake' posting YET AGAIN that did it...For
your perusal, from the GNU distribution...(By the way, the line "what was sliced
bread the greatest thing since" is from Steven Wright, I believe)

Article from _Computer Language_ by Bruce Tonkin.

     Several prominent software companies have caused a stir lately by dropping
all development work in Pascal and adopting Microsoft BASIC.  When queried all
have declined to comment about this move, but one company insider (code-named
Deep Poke) suggested talking to Niklaus Wirth to get the full story.
     Speaking from his home in Zurich, Switzerland, Wirth proved to be a far
more genial soul than one might imagine, being the founder of Pascal and all.
But the European lifestyle obviously agrees with him, and he was more than
willing to provide some insights into this strange phenomenon, currently taking
place in the computer industry.
     In fact, what began as an innocent inquiry eventually revealed a shocking
and exclusive piece of information: that the invention of Pascal nearly 20
years ago was intended entirely as a joke, an April Fools' prank.
     Wirth tried to explain.  "Every year at the Swiss Federal Institute for
Technology [the university in Zurich where Wirth is a professor of computer
science] I taught the same classes, gave the same tests, told the same
jokes," he began.  "it was boring.  I needed a little humor.  So I started
talking about this crazy language called Pascal.  Eventually, the Pascal joke
became so popular I just kept adding to it, making it more and more elaborate.
     "But some of the students went to class so seldom that they missed the
joke and thought Pascal was a real language!  Imagine the looks on their faces
when they got out into the world and discovered there was no such thing as a
language called Pascal.  Hoo-boy!  They sure learned to pay attention after
that!"  he said, giggling.
     Several of his better students, he continued, figured they'd make some
money by fleecing the people who actually believed in Pascal and so wrote a
simple Pascal compiler for this purpose.  It was actually a kind of prank, much
like selling elevator passes to high school freshmen.
     "Yes, yes," Wirth said, "the UCSD operating system started the same way.
The same bunch of rascals who did the whole Pascal thing kept pushing the idea
until it reached the point of complete absurdity.  They were hysterical!
Especially late at night - they'd come up with some really boffo material.
They the next week they'd modify it and it would get even more entertaining."
     Wirth's best student was Philippe Kahn, who he met while Kahn was a
student.  "I used to go to a small bistro called 'Der Blaue Engel' after my
classes, and it happened that Kahn played jazz saxophone there while people
danced on the tables."  Wirth was impressed with Kahn's talent and evident wit
and encouraged him to end his musical career and enter the lucrative field of
software comedy.  Once he explained Pascal's comedic possibilities, Kahn was
hooked and quickly agreed.
     Since most of the staff at Apple Computer Inc. was educated at the
University of California at San Diego, they were also in on the joke, Wirth
said.  "That's why they kept pushing Pascal.  A bunch of fine kids, those Apple
guys.  Born comedians, most of them.  Except this one guy - he had no sense
of humor at all. [Editor's hint: not Woz.]
     "When we finally decided to do a DOS that was even funnier than UCSD
Pascal, the feeling was that UCSD was already the ultimate.  But then one of
the guys proposed doing a DOS that was written in Pascal but used hieroglyphics
instead of a written language.  What a genius!  We were rolling in the aisles.
But that one guy, he thought we were serious.  What a nerd!"
     Wirth's list of the funniest features of Pascal begins with the lack of a
string data type, no random file access, primitive numeric handling, and the
existential absurdity of the semicolon.
     "But I'd have to say that my crowning achievement was the lack of input
and output functions.  First you can't get anything in too easy.  And once it's
in, you can't do much with it.  Pascal isn't good with letters and it's not
good at all with numbers.  Besides, I made it very picky.  You have to
recompile, recompile, recompile forever.  Ha!  And once you've done something
with the data, you can't get it out."  Wirth started chuckling uncontrollably.
"Philippe has said C is a write-only language - I made Pascal a read-only
language!"  His chuckling turned into hysterical laughter that went on for
several minutes.
     "Of course, some didn't get the joke," he finally said when he could speak
again.  "They kept trying to make Pascal actually useful.  But I stopped them;
I made the original Pascal a standard.  That meant anyone who made Pascal good
for anything was nonstandard and out on a limb!"

                           *  *  *  *  *

     How will all this affect the future of Modula-2?  Wirths' merry manner
and beaming face suddenly became hard when presented with this question;
perhaps this was taboo territory, sacred subject matter.
     "Modula-2 is a real language," he finally said, his demeanor solemn.  "It
represents a serious effort on my part to make amends for any damage caused by
well-meaning but unimaginative people teaching and learning Pascal.
     "But it's so hard!  Pascal is a very good joke, yes?  But to make a really
good language from it is not so easy," he sighed.
     In addition to Pascal, Wirth admitted, three other languages also were
intended as pranks: Forth, PL/I, and True BASIC.
     "Forth is essentially black humor," Wirth said.  "Charles Moore [who
created the language in the late 1960s] designed it as a native language for
people whose brains ran backward."  Originally, he continued, it was supposed
to be the ultimate parody of Hewlett-Packard calculators, which Moore has been
competing with unsuccessfully for years.  As an astronomer, he had used HP's
calculators out of necessity rather than any appreciation for their design.
But to his great surprise, he found that there were actually quite a few
people whose brains did run in reverse.  Eventually, Moore came to see Forth
as a boon, especially for backward thinkers.  "At least it keeps them of the
streets out of really serious trouble," Wirth said.  "Imagine one of them
trying to drive a car or operate heavy machinery!"
     PL/I originally stood for "Prostituted Language/Interface," Wirth
explained.  "The designers were under so much pressure to add features and
include every possible construction from every other language in existence that
they eventually gave up and decided to play the whole thing for laughs.  They
said 'yes' to every request, no matter how absurd, and even added things to
the language no one ever could or would use.  The scoured journals for
off-beat syntax and weird symbolic notation; some of their better ideas came
from early editions of The Mad Reader and other E. C. publications.  Besides,
several of them were upset with the compiler-writing team and decided to stick
it to them with a life-time project."
     True BASIC is not "True" in the sense most people understand the word,
Wirth continued.  Rather, "True" is itself an acronym for a "Totally wRecked-Up
Example of."  The professors who came up with it are amazed that no one has
yet caught on to the joke; they felt sure their insistence on the LET keyword
would be a dead giveaway.  "Of course there were other clues, but this was the
most clear-cut," Wirth said.  "They even called Microsoft BASIC a street
BASIC in hopes that Bill Gates would challenge them and reveal the joke."
But Gates refused to play along, and both professors had to all but beg Wirth
to tell the world the truth about True BASIC before things went any further.

                            *  *  *  *  *

     Jokes abound in the world of operating systems as well, according to
Wirth.  In addition to the UCSD Pascal operating system, said Wirth, "Tandy,
Apple, and Commodore were for a number of years carrying out a private comedic
battle to see who could produce the world's funniest DOS."
     Tandy's TRS-DOS (Tandy Radio Signal Detection Operating System - a
reference to the fact that early machines would reboot when any transmitted
signal was detected) was an early front-runner until Apple came out with the
vary amusing Control-D command what could enable or disable disk operations.
In the end, though, Commodore won the battle.  Its DOS was oriented toward
records exactly the size of punch cards and took over four minutes to boot from
disk since it read disk data more slowly than most audio tape machines and even
some 300-baud modems.
     But the funniest joke of all is, in Wirth's estimation, also the most
common, and he's amazed so few people have caught on to it yet.
     "Come on, come on.  Surely you can guess," he said, his voice rising in
excitement.  "What one thing makes users more livid than any other? What one
computer product makes you feel sure it was produced by a team of trained
gerbils on mind-altering drugs?  Yes, yes, yes! You see it now - manuals!"
     Wirth considers Gates, who wrote all the BASIC manuals and who was on the
staff of many others, a "comic genius."  "Mitch Kapor should get more
recognition - he's far better than Neil Simon. And what's-his-name, the guy
who wrote the WordStar manual - he got an award at at dinner we threw for
him a few years back.  That manual is a classic in the truest Marxist
[brothers] sense of the word!  Pure slapstick!  But the best of them all is the
author of the dBase II manual.  Now there is a writer for the ages!"
     As for the IBM manuals, Wirth considers them mere hack work.  "Anyone can
do stuff like that," he snorted.
     But perusing a copy of the manual for NEWDOS, he seemed a little more
impressed.  "Hmmmm.  Not bad work.  Not bad at all," he said.  "But it's still
simple stuff.  'To do this, read page 40.  But to know what's on page 40, you
have to read page 65, which refers to page 15, which shows a whole list of
exceptions for page 53.'  Entertaining, but hardly in the class of any of the
modern masters of the art."  But when his attention was brought to the fact
that none of the error numbers listed in the NEWDOS manual were ever returned
to the BASIC programmer, and that the most common disk setup (double-density,
double-sided) was not on the configuration menu, Wirth admitted that these were
indeed nice touches.
     Although it is a known fact that most of the early computer manuals
(probably even the NEWDOS manual) were written by programmers and that
programmers are notoriously poor writers, Wirth would not be deterred from his
opinion that these writings are works of art.
     "Most people fail to consider that good programmers are very bright.
Their thoughts are extremely well organized and most of them have the benefit
of higher education.  Their brains are not warped by overexposure to TV and
their attention spans are not short-circuited by overindulgence in sex, drugs,
or alcohol.  They are not constrained by conventionality.  If you want to get
picky, there are a lot more programmers than there ever were writers.  And
programmers simply work harder than writers.  Few writers work 100 hours a
week; almost all programmers do."
     The result, according to Wirth?  "All programmers write at least as well
as Faulkner.  Most are as good as Proust, and about a third are as good as
Dickens.  Several hundred are at least as good as Shakespeare.  So the manuals
you thought were inferior were simply beyond your poor ability to appreciate.
If you were a programmer, you would delight in their verbal virtuosity," he
said.
     In fact, Wirth claimed, even the grammatical errors and misspellings in
the manuals were placed there deliberately.  Most are elaborate literary
allusions and puns; some are inventive Joycean neologisms.  As an example,
Wirth discussed the history of the word "kernal."
     "Everyone, including programmers, knows the word is spelled k-e-r-n-e-l,"
he explained.   "The deliberate misspelling is an implied criticism of the
typesetter (a writer's bane for years.)  Of course typesetters kern the letter
l; thus, 'kern el.'   But kerning can only be done for certain letter
combinations, such as two l's.  Thus, 'kern a l' dares the typesetter to kern
an isolated l, an obvious typographic impossibility.
     "Moreover," he continued, "'kernal' is an anagram for 'rankle,' which
describes programmers' feelings toward typesetters.  Finally the inventor of
this particular word, R. K. Lane (who is well known within the Southern
California computer community) has concealed his name by means of yet another
anagram."
     Wirth smiled a last secretive smile, leaving us all to wonder if this was
perhaps just one more in his series of personal computer pranks.

      RESIDENTS OF a Texas town had a high time for a day when the wind
    shifted  as sheriff's deputies burned 500 pounds of confiscated
    marijuana in a nearby field.
      "It was weird, but it was great," says Deputy Wilson Vernon.
    "everyone was mellow.  The only problem we had was controlling the rush
    on the diner and the convenience stores."
      Some residents of the town of Moses Rose, especially business people,
    have asked the board of supervisors to make the burning of marijuana an
    annual event.
      "It was wonderful for business," says Harry Grogan, manager of the
    local supermarket.
      "People got the munchies and there was a run on almost everything
    from chocolate chip cookies to ice cream.  A lot of people couldn't
    wait to get through the checkout line.  They ate as they waited."
      Belle Nolan, owner of Belle's Diner, says: "It was a madhouse.  We
    ran out of hamburger meat in an hour.  I had to send a waitress to the
    supermarket to restock on ice cream -- but there wasn't much left by
    that time."
      The only local businesses to suffer were the two bars and a liquor
    store.
      Deputy Vernon says the large cache of marijuana had been confiscated
    over the previous 12 months.  "Some of the farmers supplement their
    regular crops with marijuana," he says.
      "They grow it between rows of corn, where it's hard to spot.
    Usually, we just go in and rip up the plants and store them in garbage
    bags as evidence."
      Once the growers have been convicted and fined, the bags are held
    until there's enough for a large burning.
      "Normally, we pick a day to burn when the wind isn't blowing.  This
    year, however, the wind picked up out of the Gulf and sent heavy clouds
    of smoke over Moses Rose," Vernon explains.

Subj:   You aren't ready for this

At Toys 'R Us, here's a klassy updating of the boring old Statue of
Liberty that didn't move at all:

                            LIBERTY ROCKS!

&gt;From the package:

"Give us Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Hungry ... AND LET THEM ROCK!

"Liberty is energized for the 90s! Because now, the symbol for Freedom
and Democracy has recognized the new Declaration of ROCK! ... which
protects your Right to ROCK!!

"Frederick A. Bartholdi, her original creator, would be proud! ...
Because even though she's 100 years old, LIBERTY ROCKS (TM) SHAKES,
RATTLES, AND ROLLS with ROCKIN', BENDIN', DANCE MOTION.

"LIBERTY ROCKS celebrates the spread of democracy!"

To achieve this effect, you pop a couple of batteries into the Beacon
of Freedom, put 'er next to a radio, pump up the volume -- and Miss
Liberty starts swaying to the funky music!

        It's been necessary to say this a couple of times this week to
        some folks I work with, so it's on my mind and I'll say it to you
        too:

        Take care of your family.  You can let anything else go hang, but
        be sure you take care of yourself and your immediate family.
