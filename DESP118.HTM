                   MOST DEVESTATING BLOW TO DEC
                  SINCE THE RISE AND FALL OF TRAX

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I came to DEC on a contract that expired February 29, 1978.  1978 was
no leap year, but I really thought I'd be here until that date came
around.  It looks like I was wrong.

On March 11, exactly seven years and eleven days after I went direct
at Digital, I will be starting all over at Symbolics.  That I should
announce such a thing in Desperado #1107 seems ineluctable, and even
rather obvious.  I mean, talk about symbolics!

Wow.  Where to start?

Firstly, I am making arrangements to turn the Desperado list over to
some worthy desperados who will doubtless change things around to suit
themselves.  All mail to me will be forwarded to them when I go.

Secondly, I will continue to make contributions via Arpa, and I'll
also open up Desperado shop on the Arpanet myself.

Thirdly, the archives will be maintained, probably better than I
ever have; I'll be taking a copy with me so I can do the greatest hits
album.

Fourthly, AUTHOR::MCGOWAN is trying to do something about a party.
He'll send mail to the list.

Wow.  Where to start?

        'In Paris they simply stared when I spoke to them in French;
         I never did succeed in making those idiots understand their
         language.'

                                                Mark Twain

I hold the championship for fewest interviews prior to DEC hiring.  I
didn't even have to go to Marlboro, where they keep platoons of people
solely for interviewing new hires.  I had exactly one five-minute
chat, with Don Van Volkenburg.  I said 'I've done all kinds of work,
digging ditches, loading fertilizer.'  He said, 'You'll fit right in
here.'  He was right.

I'd always jumped jobs every four or five years.  The jobs always had
some writing in them, but I stayed on the move.  Three days after I
started at DEC, I was sure I was in for a much longer run

My first work was on RSX-11M V3.0, but my first real involvement came
with RSX-11M-Plus V1.0.  I had the odd pleasure of working on a quiet
well-organized project while its siamese twin, Trax V1.0, was darting
and diving all over the lot.  You could tell the Trax people from the
M-Plus by the worried looks on their faces.  Trax was supposed to be
60 per cent of the company's business.  It turned out to be 60 per
cent of the lawsuits, but no per cent of the business.

My first big job was the M-Plus DCL manual and with the encouragement
of the developer, Mike Fox, I plunged pretty deep into making DCL on
RSX bear some relationship to VMS DCL and vice versa.  Chip Groder of
SQM (then a summer hire) joined in the fun and before you knew it, we
were close to compatible.  Everyone knows 'close to compatible' is
pretty damn far, but it used to be a lot worse, and we had a lot of
fun  It only took two full releases, but by that time we had DCL (and
help files) on RSX-11M too.

RSX was like it's supposed to be at DEC, definite bottom-up
management.  We made decisions in consultation with ourselves and
confirmed them with management only on the most superficial level,
such as 'We're looking into compatibility.'

RSX was (is) notoriously a thorny system.  We all laughed when the
product manager suggested 'Easy-M' and we did nothing with the idea at
the time. (Is there anywhere in DEC that product managers manage
products? (Rhetorical question:  I certainly don't want to know about
it. (Probably in a a location code starting with M.)))

Still, there were a few of us in RSX who thought that RSX could be
tamed and sold as a commercial time-sharing system and when the LCP5
came along, we got real interested.  I had been offered a job with Pro
clusters when I suddenly got pulled aside and asked if I thought I
could talk the RSX group into doing a micro version of RSX for the
LCP5 (Micro/PDP-11).  I said yes, did talk them into it, and we all
had a hell of a time.  We did the whole product inside the RSX group
except for a designer who listened to what we had to say and then did
it.

There were no overhead artists whatsoever on the project.  The product
manager, the CSSE person, the program managers, the writers, the
developers, all got caught up in it and went for it.  There wasn't a
suit in sight.  We tossed out Sysgen and MCR - the two most
distinctive and notorious features of RSX - with hardly a second
thought.  As part of our planning, we cooked up a dummy SPD in
December.  In January a year later, the same SPD was printed up and
packed with the product.

(I'm not going to be able to name everybody I was proud to work with
at DEand I'm not even going to try, but the development project leader
on Micro/RSX was Jane Lawler, and I'm really proud I worked with her.)

I spent the next year in a project that was everything Micro/RSX was
not.  So there I was, hanging around, waiting for Godot, when along
comes Symbolics (in the person of the notorious Tokio Rose, for
Desperados who remember) and suddenly, I was no longer waiting for
Godot, I was running off to join the carnival instead.

In the meantime, I had had just about as much fun as it's possible to
have at DEC, not only in my work, but in the Desperado business as
well.  I started it with the idea of bringing the wider world to the
attention of my fellow workers and soon discovered that the wider
world was all around me inside DEC.

So, to raise the question that quivers on every lip:  What does my
departure say about DEC?

How can I give a good answer to that?  In the first place, Symbolics
is in Cambridge and DEC is in the country.  Some of the best stuff in
DEC is out in the woods somewhere and I need a little city life.

In addition to the usual sordid reasons, one impulse that put me in
the computer business was the feeling that communication and knowledge
and language itself were changing, and Lisp and artificial
intelligence, on hardware designed to fit the software is all about
that kind of change.  (Desperado, too).  Besides, their user stuff is
hotter than anything I've seen anywhere.

Finally, in addition to Tokio Rose (Tom Diaz), the very first
Desperado (Jon Ostrowsky) is at Symbolics.  Old friends and people I
always wanted to work with.

So, are all the good people leaving DEC?  I don't think so.  I can name
a few who left and dozens upon dozens who are still here.  It is part
of DEC's role to populate the small companies all around, where there
are always VAXes.

Nobody leaves DEC to go to IBM.  There is still a DEC style and I
think part of that style is to be ready for that interesting offer
from outside when it comes along.

Another part of that style is to say 'Until we meet again' when you
leave.

So, see you at the party, and, after that, 'until we meet again'

Another famous one is "volitile".  This appears throughout the comments
of some bits of one our better known operating systems.  I don't like to
say who perpetuated it, but it didn't save any space...

One that really gets me (although it's more a "vocabulo" than a "spello")
is "alternate" for "alternative", e.g. "alternate representative",
"alternate character set".  This misusage is common in one of our better-
known competitor's manuals.  Maybe it's just American English, I don't know.

"Media" is really a lost cause, and in the last ten years I've decided
that only pedants worry about it.  Like "data", which of course is the
plural of "datum".  You occasionally find people who treat data as a
plural instead of a collective noun.  Just turn left at the dodo and go
right past the pteranadon.

"Christal" is the name of the shipping firm we use here in Reading.  It
was started by someone called Chris... I wince every time I see their
vans, I even have one of their labels on a box in my office for when I
get complacent.

If you've ever been to Decus,you've had your fill of the singular noun
'symposia', from a load of linguistic ignorama, but I think 'data' is
just a collective noun now and singular as can be.  Of course, it's
all a matter of taste and custom.  In England - birthplace of the
tongue - collective nouns seem to be treated as plural, such as 'The
band are not quite right'.

Just think, I'll never have to go to another Decus!

From:   LYRA::MIDDLETON
To:     AUTHOR::PARMENTER
Subj:   RUNOFF and punctuation.

    According to the Harbrace College Handbook (which I consulted because I
didn't want to entirely trust my memories of a typing class I took about twenty
years ago), these are the rules for spacing after punctuation:

    o  One space after commas and semicolons.
    o  One or two spaces after colons.
    o  Two or three spaces after periods, questions marks, and exclamation
       points.

    Also, I checked RUNOFF and it uses one space after commas and semicolons,
and two after colons, periods, question marks, and exclamation points.  Seems
to me that it's working fine.

It was a typing class about 20 years ago that led to my life in
high-tech.  I had been working as a police reporter and rewrite man
for Chicago's American, the city's fourth leading daily, and I was
tired of typing with two fingers and turning my neck to read my notes,
so I decided to take typing at the Downtown Y.  It was such a kick in
the head being back in a classroom again after five years that I
snooped around and found a charity that wanted to educate newspaper
reporters and went back to college on them.  For the record, I was a
Sage Fellow.  The fellowship had me in school half time and ghostwriting
for sociology professors and doing some reporting the rest of the
time.  I covered the riots in Detroit in 1967.  I was supposed to find
Detroit sociology professors who understood all about riots - we were
a sociology magazine - but all the sociology professors were at their
summer homes, so I ended up interviewing rioters instead.  Much more
interesting.  That was my last real reporting work.  I was called east
to ghostwrite at Harvard, which led to a number of technical sounding
items on my resume, which led to my epic at DEC.

Speaking of epics and typing, the last Desperado should have been
numbered 1106.

Subj:   The Tesla saga continues...

These are excerpts from an article on page 1 of the Boston Sunday Globe
of January 13, 1985, titled "Mystery cloud baffles scientists"
---

Shortly after 1 p.m. last April 9, Capt. Charles H. McDade, pilot of Japan
Airlines Flight 36 from Tokyo to Anchorage, was flying off the northern
coast of Japan when he put in a Mayday call to Anchorage:

"We have a ... round ball cloud ... looks like a nuclear explosion, only
there was no lightning, but the cloud was there very definitely ... We're
at altitude 33,000 feet -- the cloud continues to explode like a great
big cloud, easy to see ... and it expanded very rapidly ... I turned off
course to get away from it as much as possible ... We are on hundred percent
oxygen just as a precatution ..."

McDade was not alone.  At about the same time, four other airline pilots
in the area reported seeing the same huge mushroom cloud rise to a height
of 60,000 feet in two minutes.

The pilots, fearing they were witnessing a nuclear explosion, reported
the sighting and, upon landing, had their planes checked for radioactivity.

None was discovered.

[many paragraphs deleted]

"Wild speculation" is the kind of language that mainstream scientists use
to characterize a theory about the cloud being promoted by two former military
officers, Thomas E. Bearden, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, and Dr.
Stefan Possony, a former Air Force intelligence officer.  They believe
the cloud is evidence that the Soviets are testing a new type of beam weapon
unknown to US scientists and researchers.

The 54-year-old Bearden, who worked on high-energy lasers and did analyses
of surface-to-air missilery for the Defense Department, claims the Soviets
are exploiting a branch of physics developed by Nikola Tesla, a contemporary
of Thomas Edison, whose theories on electromagnetism have been largely
dismissed by mainstream physicists.

According to Bearden, who lives in Huntsville, Ala., and currently works
on weapons analysis and artificial intelligence systems for a private
contractor, two electromagnetic beams can be calibrated in such a way that
at their intersection they can create enormous amounts of directed energy.

He contends these "scalar" waves can be manipulated to inject or extract
energy from the environment, causing explosions, jamming or facilitating
communications, even altering weather patterns by causing high- or low-
pressure areas.

The mushroom cloud sighted off Japan last April was caused, Bearden says,
by a Soviet test of a "Tesla-type" weapon.

Bearden claimed in a telephone interview that he has collaborated with
a physicist to create a prototype of a Tesla-beam weapon.  "We can create
a hot or cold spot at a distance of three to four meters away from the
lab bench, which proves the mechanism in principle," he said.  he added
that the physicist declined to be identified because he is awaiting publication
of a paper about his work in a scientific journal.

[several paragraphs deleted]

"There is absolutely no credence to that Tesla stuff," said Dr. Richard
Garwin, a weapons analyst with IBM in New York.

Added Dr. Kosta Tsipis, an MIT arms specialist:  "Bearden is off the deep
end."

Prof. Michael McElroy, an atmospheric physicist at Harvard, speculated
in a telephone interview that the sighting probably involved an unusual
pattern of vertical turbulence in the atmosphere that was misinterpreted
by the pilots...

Among my regrets:  I saw a book a couple of months ago called 'The
Tesla Inheritance', one of those paperback thrillers like 'The
Ostermann Weekend', and I didn't buy it.  It was all about how the
Russkis were trying to get hold of Tesla's papers, which were full of
secret weapons like the above.

On Friday, March 1, the DECBIGBAND will perform on behalf of Oxfam-America
at a concert/dance at the Sheraton-Boxboro hotel. All proceeds from admissions
will be donated to help alleviate famine in the world. The price of admission
is $5.00 per person, at the door (no advanced sales). The capacity of the
ballroom, according to the Sheraton management, is 300, so there should be
plenty of room.

The concert/dance will be held in the Grand Ballroom, starting at 8:30. For
those who have never been to the Sheraton-Boxboro, it's located at the inter-
section of Routes 495 and 111 (in Boxboro, Mass). It has a very good restau-

The immense project also gives some clues to where personal computing may
be headed.

Soon after it is released in book form in 1987, according to a report in
PC Magazine, the complete one-gigabyte dictionary could become available
on two 4.72-inch compact optical disks, which, rumor has it, may be the
IBM microstorage format of the near future.

RSX-11M-PLUS update E was put on hold in the SDC earlier this week. The
reason? A problem a customer found with the update documentation. Seems that
his copy, in lieu of a back cover, had a sheet of question cards from
"Gay Trivia".

Here are the questions we can remember from the card:

        Whose mother said "My son couldn't be gay, it's against
        his religion"?

        What time do the bars close in New York?

        Who is the official mascot of Gay Trivia?

I, uh, had to look up all the answers on the back of the card. Well, I may
have known when the bars close.

        Is there any explanation on how that might have happened?

        I'll &lt;WAG&gt; on the mascot question: Liberace

Liberace is not correct.

Apparently the vendor of the covers also prints Gay Trivia, and a few pieces
of cardboard got slipped. Just think of the bunch who opened up their gay
trivia game only to find RSX-11M-PLUS update notes.

Having  far  to much to read already (what with USENET newgroups and all), I
don't   subscribe  to  Desperado  ...  but  my  wife  occasionally  forwards
interesting issues.  Including Jym's BUSY ad.

Just  thought  you  might  want  to  know  that  Desperado  appears to be an
effective  place  to advertise -- I've already gotten several requests along
the lines of "I saw the ad for BUSY in Desperado -- please send it to me".

I  don't  mind handling individual mail requests, but on the other hand, you
DID start this, and I'm "busy" enough already, so if'n you want to, Tom, you
might as well include some more stuff in your next issue:

If you'd like it, you can copy the installation procedure from

ORAC::BUSY$KIT:BUSY.KIT

It's a DCL command procedure -- just '@' it, and it'll ask where you want it
installed.  You can type a directory name, to install it privately (for your
own use), or if you have privileges (CMKRNL and SYSPRV), and if you are the
system manager or have permission from said individual to mess with the system,
you can type the word "SYSTEM" to install BUSY system-wide (you can also
type the logical name for a rooted directory to install it on [SYSEXE],
[SYSLIB], and [SYSHLP] on that root -- like "SYS$COMMON").  The installation
includes BUSY.INS, which is release notes and miscellaneous information, and
BUSY.MAN which is the users guide (you can copy either or both first, if you'd
like, to see what it does -- they're on the same directory).

Also, if you'd like some alternate picture files (you'll know what that means
after reading the manual!), there's a library on the rooted directory

ORAC::BUSY$PICTURES:[{DECCRT|REGIS}]

(use the directory name corresponding to the terminal you use -- [DECCRT] or
[REGIS]).

A (very) basic feature summary for BUSY V4.1:

1. Displays information on your terminal while you're gone -- a "reason" string
   which you specify, a return time, when you left, a picture, and some misc.
   information.

2. Someone can walk into your office, see where you are, and if they wish, the
   display instructs them in how to leave a message for you (pretty easy).

3. Any broadcast messages will be stored -- a counter is always shown on the
   screen, so you know how many messages you've gotten.

4. BUSY will not exit until you enter your password (which can be entered
   manually -- noecho -- when BUSY starts, or can be stored in a logical name
   created by BUSY in encrypted format).  There is no way (without extreme
   privileges and some ingenuity, anyway) that BUSY can be forced to return
   your process to DCL, without your password (obviously, the security of
   the password itself is your problem, just as for VMS login passwords).

5. BUSY has a "message board" file -- your name, reason, the time you left and
   the time you plan to return are entered in the message board; anyone with
   BUSY and read access to the file can read the message board and see where
   you've gone -- even from another DECnet node.

So, this is not the last Desperado.  It's not even my last Desperado
while at Digital.  Is it the end of innocence?  Not even that.
