This is an electronic copy of a letter that I sent to Ken Olsen.
It is an expression of concern over the Digital-Raytheon pact.
Please do not assume that this letter speaks for you.  If you have
similar sentiments you should write your own letter.  I believe such
letters are risk-free.  Ken and the managers under him WANT to know
employee sentiments.  Naturally, one should not be abusive or threatening.

Put yourself in Ken's shoes, imagine his concerns and priorities.
Don't try to tell him how to run the business.  He probably does not
believe that he should use the company to accomplish social/political
aims, so it is probably counterproductive to suggest that he should
use the company to try to effect world peace or nuclear disarmament.

Nevertheless, if your pride in the company and in yourself is affected
by the company's recent decision, then your productivity is affected and
you have a right (perhaps a duty?) to tell Ken.

Here is the letter:

20 August, 1986

Mr. Kenneth Olsen
Digital Equipment Corporation

Dear Mr. Olsen:

I left the Honeywell Corporation in 1973 after ten years there
because the company refused to consider the morality of its
weapons production.  Since then I have worked for Digital, first
as an employee, then (after moving to Connecticut) as a contractor.
I have always considered Digital to be "my" company.

I am proud of my association with Digital, its people, its
products, its sales methods, etc.  I am most proud of the fact
that Digital's success was achieved outside the weapons industry.

I always held up Digital as the counterargument when cynics
claimed that defense work was unavoidable, that everyone did it,
that one could not afford to be "righteous" except on a subsistence
commune in Virginia.

So for me and many others the front page of DTW bears sad news today.
I have heard people talking of "having dirty hands," of a sense of
powerlessness.  A coworker cried.

I am wondering if the agreement with Raytheon can't be reversed.
I believe that news of such a reversal, properly made, could
enhance sales, would renew employee pride, and would guarantee
an endless flow of new talent at our doors.

Thank you for listening.

William Kohlbrenner

Digital has a reputation as an ethical company. We don't deal even indirectly
with South Africa, for example. We used not to deal with defense contracts.
If you care about that ethical reputation, if the way we do business matters
to you, you could do worse than follow VAXUUM::KOHLBRENNER's example.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - United Parcel Service employees discovered
12 human heads when they opened a package because it was leaking,
and the FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken.
   A doctor in Philadelphia said he shipped the heads to a medical
training facility in Colorado, according to an official in
Philadelphia.
   The physician should find another method of shipment, Jefferson
County Coroner Richard Greathouse said Wednesday.
   ``We do not think that personnel of carriers ... such as UPS ...
should be subjected to having to handle body parts such as heads
without being assured they are protected from any type of infectious
disease in the handling of these body parts,'' he said.
   In addition, UPS should have notified local authorities
immediately after learning of the heads, instead of simply repacking
them and sending them on their way to Colorado, the coroner said.
   ``Any agency in this county that encounters a dead body or parts
of dead bodies that they can't account for ought to notify the
coroner's office. We have to identify these things to make sure
somebody's not killing somebody,'' Greathouse said.
   The FBI learned of the heads this week, said FBI spokesman Phil
Doty, who would not say how the agency found out. He said the FBI is
investigating to determine if any federal laws have been violated
and how the heads were obtained.
   Matt Vaughn, a loss-prevention supervisor on the night shift, was
the only UPS official who could be reached for comment Wednesday
night. He said he knew nothing about the incident.
   Philadelphia police Capt. Robert Grasso said the heads were
shipped by a Dr. Martin Spector.
   Grasso said, ``There is no reason to believe that any homicides
were involved and we are not pursuing that angle.''
   Dr. Halbert Fillinger, an assistant medical examiner in
Philadelphia, said the doctor told police that he got the heads from
a pathologist's assistant. There was no immediate comment from
Spector; he did not return calls from The Associated Press today.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A physician who used UPS to ship the heads of
12 cadavers to a research center had eight pairs of frozen human
ears in his office, police said.
   The ears, found at the office of Dr. Martin Spector, were taken
to the police crime lab, said homicide Detective Robert Lagera. He
declined further comment.
   District Attorney Ron Castille said Thursday that Spector, a
specialist in the treatment of illnesses of the eye, ears, nose and
throat, told police he had been shipping body parts for 15 years.
   ``We think the heads are probably taken after the body is used
for medical training but before it is properly disposed of,''
Castille said.
   The heads were not thought to be those of homicide victims, said
police Capt. Robert Gasso.

Subj:   For Desperado - "What's Your Song?"

The latest in fortune-telling techniques has hit the press. An article
in the Nashua "Telegraph" describes a gentleman named Sherman Cohen,
the program and operations director for radio stations KKLZ and KRAM in
Las Vegas, who has begun using "musicology" to tell people about
themselves - using the songs that were #1 on the Billboard magazine
charts on their birthdays.

"It pretty much works like astrology, the belief that the lineup of
planets have an effect on your behavior," he says. "It's the same
thing with musicology. But it's not just a song that was popular on
your birthday that affects your life. It's the hit songs on every
birthday after that."

The newspaper article goes on:

    Not surprisingly, he has no competition.

    "I've never met anyone else who does this. One thing people don't
    realize is that God stops you from making money on things that are
    psychic. You can only do it to help people."

    He offered some examples of songs and what they say about the
    personalities born when they were popular. The explanations seemed
    somewhat basic.

    For example, "Young Love" (March 2-29, 1957) characterizes someone
    prone to marrying young; "Mr. Postman" (Dec. 11-17, 1961, and Jan.
    25-31, 1975) means the person corresponds a lot; those born under the
    sign of "Quarter to Three" (June 26-July 9, 1961) are night owls, and
    if "All I Have to Do is Dream" (May 12-June 8, 1958) was your birth
    song, you have a vivid imagination and "live in lah-lah land," said
    Cohen.

    Death records such as "Teen Angel," "Big Bad John" and "Leader of the
    Pack" are bad news.

    Then there are those born under the influence of novelty songs. (Can
    you imagine "What's your song?" replacing "What's your sign?" As in:
    "Well, I'm an 'Alley Oop' with 'Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka
    Dot Bikini' rising.")

    Those people are irreverent and off the wall, Cohen claimed.

(Okay, I'll bite. Anybody know what was at the top of the charts on
April 29, 1952?)

Subj:   COLLECTED INFO ON TUITION REIMBURSEMENT

First I am going to give the information that I have collected on the
blood-boiling matter of tuituion reimbursement - then into MY reason
for anger at the situation.  Oh, this information is kindness of a
memo issued by my father's place of employment -- never got the scoop
around here.

Originally, corporations were able to provide tuition assistance to
employees under Section 127 of the Tax Code.  This section allowed
employees to receive up to $5,000 of tuition assistance annually, tax-
free.  As of January 1, 1986, these programs fall under Section 162 of
the tax code.  Under this section, any tuition assistance which is not
job-related must be treated as additional compensation to the employee.

So, you can see that the corporations have been put on the spot actually.
The real furor should be directed to whomever or whatever decided to
play checkers with the section under which this assistance falls.

My suggestion is to sit down with your manager and seriously address the
courses that are being taken and see if they fall in the job-related
range.  If they are, you proceed as before.  There are new forms for the
Application for Education and Training.  This form outlines the codes
that your classes can fall under for taxable and non-taxable.

Now for my editorial comments:

I feel that these games are being played by people in Washington who never
have and never will have to worry as to where the money will come to
educate themselves or their children.  To say that this galls me is an
understatement.  One fellow employee made the statement, "Letters on this
issue won't make much of a difference because the percentage of people who
are hit is too small."  Obviously, this is true!

My other teeth-grinding observation is that the government is all in a
bubble over whether are going to be beaten out by Japan technically.  Well,
HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE EVER GOING TO COMPETE UNLESS WE ARE EDUCATED!!!!!!
They make it harder every year for our young people to get an education.
Now they are trying to make it economically prohibitive for those people
who could ONLY afford higher education by going through programs such as
this to do so!

Now that I have thoroughly irritated myself, I'll get back to work.  Hope
I have shed some light on the reasons for the new rules and given some
helpful info on how to address them.

      BUTTON PROGRAM, BUTTON PROGRAM, WHO'S GOT THE BUTTON PROGRAM?

Subj:   More button quotes than you could ever need.  Now in program form!

Spurred on by the most recent issue of Desperado,  I thought I'd send
in a copy of a program that prints out sayings once every time you run it.
This is generally know in Arpanet circles as a Cookie program, as in the
sayings you get from Chinese fortune cookies.  This is the kind of program
to run in your LOGIN file.

Well after much suggesting from me, Cathy Bence had the fortitude to type
in most of Nancy Lebowitz's huge button catalogue.  She made it into a
simple text array in the program.  The more technically inclined, do this
with a data file, but what the heck.

I should explain a little about the Button Catalog,  Nancy sells buttons
and Science Fiction conventions.  The material is drawn from the suggestions
of the people (she makes custom buttons to order)  and often some buttons
lead to others.  The subject matter is drawn from SF, Fantasy, D&amp;D, Gaming,
Films, and other obvious misc subjects.

The programs are in

BERGIL::MITTON's original message included hundreds of lines of C program,
and I duly extracted it, edited out a few of the dozens of typos (sorry,
Cathy, I calls 'em as I sees 'em), compiled it and ran it. And ran it,
and ran it, and ran it again. Addictive as M&amp;Ms, it is. Here's a random

From RISKS-FORUM Digest, Thursday, 14 August 1986, Volume 3 : Issue 37:

------------------------------

Below are extracts from two reports in the Guardian; the first rather jokey
and the second less so, presumably after the journalist realised the
seriousness of the problem.

      Exploding chairs a pain in the office

    A new hazard at work, the exploding office chair, is facing - or, rather,
  the reverse - Britain's white collar workers.  The problem is now under
  investigation so that up to 2 million minds, and a similar number of
  bottoms, may rest more easily.  So far, 11 swivel chairs around the country
  are known to have gone off with a bang.  In three cases the exploding chairs
  have caused injury, probably because the sitters have been sent sprawling as
  the bottom drops out of their world.

    The problem has cropped up with adjustable office chairs fitted with
  nitrogen gas cylinders in place of the conventional springs in their height
  control mechanism.  Preliminary findings suggest that metal fatigue cracks
  can develop in the cylinders, possibly caused by the poor chairs being asked
  to cope with more than they can bear.

      Exploding chairs' two-year history (Tuesday, 12th August 1986)

    The danger of office chairs exploding has not previously been made public
  because of official reluctance to raise an "alarmist scare," it emerged
  yesterday.  The public has not been warned about blasts scattering stell
  fragments and metal bolts caused by failures in adjustable chairs fitted
  with nitrogen cylinders instead of conventional springs. Cases of serious
  injury came to light two years ago. ...

    In September 1984, the Consumers' Association passed to the Health and
  Safety Executive (HSE) details reported by consumer organisations in Europe
  of incidents involving office chairs.  They included accounts of two deaths,
  one in Belgium and the other in West Germany, where, it was reported, a
  piece of steel had penetrated a victim's brain through the eye.  ....  The
  HSE has stressed that only 11 incidents, three of which caused injury, are
  known to have occurred in Britain - where up to 2 million of the chairs are
  in use.

Has this story broken in the US yet? How many of you are sitting at your VDU
on such a chair? This is the time to take a quick peek below you, and take
appropriate defensive action if necessary. You have been warned!

                         [Some persons talked into buying this chair
                          were evidently given a bum steer!  PGN]

My dear brother used to work for a very flossy Washington, D.C. law firm
before he took up the professorial hustle. There was a state-of-the-art
conference room at the head office, with teak panelling, a bar that
bordered fantasy, a view of the seats of power (sorry) and a long table
surrounded by these magical chairs. Spent an entire evening sitting at this
table with my bro and his wife, and my own dear husband, discussing
epistemology, George Stubbs, and chocolate ice cream, and riding these
chairs up into the air and slowly, thanks to modern technology, down to
the ground again. But then I love to live dangerously.

"Minor bug starts mass beer panic"
by Dave Holmes (c) Datalink

A holidaying programmer sparked off a bizarre series of events last week
culminating in a rumour that Tetley's, Yorkshire's most famous brewery, had
stopped production.  Workmates had realised that they needed the advice of
the programmer, Richard Chubb, to sort out a problem with the control system
he was developing for Tetley.  Police were asked to help track him down on
holiday in Scotland, but a telex from Strathclyde police to seven Scottish
police divisions apparently suggested that the brewery had stopped
production because of a computer breakdown.

News of this got back to Yorkshire and last weekend Tetley was deluged with
calls from worried publicans afraid that supplies of Yorkshire's finest were
about to dry up.  David Gaskill, of the engineering company Turkington which
was installing the control system explained what had happened: "There was a
communications glitch between two systems we are installing at Tetley, and
the program is not fully documented yet. To go through the code was going to
take ages, but Richard could have sorted it out in 20 minutes," he said.

The answer to "What color is a chameleon on a mirror?" is obvious.
It becomes transparent.  If you don't believe me check out for
yourself all the chameleons you can't see next time you look in your
bathroom mirror.

You can also experiment by putting one of your kid's chameleons on
the mirror yourself and watching it change.  You may have to wait a
while.  Closing your eyes helps, since chameleons, especially the
females, don't appreciate being watched while they change.  After a
while when you open your eyes you won't be able to see it.  Later
it'll show up again somewhere off the mirror.
