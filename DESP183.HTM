    I was having one of those conversations, explaining computers, and
    came up with this, which is probably not first time anyone said it:

        Software is what the computer seems to be doing.  Hardware is
        what it's really doing.

          and grandchildren

        - war hero

    Speaking of politics, I am absolutely loving the Chinese revolution.

    The people

    Cannot be defeated
    as we used to chant back in the 60s and it certainly seems so.  The
    Workers are protecting the Students by telling the Army "You're the
    People's Army.  You can't attack the people."  And the army says, "Oh,
    yeah, you're right" and turns around. I love the picture of CNN of the
    bakery workers banging on their lard cans.  An early picket sign:
    "Hello, Mr. Democracy!"  All being broadcast live from the Great Wall
    Sheraton and then the scenes of the CNN producer arguing paperwork with
    the Chinese bureaucrats before being tossed off the satellite.

    And best of all, the Chinese revolution came up so fast that it has not
    been processed by the great political think machine so everybody knows
    what to say about it.  I'm very proud to be a democrat this week.

    The whole thing was touched off by Gorby, and I still think he may be
    nuts.  The latest flowering of glasnost:  Protesters in Soviet Georgia
    are attacked with poison gas and *sharpened* shovels, but now we can
    read about it in Pravda instead of some right-wing emigre' rag.

        FROM BEIJING TO CAMBRIDGE, THE CHIMES OF FREEDOM FLASHING

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Desperado is _never_ an official statement of DEC policy, but since the
following announcement comes from a prominent bunch of computer wild men,
none of whom are DEC employees, I thought it would be prudent to mention
the point again.

Newsgroups: gnu.g++
Subject: Porting gcc and g++ to the Macintosh
Date: 20 May 89 16:57:22 GMT
Distribution: gnu
Organization: GNUs Not Usenet

I hope no one ports GCC to the Macintosh; but in any case, we will not
propagate or support such a port.  We are boycotting the Macintosh
system because of Apple's look-and-feel copyright lawsuit.  This is such
a great threat to the future of free software that it is essential to
do everything we can to pressure Apple and form public opinion against
their demands.

The League for Programming Freedom urges all of you to boycott Apple,
Lotus and Ashton-Tate by not buying their products, not developing
software to work with their products, and not working for those
companies.

Here is our latest action:

This Wednesday (MAY 24), the League for Programming Freedom will protest the
look-and-feel copyright demands of Lotus, Apple and Ashton-Tate by
picketing the headquarters of Lotus.  The sponsors of the
demonstration include Guy L. Steele, Jr., Richard Stallman and MIT
Professors Marvin Minsky, Gerald J. Sussman, and Patrick Winston.  If
you want to preserve the freedom to write and use programs of your
choice, join our demonstration!

We will gather at Tech Square in Cambridge (on Main Street near Vassar
Street) shortly before noon on Wednesday May 24, rain or shine.  Go to
the center of Tech Square, between the buildings, where the trees are.
At noon we will march to the Lotus building next to the river at 55
Cambridge Parkway.  If you are late, go directly there.  Don't be too
late, since we will finish at 1pm.

If you work in the suburbs, you can travel back and forth and stay for
the entire demonstration in about 2.5 hours.  That's a long lunch, but
you can get away with it.

Please post copies of this announcement where you work, on bulletin
boards and anywhere else appropriate.  Also speak to your coworkers
and friends about the demonstration; some of them may not read net
    news or bulletin boards.

Since not everyone will make a sign, it is very helpful if you do so.
Here are some suggestions for slogans:
    SAY NO TO MONOPOLY
    KEEP YOUR LAWYERS OFF MY COMPUTER
    BOYCOTT LOTUS
    PROGRAMMERS ARE ANGRY
Use your imagination; the more variety, the better.

We are thinking of returning some used 1-2-3 manuals to Lotus as a
symbolic gesture of rejection of their software.  If you have a manual
you would like to use for this, bring it along.

Once we get to the Lotus building, please remember not to litter, not
to block pedestrians and to stay out of the street.  We want to behave
as responsible citizens of a democratic society and be seen as such.
It's a sure thing there will be lots of reporters covering the first
demonstration ever by programmers about an issue vital to the
programming field.

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Gosh, fellows, those sure are stirring slogans.  I hope you'll be able to
control the crowds.  Here's two slogans for you:

                      MAC IS JUST A LITTLE STAR
                        LOTUS LOVES VISICALC

Everyone should know that the look and feel of the Mac is remarkably
similar to the look and feel of the Xerox Star, right down to the trash
can, I believe, and Lotus 1-2-3, as far as I can tell, just looks like
another spreadsheet and remarkably resembles all the others, including the
original spreadsheet, VisiCalc.

The sponsors of this march include some very prominent maniacs, Stallman
and Minsky in particular, and this could be one entertaining demonstration.

Remember though that Stallman, at least, doesn't think anyone should make
money from software, which would sure ruin my family budget.  Demo, si,
boycott, no.

Message-Id: &lt;19890505072909.1.STRAZ@ZAXXON.MEDIA.MIT.EDU&gt;

The secret of the "world's worst taste" is revealed in US patent
4,652,577.  Atomergic Chemetals in Plainview, NY, were looking for
something even more vile than the compound that held the previous title,
denatonium benzoate. Manufacturers add it to industrial alcohol and
paint, to make it undrinkable. But they wanted something even more foul,
for applications like keeping rats from gnawing through cables.

The new stuff, which is five times as bitter and tastes appalling even
when diluted to 1 part in 100 million, is called denatonium saccharide.
To make it, just dissolve denatonium chloride and sodium saccharide in
water and heat to 60 degrees C. Then you isolate the stuff using
chloroform, to get a fine white powder that's truly revolting.

Dear Mr. Parmenter,

My net correspondent requested that I forward the following to you
for possible inclusion in "Desperado".
I did write it; it did happen to me, so please do not include my
name. Not only do I have to go back to class, but my company (Prime)
is already in enough trouble, and this might totally undermine
confidence.

Hi ho! J. Munson  (munson@en-m20.prime.com)

===================================================================
===================================================================
I'm going through my mail, and cleaning out files, and I came across
a message from you that ended "I think, therefore I'm everything".
I was keeping the message because that phrase reminded me of
something that happened at work that I thought you would like...

I'm in this "management training class" where they are teaching
presentation skills (i.e. how not to look like a nerd, but sound like
one if need be). Anyway, a group of twelve (moi aussi) is seated
around the table and we are asked to "think fast"; the moderator
tosses out a question, and we have to spend two minutes answering it.
The moderator turns to me and says "Think fast: who is the most
influential figure of the twentieth century?" I spend time humming
and hawing why I think Otto Von Bismark is responsible for the
world's current troubles, finally the time keeper shuts me up. The
moderator turns to a young lady across the table from me and says
"Think fast, same question; who is the most influential figure in the
twentieth century?" ...and the nice, college educated lady spends two
entire minutes explaining why HER FATHER is the most influential
figure of the twentieth century...

can you say "no sense of history"?
can you say "no sense of proportion"?
can you say "I think, therefore I am everything"?

Subj:   How say?

Is John R. Covert's name pronounced "cuh-VERT" or "COH-vert"?

(I just read a prescriptive book about pronunciation, called "There is
no Zoo in Zoology", which insists that the word "covert" acquired its
"COH-vert" pronunciation only recently.  The author also claims that
the pronunciation "DES-pic-an-bul" was preferred in the days before
Daffy Duck, and reminds us that the flower name "poin-SET-ee-uh" has
four syllables.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Our publisher pronounces it CO-vert.  According to my dictionary, that is
like the adjective meaning "not open", etc.  There is another word,
cuh-VERT, a noun, meaning "hiding place".  Neither applies to John's
French-nude-beach career, where, contrary to rumor, he did NOT wear his
bermuda shorts and high socks.

Here's a recent communication from John, who so rarely actually *appears*
in Desperado.

&gt;    significant devolution of control outside of the central caucus.

        Is he swearing?  Is he swearing,
        With these words so overbearing?                (apologies to W.S.G.)

/john

Poinsett is someone's name, as is Fuchs (fuchsia) and, amazingly, Garden
(gardenia).

Daffy's speech impediment is nothing compared to Donald's.

Sociological giant Robert Merton wrote a whole book about the derivation of
this phrase.  It turns out, in true medium-is-the-message fashion, that
lots of people stood on the shoulders of giants searching for a memorable
phrase.  That is, Merton traced it back to B.C., if not Alexander the
Great.

Merton didn't have any of these phrases, except Newton's, of course, but I

Subj:   Pseudo-products

[forwarding removed]

An unidentified source at Digital Equipment Corporation has revealed major
DCL-related product announcements scheduled for release on April 1 by the Merry
Mites of Maynard.

The first important revelation is the development of a DEC-supported DCL
compiler.  The source said that the new product, called DCL On-Line Performance
Enhancer, DOPE for short, reads in standard DCL command procedures and
translates them to a variant of VAX-11 BASIC.  The resultant source code then
can be compiled and linked using the new dialect BASIC Adaptive Recombinant
Formatter (BARF).

The source, who refused to be identified, said the most difficult part of the
project was modifying VAX-11 BASIC into the new BARF language.  "DEC software
engineers greatly underestimated the amount of time it would take to remove
floating point capability," he reported.  "Stripping out the ELSE and WHILE
statements was a real bear, too."

In conjunction with the DOPE and BARF releases, the source revealed that DEC
also has added several new lexical functions to the DCL repertoire. Some of the
newer capabilities, which should be incorporated into VMS V4.601, include:

F$ENVIRONMENT("PERFORMANCE")-
This function performs an instant analysis of system performance, using
advanced artificial intelligence techniques.  The unidentified source said that
unlike other lexicals, which use VAX/VMS System Services, this function
actually invokes an expert system developed internally by DEC. "The problem is
that the expert system wasn't written by the VMS team -- it was written by
Sales.  The function always returns the string, 'BUY AN 8800'."

F$GEGDVI("device","LITIGATION")-
"DEC's decided to become even more aggressive in pursuing third-party vendors
who infringe on the VAX BI bus."  This lexical, imbedded in the system startup
command file, polls each device connected to the BI bus to determine if any
"foreign invaders" are on the system.  If non-DEC hardware is discovered, the
system automatically calls out via the RDC line to a team of lawyers on 24-hour
standby at DEC's support site in Colorado Springs.  If the customer hasn't
subscribed to the Remote Diagnostics facility, the system will not boot and
will print out the message "No Hablo Bogus BI" on the console device.

F$GETSYI("LICENSE_POLICY")
The recent controversy over the transfer of VMS licenses has prompted DEC to
reassure some user sites on an almost daily basis.  To reduce costs associated
with the massive influx of calls and letters, DEC added this function to
provide online information about the current VMS licensing policy. Calls to the
function return various string values, including "YES", "NO", "HMM...THAT'S A
GOOD QUESTION", and "KEN WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT."

F$COOKIE()-
The widespread popularity of "Fortune Cookie" software (programs that display
cute messages to users at login) has prompted DEC to provide this built-in
message generation capability.  A sample of the text returned by calls to this
function include "Digital Has It Now (but its on back-order)," "We Don't
Comment on Unannounced Products," "It's Not A Bug, It's A Feature," and "Will
Be Fixed In A Forthcoming Release Of VMS."

In conjunction with the introduction of F$COOKIE(), DEC has announced "Sayings
of Chairman Ken," a new release from Digital Press ($39.95, softcover).

Several major enhancements to VMS security also are upcoming as a result of
DEC's continued success in selling  to various Department of Defense (DoD)
agencies.  In direct response to Pentagon specs, look for an upcoming version
of VMS to contain an /INVISIBLE qualifier to the PRINT command which should
help users protect unauthorized personnel from reading sensitive printouts.
Also, watch for enhancements to the DECtalk interface, including "whisper" and
"mumble" functions.

To further enhance security, all users have NL: as their default device. "It
creates some file maintenance problems," our source revealed, "but the data is
absolutely secure, incremental backups are a snap, and the I/O is too fast to
be believed."

No firm release date has been set for this security package.  "The resulting
systems are so secure, DoD can't figure out how to log in.  DEC's scouring the
hacker BBSs for free-lance consulting help to resolve the problem."

Two other actions planned by DEC, while not directly related to system
operation, also should make life easier for managers and users:

1.  The announcement of a change to a long-rumored policy, whereby DEC will
alter the manner in which it reimburses its technical writers for creating VMS
documentation.  While the new method wasn't revealed, our inside source
confirms that DEC has abandoned its old payment procedure, which was based on
the number of pounds of documentation produced.

2.  The acknowledgement of user unhappiness with constant modification to
various operating systems, high-level languages and layered software products.
DEC therefor, will, at a alight premium, offer to support those sites wanting
to continue operations with "old" software.  Look for a selection box on future
maintenance agreements where users can choose between "New Code" and "Classic
Code."

                        Freud on Seuss
                a book review by Josh LeBeau

_The Cat in the Hat_
by Dr. Seuss, 61 pages.  Beginner Books, $3.95

The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetry
in which the author re-examines the dynamic rhyming schemes and
bold imagery of some of his earlier works, most notably _Green
Eggs and Ham_, _If I Ran the Zoo_, and _Why Can't I Shower With
Mommy?_  In this novel, Theodore Geisel, writing under the
pseudonym Dr. Seuss, pays homage to the great Dr. Sigmund Freud
in a nightmarish fantasy of a renegade feline helping two young
children understand their own frustrated sexuality.

The story opens with two youngsters, a brother and a sister,
abandoned by their mother, staring mournfully through the
window of their single-family dwelling.  In the foreground, a
large tree/phallic symbol dances wildly in the wind, taunting
the children and encouraging them to succumb to the sexual
yearnings they undoubtedly feel for each other.  Even to the
most unlearned reader, the blatant references to the
incestuous relationship the two share set the tone for Seuss'
probing examination of the satisfaction of primitive needs.
The Cat proceeds to charm the wary youths into engaging in
what he so innocently refers to as "tricks."  At this point,
the fish, an obvious Christ figure who represents the
prevailing Christian morality, attempts to warn the children,
and thus, in effect, warns all of humanity of the dangers
associated with the unleashing of the primal urges.  In
response to this, the cat proceeds to balance the aquatic
naysayer on the end of his umbrella, essentially saying,
"Down with morality; down with God!"

After poohpoohing the righteous rantings of the waterlogged
Christ figure, the Cat begins to juggle several icons of
Western culture, most notably two books, representing the Old
and New Testaments, and a saucer of lactal fluid, an ironic
reference to maternal loss the two children experienced when
their mother abandoned them "for the afternoon."  Our heroic
Id adds to this bold gesture a rake and a toy man, and thus
completes the Oedipal triangle.

Later in the novel, Seuss introduces the proverbial Pandora's
box, a large red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One,
or Freud's concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that
serves as the conscious mediator between the person and
reality, and Thing Two, the Superego which functions to reward
and punish through a system of moral attitudes, conscience,
and guilt.  Referring to this box, the Cat says, "Now look at
this trick.  Take a look!"  In this, Dr. Seuss uses the
children as a brilliant metaphor for the reader, and asks the
reader to re-examine his own inner self.

The children, unable to control the Id, Ego, and Superego
allow these creatures to run free and mess up the house, or
more symbolically, control their lives.  This rampage
continues until the fish, or Christ symbol, warns that the
mother is returning to reinstate the Oedipal triangle that
existed before her abandonment of the children.  At this
point, Seuss introduces a many-armed cleaning device which
represents the psychoanalytic couch, which proceeds to put
the two youngsters' lives back in order.

With powerful simplicity, clarity, and drama, Seuss reduces
Freud's concepts on the dynamics of the human psyche to an
easily understood gesture.  Mr. Seuss' poetry and choice of
words is equally impressive and serves as a splendid
counterpart to his bold symbolism.  In all, his writing style
is quick and fluid, making _The Cat in the Hat_ impossible to
put down.  While this novel is 61 pages in length, and one
can read it in five minutes or less, it is not until after
multiple readings that the genius of this modern day master
becomes apparent.

Well, there you have it Desperados, yet another in the never ending series

Next ish reveals the evil designs of Enver Hoxha and could, in fact, be
