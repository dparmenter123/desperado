                             IS IT BLUE?

 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 When I was a reporter (and how I hated to hear those words when I was
 one) black-on-black murders weren't news.  This is in Chicago in
 1962.  When I called in to the city desk with some spectacular
 slaying, the first question I'd get was "Is it blue?" Meaning, is it
 black?  If it was, I'd be lucky to get two paragraphs in the paper,
 no matter how interesting.

 "Mother of 15 kills father of 13 in police station" got two
 paragraphs.  It happened just after I'd left the Maxwell Street
 station to tour the local flophouses where, acting like a cop (a
 rather improbable 22-year-old detective with horn-rimmed glasses, a
 plaid sports jacket and a southern accent), I sought a name to go
 with the naked (white) body that had been found in the forest
 preserve that weekend.

 Meanwhile, back at the station, the cops had brought in the woman as
 a witness to a shooting, she lunged for a gun, the evidence, and shot
 the suspect, who was chained to a chair.  She had 15 children, he had
 13, none by each other.

 I found out about it when I called the station to check in, and
 couldn't get through to the homicide detectives.  I called the
 burglary detectives next door only to find them in high hilarity over
 this event, which they refused to talk about on the phone.  "You'd
 better get down here, hee-hee-hee." I did, and had the scoop.  Two
 paragraphs, and in the afternoon papers only.  The story lacked the
 legs to make the morning papers the next day.  (The dead
 guy in the forest preserve stayed in the news three days.)

 Too bad I wasn't covering it in in 1995, I could have whipped it all
 up into a prestigious journalism award, the cops, their attitudes,
 their laxness (imagine this happening, really), the families of the
 of the mother of 15 and father of 13, the social fabric, the
 Republican agenda, gangs, drugs, rap music.  Nowadays, if it's blue,
 the papers pull out all the stops.

 I don't know what to make of this.  Is there more violence now?  Are
 newspapers better?

         BECKETT, GETS OUT STAINS OTHER CLEANSERS CAN'T TOUCH

 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 I had collected a whole bunch of interesting reactions to my Beckett
 tweak but I lost all but one of them in a mail spasm.  Look what's
 left.

Subject: Re: some words are more of a stain than others

&gt; With a good
&gt; editor, Samuel might have said, reducing the stain, "Every word is a
&gt; stain on silence and nothOBingness.

Nothingness implies silence.  Just ask John Cage.

Me, I just say, "Every." and let the rest be implied.

 I really hated losing all the others (hey, send im again), but don't
 worry, all the mail I got about the VT100 is safe, being digested,
 and will soon be making you long for the return of the carrier pigeon
 (if not the grand old custom of killing the messenger).

 Shortened, but still not succinct, I remain,
