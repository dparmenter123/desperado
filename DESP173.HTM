George Bush has said only three memorable things in his life:

                                voo-doo
                                doo-doo
                                no-new

So that makes him two up on Vice President elect J. Danforth Quayle III.

If that puzzles you, JDQIII's memorable thing was. "I didn't know I'd be
standing in this room today answering questions when I signed up for the
Indiana national guard 20 years ago."

Quayle, by the way, is George Bush's fraternity brother.  They are both
"Dekes", whichever one that is.  They are also both "dorks", if you're
keeping score.

There is a remote possibility that we will not have to suffer Quayle as our
vice president.  Certainly, he is the very model of a vermiform appendix,
but unfortunately in our system the vermiform appendix is promoted to liver
when the liver goes.

But the vice presidency is not the only apparently useless appendage in the
American system.  We also have a funny little number called the Electoral
College.  We didn't elect these two bozos earlier this month, we elected
members of the Electoral College and it's up to the College to elect these
two bozos.  Or . . . *not* elect them.

Yes, the Collegians are completely free to vote for whomever they like.  In
each of the last three elections, one or more members of the Electoral
College have voted for someone other than the person who won the popular
vote in their state.  These defections have survived court challenges.
(The only restriction is that electors may not vote for two people from
their own state.  This sets up the scenario that they vote down both Bush
and Quayle and elect Bentsen, the other Texan.)

In fact, on one occasion, the Electoral College *has* deemed the vice
presidential choice unfit for higher office and refused to vote him in.
When Martin Van Buren was elected, the Electoral College rejected his
running mate.  Since Van Buren was the last sitting vice president to be
elevated to the presidency, the temptation to further the historical Van
Buren parallel might prove overwhelming to the members of the Electoral
College.

(Van Buren's running mate was elected by the Senate, which has an
override, but the Senate is Democratic this year.)

The objection to Quayle is not that he is a cretinous conservative and not
just that he is a moron and not just that he is a moral cipher and not just
that his wife spends all the livelong day listening to audio cassettes by
some antisemitic preacher from Dallas and not just that Teddy Kennedy says
he's smart (It takes one to know one, eh, Fat Boy?) and not just that he
was chosen to make Bush look better and not just to protect Bush from
assassins and impeachers (who will be coming at Bush as soon as the
arms-to-Iran scam comes back to life) and not just that he looks like
Robert Redford without the mole and not just that "Ishtar" was a lousy
movie, it is the depressing convergence of all these matters in one
miniscule man who is very likely to end up sitting in the chair of Chester
Arthur and Rutherford B. Hayes.

The Electoral College meets December 19th to vote.  So far, there's no
national movement for the Electoral College to reject Quayle, but it's
never too late to start one.  Yank this message and forward it to someone
you love in a state that voted for Bush/Quayle and then everyone bombard
everyone else with pleas that the state's electors reject Dim Dan Quayle.

Ban the boob!

Subj:   Misc stuff

Extracted from a local bulletin board

Dr. Bruce Ames, chairman of the Dept. of Biochemistry at Berkley, perhaps
THE recognized authority on what is cancerous has a new and profound
message.  But first a little history.  It was Ames who came up with the
current testing techniques that has been so applauded by all the scientists
and environmentalists.  It is his test that is used to determine what is
"carcinogenic".  Since his test came out, it has been used to ban many
things and condemn many others as cancerous. This guy has more credits than
most movies.

While Ames was teaching he decided to have his class use his test on
various household items.  He was surprised by his results.  Hair dyes and
kid's pajamas (the flame retardant) are carcinogenic.  Peanut Butter is a
hundred times more dangerous than the average daily intake of DDT.  Beer is
a thousand times more hazardous than anything in your drinking water [so
much for college students:-&gt;]  Fruit juice is naturally carcinogenic, as
are brown mustard, celery and parsely. As a matter of fact about half of
everything turns out to be "potentianlly carcinogenic" when given in
enormous doses.  So what does all this mean?

Ames is now trying to slaughter the Sacred Cows he unintentionally helped
create.  He now holds that the levels of most man made carcinogens are
generally so low that the natural carcinogens make them trivial.  Actually
this is great news.  It seems that we may not be tearing ourselves quite as
bad as we've feared.

                 Noah .

An amusing aside:  The major carcinogen in beer is formaldehyde. 12 oz. of
human blood as a result of normal metabolism,  contains 4.3 times the
amount of formaldehyde as an equal quantity of beer.  So what you ask?
Well the word's out, so you'd better be prepared to be tattooed with a
"Warning Label"

                       WRITE A UNIX VIRUS PROGRAM WHEN
                    YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER AND MAKE MAGIC

This message has been sent to you for good luck.  It has been around the world
nine times.  The luck has now been sent to you.  You will receive good luck
within four days after receiving this letter provided you in return write a
Unix virus program that sends it back out.  This is no joke.  You will receive
it in the mail.

Write a program that uses common Unix utilities to propagate itself across the
network.  Write it so that it modifies the Unix file system code to
spontaneously create copies of this letter in the mailer queue directory,
addressed to random users who you think want good luck.  Don't send money, as
fate has no price.  Do not delete this message.  You will need to include it
in your program, which must be running in 96 hours.  An employee at the
Network Control Center received $70,000.  Joe Elliot, of Sun Microcomputers in
Mountain View, received $40,000 and lost it because he broke the chain.  While
in the Philippines, Gen. Welsh lost his wife six days after receiving the
letter.  His virus program didn't work on the Air Force's Univac machines.
However, before her death she has won $30,000 in a lottery.  The money was
transferred to him four days after the Air Force awarded AT&amp;T a billion-dollar
contract to supply them with Unix machines.

Please write your virus program right now and see what happens in four days.
This message comes from MIT and was written by a turist in New Jersey, or
someplace like that.  Since the copy must make a tour of the world, you must
write 20 virus programs and start them on all the machines you have accounts
on, sending messages to your friends, associates, and everyone else in
/etc/passwd.  After a few days you will get a streak of luck.  This is true
even if you are not superstitious.

Do note the following: Constantine Dias, a systems manager at Raytheon,
received the chain in 1983. He asked his programmers to write 20 virus
programs and start them up.  A few days later he won the lottery of two
million dollars.  Aria Dadil, a tape ape at Symbolics, Inc., received the
letter and didn't write a virus program, saying something about random Unix
lossage.  His company reported record losses two days later and fired him.
Later after finding the message again, he wrote 20 virus programs and started
them up on a VAX at UDel.  A few days later he got a job as the director of
systems programming at Berkeley.  Dales Fairchild received the message and not
believing, deleted it.  Nine days later his company was bought by Heathkit,
Schlumberger, Western Digital, Fujitsu, Hughes, GM, and Beatrice, in
succession.

On August 20, 1985 the message was received with UUCP and mailed again for fun
and mere love in the world.  This message was forwarded by SENDMAIL with SMTP
on Sept.  1, 1986 and again on November 13, 1986, and once more on December
14, 1986.

Remember, send no money.  Please do not ignore this.  It works.

                      The FBI wants to hear from you!

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is attempting to gather critical
information necessary to pursue this case under the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act of 1986.  (This is the statute that makes it a federal crime
to penetrate a computer owned by or run on the behalf of the Government.)

The FBI Case Agent has asked the Defense Data Network Project Management
Office to collect the names of organizations and Points of Contact (names
and phone numbers) that were hit by the Virus.  The Defense Communications
Agency has established an E-Mail address for this collection at:

                       INFO-VACC [at] BEAST.DDN.MIL

    Points of Contact should expect to be contacted by their local FBI
    agents for dispositions due to the wide geographical area involved.

            The FBI needs this information to pursue the case.

      If we expect their aid in the future, we need to help them now.

While we're on the subject, a few useful bits from the AN/GRR-5 manual
ca. 1967 which might prove useful...

Chapter 9.  Section II.  Demolition.

9-4.  Methods of Destruction
  a. Smash.  Smash the controls, tubes, switches, capacitors, and transformers;
     use sledges, axes, handaxes, pickaxes, hammers, crowbars, or heavy tools.
  b. Cut.  Cut internal and external wires and cables; use axes, handaxes,
     or machetes.
Warning:  Be extremely careful with explosives and incendiary devices.  Use
 these items only when the need is urgent.
  c. Burn.  Burn cords, resistors, capacitors, wiring, and technical manual;
     use gasoline, kerosene, oil, flamethrowers, or incendiary grenades.
  d. Bend.  Bend panels and chassis.
  e.  Explosives.  If explosives are necessary, use firearms, grenades, or TNT.
  f.  Disposal.  Bury or scatter the destroyed parts in slit trenches,
      foxholes, or other holes, or throw them into streams.
  g.  Destroy.  Destroy everything.

Your headline generator reminded me of a headline I saw on the front of a
tabloid newspaper over here in the UK last week. It read...

        'Husband turned wife into coffee table'

I just couldn't resist buying this paper because in my wildest dreams I
couldn't quite come to terms with this headline. It turned out husband had
murdered his wife and to dispose of the body he had fed it through a
machine that pulps wood for use in making chipboard or fibreboard, you
know, the sort of thing your coffee table is made of!
