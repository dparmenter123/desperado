        The best convention coverage is on Comedy Central.  I hope they
        were as hard on the Democrats.  I'm splitting my time between
        Comedy Central and C-SPAN with only occasional resort to the
        networks, mostly for contrast.

        One of 'em had an interview with the Republican Balloon
        Coordinator, but I didn't catch his name.  Too bad. My son Dan
        dreamed up the brilliant idea that there should be as many helium
        balloons on the floor as there are heavier-than-air balloons in
        the ceiling.  Let 'em all go at once and watch them swap places.
        Much better ballooning.  If I'd caught his name, I would have
        passed this along to him.  The Republicans really understand
        balloons better than the Democrats.

        Another most important role, the clapping conductor.  There's a
        guy down front showing the Republicans where the beat is.  All
        important, particularly on the tricky CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP of "Deep
        in the Heart of Texas" that even tripped *me* up a couple of ishes
        ago.  Of course, I was typing, not clapping.

        One from Comedy Central Anchorman Al Franken:  "Buchanan
        thinks an environmental extremist is anyone in favor of shade."

        Calvin Trillin is the floor reporter for Comedy Central with Penn
        Jillette in the interview booth and Al Franken back in NYC.

        Another CC quote:  "Let's go to the feed.  It *is* the keynote
        speech after all."  If they hadn't identified it as the keynote,
        I'd never have guessed.  Republican = someone who thinks Phil
        Gramm has the stuff to make it to the presidency.  A dead
        wildebeest has a better chance of escaping the hyena jamboree than
        this stickman has at the Oval Office (where the word bimbo may
        never be uttered).

                                    =*=

        The chairman of the GOP convention said, "We are The People.  The
        Democrats are not The People."  Oooh!  Zinger!

        I did enjoy the brief glimpse of Republican Rapper TR-Q:  "Don't

        Those Democrats and their attack on family values:  The mocking of
        cousinship, the denigration of unclehood, the constant carping
        attacks on Mom, promotion of gay marriage, and the latest outrage,
        promotion of gay divorce.

        On the other hand, "there's something out there", as they say on
        the shores of Loch Ness.  Ms. magazine had a big anniversary of
        some kind and featured articles on every kind of woman you can
        imagine except one.  No Moms.

        This has been the most entertaining Presidential race in years.
        Even if I didn't think that Bush and the GOP were riding for a
        well-deserved fall this one is right up there with the delightful
        Weld/Silber campaign in Massachusetts for ranking and ragging and
        raging and fragging.

        I wish the papers would publish the anti-Clinton fax that that
        Bush sends out every day and not just tantalize us with quotes. We
        want full knowledge of the thoughts of the Bush campaign.  We want
        the whole thing!   This fax is where the phrase "bimbo eruption"
        came from.

        Only Bay Staters will really dig this, but political curmudgeon
        Howie Carr (of the dread Herald) has been calling Gov. Weld "Pink
        Floyd".

        For out-o-staters, the gov is an "orange-haired WASP", pro-gay,
        pro-choice, Republican, rock&amp;roll fan, and Bush supporter.  A
        couple of weeks ago he said Quayle had "the finest political mind
        in the White House", which may be true.

        MILLBOURNE, Pa. (UPI) -- Fears that outlaws will hide behind corn
stalks has prompted the borough of Millbourne to outlaw tall vegetables.
        An ordinance passed by the Borough Council this week makes it illegal
in the suburban Philadelphia community to grow corn or any other
vegetable that exceeds six feet in height.
        ``If you have eight-foot corn stalks it's easy for people to hide
behind them,'' said Millbourne police Sgt. Joseph Heffernan.
        In addition to banning tall vegetables, the ordinance also prohibits
the borough's 850 residents from growing vegetables of any kind in their
front yards.
        The yard ban followed complaints from residents who were offended by
the sight of vegetables growing in front of rowhouses.
        ``I think it looks like the very devil,'' said Council President
Dorothy McNeil, who said several of her neighbors were cultivating front
yard vegetable gardens.

Nostalgia - I remember some of the early days of Desperado.  I was a member
of RSX engineering in the Summer of 1980.  Sometime shortly after you
renamed your list to "DESPERADO.DAT" someone in the RSX group mentioned
to me that you sent out some funky, random, and interesting stuff to list
you called DESPERADO.  So, I asked to join.  I haven't said a lot over
the years, but I'm still here reading away...

Subj:   In re: Camels, last edition...

A very good friend of mine works at the Houston Zoo, and tells this story.
A certain zoo employee's job consisted of dealing with the camels
(feeding, etc.).   One day, one of the camels decided to play rough--it
pushed her down and _SAT_ on her!  Now she is no longer allowed in the
camel area...seems that once the camel has proven dominance over her by
sitting on her, it will sit on her _every_ _time_ now, because it can!

(Don't even want to consider the ad campaign that incorporates that trait...!)

Friend says only people come in second in aggressiveness and smelliness
to camels...!

Absolutely not, according to something I read in the last year or two:
the comedy circuit is now so big that hundreds of comics make big
bucks ($50K+/year) with yuks.

Subj:   What to use when fire-eating

My friend Ann Norton trained as a fire-eater in Fort Collins, Colorado,
and used to practice in the driveway when at home on vacations in Syracuse,
New York.  Her fuel of choice for breathing fire was kerosene.  It makes
a large yellow flame, if I remember correctly.  Her instructor was known
for a trick in which he set his chest hair on fire, which I guess you have
to save for finales of performances that are several months apart.  I only
let her burn the hair off one of my forearms with the torch after she promised
me it didn't hurt.  It didn't.  These are things that you don't tell your
mother what you're doing on vacation.  "We drive around in Peter's brother's
Fiat at 100 mph without the seatbelts, then we go over to Nort's house and
watch her breathe fire and burn hair off our body parts."

"Murder Can Be Fun" #14

    It's been way over a year since John "Disfigure and" Marr brought out
    the last installment of this San Francisco Threat, and I gotta say, it
    can't be for want of material.  Marr doesn't even try to excuse his
    tardiness this time round, who knows, maybe someone slipped him time
    release ecstacy or something.  But let's hope he's back to sit a spell,
    'cause no one can ramble those True Life Adventures like 'im.

    Sure, there are plenty of crime writers around, but no one swings it
    like Johnny.  In particular, his theme surveys (deaths during high
    school athletic events, deaths at Disneyland) establish one firmly in a
    world where death is sudden, unpredictable, and therefore amusing.
    Here's a representative sample from the excellent treatment of U.S.
    Postal Service massacres in issue 14 (printed without permission,
    what's he gonna do, kill me?):

        "Lupoli was joined in the USPS Lonely Hearts Rod &amp; Gun Club less
        than six months later by New Orleans postal worker Warren Murphy.
        Like Lupoli, the object of Murphy's spurned affections, Carol
        Smith, worked alongside him in the local post office. Unlike Bruni,
        Smith reciprocated. She'd lived with Murphy and there was even talk
        of marriage.  It wasn't to be, however.  Two months before the
        shooting started, she broke up with Murphy and moved out.

        "As postal workers are wont to do, Murphy took it poorly.  He
        became convinced that certain co-workers were making passes at
        Smith. In his jealousy, he tried to work the same shifts to keep
        his eye on her.  To pass the time on the job, he regaled her with
        stories about how he'd come into the post office and shoot her
        would-be lovers as she watched.

        "Things came to a head on December 14, 1988. On his day off, Murphy
        marched into the mailroom.  A supervisor, undoubtedly shocked by
        this un-postal behavior, intercepted him as he walked towards
        Smith. Murphy pulled a shotgun out of his pants leg and fired a
        single blast that cost the supervisor an eye and injured two other
        workers.  As the staff fled, he took Smith hostage and holed up in
        a storeroom for the siege.

        "Outside of two FBI agents slightly wounded by some stray birdshot,
        the 13-hour stand-off was fairly uneventful.  Murphy finally
        surrendered when cops pointed out that he was hardly setting a good
        example for his sons from a previous marriage. Smith was released
        unharmed and Murphy announced that he was 'happy to get the
        attention of management'."

    To discover Murphy's eventual fate, plus a tribute to American riots,
    plus another train disaster story, plus loads of fine book reviews,
    send a mere $1.50 to John Marr, P.O. Box 640111, San Francisco, CA
    94109.

"Chemical Imbalance" Vol. 2 # 3

    Besides the usual fine reviews and artwork, we got interviews with
    John-Boy Cage and Raymond Pettibone and Dennis Cooper, essays on Roger
    Gilbert-Lecomte and Kevin Ayers and Codeine, and poetry by Alfred Jarry
    and Hans Arp.

    Not as good as the best issue, not as bad as the worst.  But, as
    always, indispensible unless you give it away.  I can only think of two
    current critmags which randomize genre as well -- "Sulfur" and
    "Critical Inquiry" -- and neither manage to ignore pop / high culture
    boundries the way that we, real life, and "Chemical Imbalance" do in
    search of (as the title of local bisexzine goes) "Anything That
    Moves".

    Best news of the decade: "Chemical Imbalance magazine is herewith
    published quarterly."  Yeah, I know, McGonigal probably won't follow
    through, but that's the decade for you.  Nice 7 inch, too.  Become part
    of Dan Quaye's pride: buy at your nearest finer newstand or believe
    McGonigal and pay $21 for a year's sub at Box 1656 Cooper Station, New

"J. R. Williams' Bummer"

    Not as laugh-till-you-expel-gases funny as JRW's first Cat-Head
    publication, "Bad Comics", but more lovable somehow.  Tears of a clown
    and all that.  Even the JRW comic I used to hate most (a crybaby attack
    on a lover he didn't like, named Sue "'cause that's probably what
    she'll do if she ever reads this!") kind of fits right into the
    ill-tempered goofy whole.

    One half is kind of autobiographical.  The "Vampire Cowboys" are an
    extension (like "Saturday Night Live" trying to bump a Top-40 character
    along till the creator can get an HBO special) of his earlier amazing
    cowboy strip, but they're still pretty amazing as vampires. There's
    some more of his "good artist" Skinboy mime, and tributes to Mr. Ed

                     L'ISLE DE GILLIGAN

                        Brian Morton

     The hegemonic discourse of postmodernity valorizes modes of
expressive and "aesthetic" praxis which preclude any dialogic
articulation (in, of course, the Bakhtinian sense) of the
antinomies of consumer capitalism.  But some emergent forms of
discourse inscribed in popular fictions contain, as a
constitutive element, metanarratives wherein the characteristic
tropes of consumer capitalism are subverted even as they are
apparently affirmed.  A paradigmatic text in this regard is the
television series _Gilligan's Island_, whose seventy-two episodes
constitute a master-narrative of imprisonment, escape, and
reimprisonment which eerily encodes a Lacanian construct of
compulsive reenactment within a Foucaultian scenario of a
panoptic social order in which resistance to power is merely one
of the forms assumed by power itself. [1]

     The "island" of the title is a pastoral dystopia, but a
dystopia with a difference--or, rather, a dystopia with a
_differance_ (in, of course, the Derridean sense), for this is a
dystopia characterized by the free play of signifier
and signified.  The key figure of "Gilligan" enacts a dialect of
absence and presence.  In his relations with the Skipper, the
Millionaire, and the Professor, Gilligan is the repressed, the
excluded.  The Other:  He is the id to the Skipper's Ego, the
proletariat to the Millionaire's bourgeoisie, Caliban to the
Professor's Prospero. [2]  But the binarism of this duality is
deconstructed by Gilligan's relations with Ginger the movie star.
Here Gilligan himself is the oppressor:  Under the male gaze of
Gilligan, Ginger becomes the Feminine-as-Other, the
interiorization of a "self" that is wholly constituted by the
linguistic conventions of phallocratic desire (keeping in mind,
of course, Saussure's _langue/parole_ distinction).  That Ginger is
identified as a "movie star" even in the technologically barren
confines of the desert island foreshadows Debord's concept of the
"society of the spectacle," wherein events and "individuals" are
reduced to simulacra. [3]  Indeed, we find a stunningly prescient
example of what Baudrillard as called the "depthlessness" of
American in the apparent "stupidity" of Gilligan and, indeed, of
the entire series. [4]

     The eclipse of linearity effectuated by postmodernity, then,
necessitates a new approach to the creation of modes of
liberatory/expressive praxis.  The monologic and repressive
dominance of traditional "texts" (i.e., books) has been
decentered by a dialogic discourse in which the "texts" of
popular  culture have assumed their rightful place.  This has
enormous implications for cultural and social theory.  A journal
like _Dissent_, instead of exploring the question of whether
socialism is really dead, would make a greater contribution
to postmodern discourse by exploring the question of whether
Elvis is really dead.  This I hope to demonstrate in a future
study.

FOOTNOTES

1. Gilligan himself represents the transgressive potentialities
of the decentered ego.  See Georges Thibault, _Jouissance et
Jalousie dans L'Isle de Gilligan_, unpublished dissertation on
file at the Ecole Normale Superieure (St. Cloud).

2. _Gilligan's Island_ may be periodized into an early, Barthean
phase, in which most episodes ended with an exhibition of
Gilliganian _jouissance_, and a second phase whose main
inspiration is apparently that of Nietzsche, via Lyotard.  The
absence of any influence of Habermas is itself a testimony to the
all-pervasiveness of Habermas's thought.

3. The 1981 television movie _Escape from Gilligan's Island_
represents a reactionary attempt to totalize what had been
theorized in the series as an untotalizable herteroglossia, a
_bricolage_.  The late 1970s influence of the Kristevan semiotic
needs no further comment here.

4. Why do the early episodes privilege a discourse of metonymy?
And what of the title--_Gilligan's Island_?  In what sense is the
island "his"?  I do not have the space to pursue these questions
here, but I hope to do so in a forthcoming book.

Subj:   Taylor Clay

Several years ago I took a class in homebuilding at the Austin (Texas)
Community College.  The final exam (a take-home) asked for a definition of
"Taylor Clay".  Here is the reply I gave:

Taylor "Black Dirt" Clay was an early pioneer in the Austin area.
He was well known for his temperamental personality -- normally a
hard, crusty man, shrinking back from and offering very little support
to those around him.  However, he would undergo a considerable
transformation when "well lubricated", become very expansive, lifting
and bouying the spirits of all that came in contact with him.  He
settled East of what is now downtown Austin, his lands extending North
roughly from the Colorado river, and East from a line running from Mueller
airport to Pflugerville.

Mr. Clay and his wife had three sons:  Navarro Group Clay, Midway Group
Clay, and "Eagle" Ford Clay ("Group" was an old family name on his wife's
side).  Mr Clay also had an illegitimate son, Del Rio, by a Mexican
mistress.  This son proved to be the most worthy of the four, so in his
last years the elder Clay adopted him, passing on the family name to him
as well.   The Clays also had five daughters.  Being true pioneers of the
soil, they named their daughters after geological features:  Alluvium,
Tributary, High Terrace, and finally Upper Colorado River Terrace and
Lower Colorado River Terrace.  All of Mr. Clay's sons inherited his
curious personality, and to a lesser extent his daughters did as well,
although in general they were said to be more stable, albeit somewhat
gritty and abrasive.

All of Mr. Clay's children settled in the Austin area.  The elder Clay's
plantation became knows as "Taylor Clay land", and finally just "Taylor
Clay".  Similarly, the land farmed by his sons became known by their
names.  Area residents soon noticed the similarity between the soil and
the men who farmed it, and the soil itself was referred to as "Taylor
Clay", "Midway Group Clay", "Eagle Ford Clay", and "Del Rio Clay".
Eventually, the word "clay" came to be used to describe any sticky,
extremely fine-grained soil that expands and contracts dramatically with
changes in moisture content.

Today, these early settlers have been forgotten, but their names live on
in the soil they farmed.  These soils present a challenge to the
homebuilder, who must allow for the unstable support that they offer for
a foundation.  Slab foundations must be considerably stronger to survive
on clay than they would have to be on more stable soil.  This generally
requires either significant overbuilding of the slab, or an engineered
slab.

"Pflugerville" really is the name of a town north of Austin, made famous
in song by the Lounge Lizards.

&gt; i make a habit of taking in my pennies every time i get a big apple juice
&gt;jar full of them, just the other day i took some in actually...
&gt;
&gt;wait a few months inbetween and it adds up to about $15-20,
&gt;this makes for painless investment capital, which i always immediately

&gt;i realise its not a large amount of money but if you do it consistently
&gt;you can accumuate about $100 a year practically out of thin air...
&gt;well, it beats just throwing them away anyway....
&gt;
&gt; i wonder what the old pennypincher himself, ben franklin would do in
&gt;today's market?
&gt;
OK, two stories about investing in pennies.

Story 1:  Several years ago, I was really upset about my tax bill, and
eager for any kind of revenge, even symbolic.  I noticed that when
people drop pennies in the street, they don't bother to pick them up, because
when I looked down as I walked, I could pick up about 10 or 15 a day.
So I began to watch for pennies, and picked up everyone I saw, and kept
track of how many I picked up.  After a year, tax time rolled around, and
I had picked up about $35 in pennies, WHICH I DID NOT REPORT ON MY TAX
FORM.  So, HA HA HA HA HA HA IRS, NOW YOU KNOW, I RIPPED YOU OFF FOR
$16 IN TAXES, AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU COME AFTER ME FOR IT, BECAUSE I
WILL FIGHT YOU TO THE SUPREME COURT FOR AN OFFSETTING DEDUCTION FOR THE
HOLES IN MY POCKETS!!!!!!!

Story 2:  Several years ago, a not-too-bright friend of mine decided to
invest in pennies for their COPPER CONTENT.  The thinking was that
copper was going up, a pound of pennies was then worth about 92 cents, and
the government was going to a penny that was 90% zinc for this reason.
So he bought $5000 dollars (over a period of time) of copper pennies,
and was storing them in the bedroom of his second story apartment.  How
much do 500,000 pennies weigh?  I don't know exactly (about the same
as a non-stretch limo?) but it was enough so that one day, when he came in
and dropped his latest bags of pennies on the floor, the floor collapsed
and the pennies CRASHED INTO THE APARTMENT BELOW!  Fortunately, no one
was killed, but he had to pay for the damage, which was substantial.

I think he's into commodity trading now.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        He was into commodity trading then too.

        A copper penny (US one-cent piece) weighs about 3 grams.  I get
        3350-some pounds.

        Since coins are not legal tender, if you try to pay your taxes in
        pennies, your pennies will be returned to you at your expense.

&gt; Subject: Shells vs. GUI's vs. Muhammed Ali
&gt; Summary: BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED teaches EVERYBODY a lesson
&gt; Keywords: alien blintzes
&gt; Organization: University of Massachusetts, Amherst
&gt;
&gt; In response to the holy gospel of:
&gt; &gt;[Shells are great, GUI's are greater, Finder vs. Workbench, etc...]
&gt;
&gt;       I am getting TIRED of all you people comparing user interfaces,
&gt; shells and GUI's, etc, when you all have absolutely NO IDEA what you are
&gt; talking about!!  I think you all need a lesson in user interface history.
&gt; The following text should make it all PERFECTLY CLEAR and stop these
&gt; POINTLESS "shell vs. GUI" arguments for good.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A BRIEF HISTORY OF USER INTERFACES
&gt;
&gt;       Thousands of years ago, back in Paleolithic times, user interfaces
&gt; were very primitive.  They essentially consisted of a thick, wooden club
&gt; that was used to "access" your enemy's brains.  Simple but effective, this
&gt; interface has since been adopted by the famed BLAZEMONGER "Customer
&gt; Service" Department.
&gt;
&gt;       At first, there was little or no standardization; users had to
&gt; learn entirely new methods of "access" for human enemies, mammoths,
&gt; mastodons, Saber-C tigers, etc.  But as time went on, people settled on two
&gt; basic modes of use:
&gt;
&gt;       (A)     Run as fast as you can in a straight line, bashing everything
&gt;               in sight.
&gt;
&gt;       (B)     Stand in one place, swinging the club wildly in all
&gt;               directions.
&gt;
&gt; These 2 modes became so popular that they were given names that have
&gt; survived to this day:  "sequential access" and "random access."
&gt;
&gt;       This went on for centuries, with users happily "accessing" each
&gt; others' bodily parts with bigger and bigger clubs, until the 20th century,
&gt; when the COMPUTER was invented.  Tired of crushing each other's skulls,
&gt; users flocked to the new invention, eager to put their talents to new uses,
&gt; like playing video games and building "Star Wars" missile systems.
&gt;
&gt;       The first computer user interface consisted of a large button on
&gt; the front panel, labeled "0".  By pressing this button repeatedly, users
&gt; could "program" the computer to do all kinds of tasks.  Sadly, none of
&gt; these programs worked, and the scientists could not figure out why.
&gt; Then, in 1962, some dweeb finally had the idea to add a "1" button,
&gt; and the Computer Age officially began.
&gt;
&gt;       But pressing "0" and "1" buttons was not anybody's favorite
&gt; pastime, so some other dweeb invented the computer terminal.  Thanks to
&gt; this clever device, with over 50 different keys, users were able to
&gt; create bugs and cause crashes dozens of times faster than before.
&gt; But at least the hardware was now in place, so it was time to address the
&gt; software issues of user interfaces.
&gt;
&gt;       First, there was the command-line interface.  This allowed users
&gt; to type a line of text representing a "command", press the RETURN key, and
&gt; receive a response like "0x38754: ERROR_NOTEXT_PETUNIA".  Thanks to this
&gt; handy software tool, the suicide rate rose almost overnight.
&gt;
&gt;       But in the mid 1970's, the clever folks at AT&amp;T invented the UNIX
&gt; "shell".  This was a SIGNIFICANT advance over ordinary command-line
&gt; interfaces, as the following example shows:
&gt;
&gt;       ORDINARY COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE:
&gt;
&gt;               type myfile
&gt;               0x9852: ERROR_FILE_LACTOSE_ANAL
&gt;
&gt;       UNIX SHELL:
&gt;
&gt;               $ cat myfile
&gt;               Segmentation fault - core dumped
&gt;
&gt;       For many years, command-line interfaces dominated the computer market.
&gt; Smart computer buyers began to compare the power of different operating
&gt; systems by how much they let you tailor the command-line prompt.  For
&gt; example, my friend John would only use computers that let him set the
&gt; prompt to:
&gt;
&gt;               Suction?
&gt;
&gt; Nobody knew why.  Eventually, John was given a job in the Federal Government.
&gt;
&gt;       But these years of happy command-lining were fated to end.  Behind
&gt; the scenes, those clever folks at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto useR interfaCes)
&gt; were creating a completely graphic user interface.  We modern computer users
&gt; are familiar with windows, icons, and clicking, but the first attempts at
&gt; Xerox PARC were quite different from this.  For example, the early version
&gt; of the "mouse" was shaped more like a semi-automatic machine gun.  To select
&gt; an icon, users would point it at the screen, click the button, and blast the
&gt; icon to pieces.  This was great fun, and kept the Xerox programmers amused
&gt; for months.  Eventually, the Xerox hardware engineers developed a device
&gt; more like the modern mouse, and the programmers used that instead -- point,
&gt; click, and the icon blows up.  Alternatively, you could drag the icon around
&gt; the screen, smearing blood and guts all over the place.
&gt;
&gt;       After a few years of fun and games, some dweeb at Xerox PARC finally
&gt; had the idea that the icons could be used to represent FILES.  WOW!!!  The
&gt; world had many responses to the Xerox breakthrough.  Computer users
&gt; congratulated Xerox for this brilliant manuever.  The President of the
&gt; United Nations pinned a medal right on the Xerox building!  And Apple
&gt; Computer stole the idea outright and created the Macintosh.
&gt;
&gt;       The "Mac" truly brought computing power to the common people.  Even
&gt; the most naive, ignorant Mac user was able, with a simple mouseclick, to
&gt; cause a spectacular crash.  This same philosophy has stayed with the machine
&gt; through the years.  The most recent operating system version is called
&gt; "System 7", which to me sounds like a bad science-fiction TV show, and it
&gt; has many new and exciting features.  One of the most novel features is the
&gt; "Help Balloon" mode, which allows the user to see what anything on the
&gt; screen is thinking to itself.  Unfortunately, most computer icons and menu
&gt; items are very boring thinkers, so the balloons usually say things like "I
&gt; wonder when the user will click on me" or "Will you PLEASE move me away from
&gt; the 'HyperMoose' icon -- it smells really bad!"
&gt;
&gt;       In 1985, two new machines with GUI's appeared on the market:
&gt; the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga.  The ST's graphic user interface
&gt; is called "GEM", which stands for "Graphic User Interface".  Although
&gt; initially popular, the ST has died a slow death, partly due to operating
&gt; system bugs, such as the infamous "40 folder limit".  If the user tried
&gt; to create more than 40 subdirectories inside a directory, Jack Tramiel
&gt; would come to his house and whack him on the head with a thick, wooden
&gt; club.  This caused permanent braindamage in many ST users, and they can
&gt; still be found to this day saying things on the Net like "Tramiel is God"
&gt; and "Amigas can't multitask".
&gt;
&gt;       The Commodore Amiga was introduced with version 1.0 of its
&gt; system software.  This combined a great CLI, a great GUI, and the
&gt; awesome ability to crash 12 times per hour.  Following this success,
&gt; versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 were released rapidly over a short period of
&gt; only 25 years.
&gt;
&gt;       But the real Amiga breakthrough came with the introduction of
&gt; Amiga OS 2.04.  Originally, this was available only on Amiga 3000's
&gt; sold in Albania to certified developers who knew the secret password and
&gt; Marc Barrett's social security number; but after a mere 400 years, it was
&gt; made available to the public.
&gt;
&gt;       OS 2.04 was the first version to make the GUI "Workbench" truly
&gt; usable.  In previous versions, dragging an icon with the mouse required the
&gt; user to hold down seven or eight different keys simultaneously while dancing
&gt; the "Funky Chicken".  In addition, not all files had icons, meaning that the
&gt; Workbench could not access them.  But thanks to version 2.04, every file
&gt; now has over FOUR HUNDRED different icons, for a totally streamlined
&gt; and efficient interface.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; SHELLS VS. GUI'S
&gt;
&gt;       With both shells and GUI's now in existence, each has its fans and
&gt; enemies.  Proponents of GUI's say they can do ANYTHING as well as shells can.
&gt; In fact, street corners in major cities are often occupied by these people,
&gt; stopping random folks as they pass by, and saying things like "I can do that
&gt; in FEWER than THREE mouse-clicks!!"  Currently, there is legislation pending
&gt; that will make such comments punishable by heavy fines and/or death.
&gt;
&gt;       On the other hand, proponents of shells say that GUI's are a waste
&gt; of time.  They commonly cite examples like the "delete wildcard" problem.
&gt; &gt;From birth, all shell users are able to type ridiculously complicated
&gt; "delete" commands like the following:
&gt;
&gt;               1&gt;  delete #?.(a|A?)*&amp;-2^5%%*.*vavoom!
&gt;
&gt; which says, of course, to delete all files named #?.(a|A?)*&amp;-2^5%%*.*vavoom!
&gt; "Let's see you do THAT with a GUI!" they cry.  The GUI users are silent
&gt; about this, mainly because they are all out doing useful work instead,
&gt; like blowing up icons with a mouse.
&gt;
&gt;       In any event, most people today admit that the ease-of-use of a shell
&gt; FAR exceeds the "thick wooden club" interface of Paleolithic times.  But
&gt; designers haven't stopped working on the problem of friendlier and more
&gt; useful interfaces.  So we now have...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; MORE MODERN USER INTERFACES
&gt;
&gt;       Extended keyboards.  Touch screens.  5-button joysticks.  Virtual
&gt; reality.  MIDI synthesizers.  Light pens.  Cardboard boxes.  Hand grenades.
&gt; Canned tuna.  Vaginal warts.  All of these concepts have affected the way
&gt; people use computers.  Thanks to modern research, many new and "hybrid"
&gt; interfaces have been developed.  The following is a brief description
&gt; of some of the more interesting ones.
&gt;
&gt; (1)   Point 'n hit-return
&gt;
&gt;               Clicking on the icon inserts text into the command line,
&gt;               which can then be edited.  Press RETURN when done.
&gt;
&gt; (2)   Type 'n click
&gt;
&gt;               The user types a command.  Every key pressed on the keyboard
&gt;               causes an icon to be displayed on the screen.  When finished
&gt;               typing, drag select or double-click the entire set of icons.
&gt;               Or just drag them into the trashcan... whichever is more
&gt;               efficient.
&gt;
&gt; (3)   Point 'n spit
&gt;
&gt;               Instead of a mouse, the user chews a large wad of tobacco
&gt;               or a small, dead animal.  To activate an icon, merely
&gt;               spit at the screen.
&gt;
&gt; (4)   The pepperoni pizza interface
&gt;
&gt;               The screen contains an image of a large pizza.  The crust
&gt;               represents the operating system, the cheese is the windowing
&gt;               system, and the toppings are the individual files.  Using
&gt;               a digital pizza cutter, the user hacks off a piece of the
&gt;               pizza and deposits it into an onscreen "mouth" which
&gt;               then digests the information.  A resounding belch comes
&gt;               from the internal disk drive, and it is ready for the
&gt;               next command.
&gt;
&gt; (5)   The BLAZEMONGER interface
&gt;
&gt;               This is, of course, the ULTIMATE interface.  It consists of
&gt;               a hunk of raw meat that is hurled with high velocity at a
&gt;               "touch screen".  If it hits the right icon, the user is
&gt;               rewarded by NOT having his/her nipples torn off with
&gt;               tweezers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; CONCLUSIONS
&gt;
&gt;       That ends our little tour of user interface history.  This should
&gt; clear up all the .advocacy arguments from the past 3 or 4 months.

Subj:   Prarie Dogs and Pontiffs

Given the masthead of Desperado, I thought all the desperados (or is it
spelled desperadoEs?  Let's ask Mr. Quayle!) might find the following bit
of news of great interest.  (Well, of some passing interest anyway.)

&gt;From the Sunday New York Times (July 26th, I think).

        Prairie Dogs Holding Own in Face-Off With Pope

        Environmental concerns modify plans for a rally.

By DIRK JOHNSON
Special to The New York Times

DENVER, July 25 --- On a sloping hill framed by distant mountaintops, the
Cherry Creek Reservoir seemed to be an ideal setting for followers of Pope
John Paul II to celebrate Mass when he visits here next summer.

But people here worry that the Pope and his following of 300,000 or more would
displace the inhabitants of the state park surrounding the Denver reservoir.
No, not the homeless. The rodents.

Colonies of prairie dogs have burrowed a network of tunnels under Cherry Creek
park. Environmentalists say the rally would trample the prairie dogs' habitat.
So organizers of the Pope's visit have promised to go to extraordinary lengths
to safeguard the animals if the Cherry Creek park is used.

They would hire a contractor to vacuum the prairie dogs from their holes, then
keep them in storage until the two-day rally at the park is over.  Animal-
welfare experts endorse the procedure.

"I don't know what the big deal is," said Jim Bruce, the organizer of the
Pope's visit, who added that he has now heard it all.

The cost of moving the prairie dogs has been estimated at $100,000 to
$300,000.

Environmentalism is serious business in Denver. Voters here rejected the 1976
Winter Olympics, in part, because they feared ecological damage.

                                *   *   *

Prairie dogs once lived throughout much of the West, but human settlement has
destroyed at least 90 percent of their habitat. The city of Denver was built
on vast prairie dog colonies.

But prairie dogs can still be found throughout Colorado in sagebrush and
grassland. Many ranchers despise them, because their holes sometimes trip
cattle. The rural town of Nucla, for example, holds a yearly prairie dog shoot
with a prize for the hunter who kills the most.

Wildlife experts say the two-day rally planned for the park could pose a
danger not only to the prairie dogs but also to red-tail hawks, golden eagles
and many other animals.

"The prairie dog is representative of the ecosystem," said Todd Malmsbury, a
spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.

Environmentalists say the rally might also ruin the native grasses in the
park, which could take a long time to revive.

"There has never been an event anywhere near this size in the park," said
Antoinette DeLaura, a spokeswoman for the Colorado State Parks which is
responsible for the park.

A neighborhood group, the Coalition to End Negative Developments, has raised
concerns about lasting damage to the park, as well as traffic congestion and
noise in the area.  "I'm not sure we want him in our backyard," said Kate
Taucher, the leader of the group, told The Denver Post.

At the least, some environmentalists say the park would require reseeding
after the rally to restore the native grasses.

The Pope's appearance is the featured event of World Youth Day, a gathering of
young Roman Catholics from around the world.  The World Youth Day, which has
previously been held in Italy, Spain, Argentina and Poland, would include a
13-mile pilgrimage by young people from downtown Denver to the Cherry Creek
park.

"lt is a 1990's pilgrimage, with sneakers replacing sandals and modern
transportation replacing camel and horse," said Archbishop William H. Keeler
of Baltimore who is the chairman of the event.  "I expect many young people
will come by foot and bike. Whatever way they travel young people will
encounter God in the near-timeless mountains."

The event is expected to bring millions of dollars from tourism to the Denver
area, the sponsors say.

Among Catholics in Denver, the concerns raised by environmentalists have been
met warmly. "We think they're right to be concerned," said Charleen Scott, the
editor of the Denver Catholic Register newspaper.  "We don't throw stones at
environmentalists.  We're with them."

But some people say the concerns have been exaggerated. Joe Ryan, who lives
near the park, noted that about one million people use it each year.

"There is nothing pristine about this park," Mr. Ryan said. "This whole thing
has really gone too far."

         presumably a nut or some such, in its forepaws and eating.  Looks
         pretty much like a squirrel without the bushy tail, though perhaps
         stockier.]

        Your prairie dog is a marmot, as is your notorious woodchuck or
        your  groundhog, who turn gentle gardeners into raving loonies
        improvising flamethrowers and landmines out of common household
        materials.  The one in the picture was probably eating a
        cauliflower.

        Prairie dog holes don't just "trip" cattle; they break their legs;
        the cows have to be killed.

        The contractor with the power to suck prairie dogs out of their
        hole is indeed the source of that line in the masthead.  I
        received quite a few copies of another netpiece about him and had
        concluded that it was so widely circulated that I wouldn't need to
        run it.  Then came one more copy with the suggestion that
        "powerful enough to suck prairie dogs from their holes" might make
        a good addition to the masthead.  I couldn't have agreed more, so
        I added it, with the subtlety that I had never actually run the
        original item.  So now, with this followup here, we have closed
        the circle.

Subject: Elmer Fudd works for HP

I passed the instruction file for an HP kernel patch through the sed
script known as elmerfudd.  I edited it down (it DOES get a bit
redundant when overused) to this excerpt.  Only now does it occur to
me how outrageous Elmer would have been if he had ever gotten into the
computer world, from the first time he "pwessed Wetuwn"!

Enjoy!

Subj:   A TRUE STORY

        Today I gave the Physics Department Colloquium at LLNL.  For
my humor viewgraph at the beginning, I had a transparency with two
plots, with the bottom plot initially covered.  The top plot, labelled
"Amazing Progress," showed the improvement in a materials property vs.
time that we had made.  I explained that this was the version that you
show to management and funders.

        The bottom plot was the same data, plotted in a more honest
way, as a dimensionless figure of merit as a function of time.  It was
labelled, "Slow evolutionary progress," and I explained that this was
the version for electrical engineers, who don't believe in Amazing
Progress.

        About 10 minutes into the talk, the Head of the Physics
Department came in.   At the end of my talk, he asked about progress
towards applications of the research.    I pulled out the Amazing
Progress plot and explained it to him with the bottom half of the
transparency covered.   I don't think he understood why the audience
thought this was funny!

        Please don't include lines containing just a "." in column 1.  There
        are a bunch of broken Unix mailers out there that interpret that as
        end of message.
