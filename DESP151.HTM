Subj: Why We Fight

Recently, one of the Saints in 'programmer heaven' was guiding an
interested group of tourists through the premises.

They opened one door and found scores of programmers busily at work but there
were only 3 reference manuals!  When the tourists asked who they were, the
guide said "this is where we put IBM system programmers - we feel that since
they had to scour those massive IBM tomes while on earth, we'd give them a
break and condense all the necessary info into 3 books."

They opened a second door and found a busy bunch of programmers surrounded by
SCORES of reference books!  Again the tourists asked why, and the guide
responded "these are UNIX system programmers and we felt that since they only
had 3 or 4 books to refer to while on earth, we would give them reams of
information to refer to while here."

They then saw a third door that was ajar.  The tour guide had the group
tip-toe past this door VERY quietly so as not to disturb the occupants.  They
were not allowed to open the door and look inside as with the first two rooms.
When the tourists asked why, the guide said "This is where we keep the VMS
system programmers.  They think they are the only ones up here."

From: Eric Postpischil ......................................... Nashua, NH,

Betty Hurst asks what "Always mount a scratch monkey." means.  Here is one
version of the story:

[Ed: From the RSTS32::WAR_STORY Notes Conference, note 47.3.  MC]

This is the way I first heard the Scratch Monkey Story eight years ago.  The
guy who told it was Bud DeFore.  He used to be the intercept man for K.O. calls
(when an irate customer called, the switchboard would do a Trap to DeFore).
Seems one day Bud was sitting at his desk when the phone rang.

    Bud:        Hello.                  Voice:  YOU KILLED MABEL!!
    B:          Excuse me?              V:      YOU KILLED MABEL!!

This went on for a couple of minutes and Bud was getting nowhere, so he decided
to alter his approach to the customer.

    B:          HOW DID I KILL MABEL?   V:      YOU PM'ED MY MACHINE!!

Well to avoid making a long story even longer, I will abbreviate what had
happened.  The customer was a Biologist at a University in Florida and he had a
PDP12 that controlled gas mixtures that Mabel (the monkey) breathed.  Now Mabel
was not your ordinary monkey. The University had spent years teaching Mabel to
swim and they were studying the effects that different gas mixtures had on her
physiology. It turns out that the Field Service Branch had just gotten a new
Calibrated Power Supply (used to calibrate Analog equipment) and at their first
opportunity, decided to calibrate the D/A converters in the PDP12.  This
changed some of the gas mixtures and poor Mabel was asphyxiated.  Well Bud then
called the Branch Manager of the Field Service branch:

    Manager:    Hello
    B:          This is Bud DeFore, I heard you did a PM at the University
                of Blah-de-blah.
    M:          Yes, we really performed a complete PM.  What can I do for you?
    B:          Can you swim?

================================================================================

The moral is, of course, that you should always mount a scratch monkey.  (For
readers less involved with computers, you should always mount a scratch disk
before starting work that may corrupt a disk with valuable information on it.)

Subj:   A new way for Desperado to make money in the luncheon market

            BEAR MARKET MEANS BARGAIN FOR DINERS
                       By Paul Lewis

           (reprinted without permission from the
                New York Times News Service)

PARIS - The two hungry diners sat down, turned expectantly to a
flickering computer screen on a nearby stand and began studying the
latest quotations.  The news seemed ominous.  Making money would not be
easy in today's luncheon market.

The scene was La Connivence, a small new bistro-style restaurant at 6
Rue Feydeau, a stone's throw from the Paris Bourse, or stock exchange.
As with stocks on the exchange, the laws of supply and demand determine
the price diners at La Connivence pay for a meal.  (The name, La
Connivence, means complicity, with the slightly shady overtones
appropriate for a gambling den of sorts.)

As patrons place their orders in the austere ground-floor dining room,
one of the owners, Jean-Claude Trastour, enters them into a computer
which promptly adjusts the menu prices to reflect demand.  Popular
dishes, like popular stocks, go up in price while less popular ones
decline.

Timorous diners may choose to pay the quoted price for a dish at the
moment they order it.  That is called eating on the march comptant, or
cash market.  If the price rises while these diners are tucking in, they
have done very well for themselves.  If the price falls, they get
indigestion.  It is the safe way to eat - safe and dull.

More adventurous folks play the futures market, the march a terme,
agreeing to pay the price quoted when they call for the check at the end
of their meal.  Naturally, they hope the price will have fallen by that
fateful moment.  But hopes may be dashed by a flurry of buying, and the
price may easily shoot up.  Worse indigestion.

The newly seated diners began preparing their gambling strategy by
reading the trends.  They saw that the prices of several dishes had
already fallen by close to 6 francs--the limit for price changes up or
down in any one eating-trading session.  (A dollar is worth about 7
francs.)  That left little room for further decline.  There would be no
point in ordering any of those dishes, no matter how delectable--unless,
of course, the diner was more interested in eating than in successful
speculation.

The computer screen flashed chute du filet mignon, indicating that the
price of that choice steak had already fallen 5 francs, to 50 francs a
serving.  A veal casserole with herbs had slipped 4 francs, to 48 francs.
 A rack of lamb chops for two, down 10 francs, was priced to sell for
110 francs a serving.  As for the haddock, the computer reported a
"sharp fall" of 5 francs a portion, to 57 francs.

Other dishes were doing better.  The screen showed that a "stampede" of
orders for lotte had pushed the price of that pleasant Mediterranean
fish up 4 francs to 62 francs a portion, making it an interesting
speculation.  If diners played the forward market, the price might be
substantially lower when the time came to pay; of course, it could still
rise another 2 francs before reaching the 6 francs ceiling.

Occasionally, a diner's greed is outweighed by the thought of what he
would have to eat to turn a profit.  An example: "Victorious advance of
the stuffed pigs' trotter," the computer flashed, marking it up 5
francs, to 43 francs.  Surely it could only fall.  But a lunch of pigs'
feet?

In the end, the diners chose a conservative strategy, ordering the
special of the day, saddle of lamb, on the marche a terme.  The lamb
was trading at 39 francs a portion; up a modest 2 francs for the day
thus far.

The check arrived for the conservative diners: 228 francs for two, which
is pretty good by Paris standards since it included a bottle of
Beaujolais, a cheese-filled ravioli from the French Alps for a starter,
homemade apple tart, and coffee.  But the roast saddle of lamb stood at
38 francs, only a meager 1 franc cheaper than when it was ordered.  Down
the street, the Bourse was having one of its best days ever.

      Dog Swallows Musical Watch

   SHREWSBURY, England (AP) - For Fudge, a 15-month-old boxer dog,
the week has been, well ... alarming.
   He swallowed his master's musical watch Sunday, and for the next
couple of days his stomach played ``American Patrol'' every 12 hours.
   With Fudge giving vent to Glenn Miller's memorable melody at 6:45
every morning and evening, his owner, 13-year-old Marcus Waters,
took him to the vet.
   The vet, Sandy Frew, opened him up Wednesday and found that the
dog's digestive juices were disintegrating the watch. Rather than
pick out the fragments one by one, Frew sewed Fudge up again and
advised Marcus to wait for a natural ending to the problem.
   ``I've removed toys, stones and all sorts of other things from
dogs before, but this is the first time I've come across a dog that
swallowed a watch,'' said Frew.
   Marcus was given the watch to wake him for his daily rounds as a
newspaper delivery boy in this city in western England.
   Said his father John, 55: ``From now on we'll have to make sure
we keep everything well away from Fudge. He'll eat anything. But
he's a grand dog and we've no intention of getting rid of him.''

No, we don't do defence work.  Of course, we've never baulked at allowing
Norden to pay us a tidy sum for the privilege of militarising the VAX...
It is hypocritical to refuse to do military work whilst allowing others to
do it for one, in much the same way that it is hypocritical to decry the
killing of animals from a mouth filled with steak.  Whether we like it or
not, there is a need for military work, unless we'd all rather be learning
to say "Yes, Comrade" and "No, Comrade" and "Right away, Comrade".  There
is a saying:  "A real person is one who has the guts to shoot his own dog."
The bloody unfortunate fact of life is that there is a dog that needs to
be shot - do we as a company have the guts to shoot it?

So much for equal time.

Subj:   Digital and defense industry

I don't think it's quite accurate to say that Digital has shunned the
defense industry.  Digital has licensed somebody (Norden, I think --
they of the famous WWII bombsights) to make militarized PDPs and maybe
VAXen for years.  And Digital was also pantingly eager to bring VAX Ada
to market, in order to make sure that DoD contractors would keep buying
VAXen.  I know that Digital advertises regularly in Aviation Week and
Space Technology, about as militaristic a journal as you will find on
newsstand short of Soldier of Fortune.

Digital does not make weapons directly, but we make and actively market
tools for the weapons industry.  We've been doing it for years.  By
moving from a Honeywell (or Sylvania, where I used to edit and produce
military comm. systems proposals and Minuteman technical manuals), one
just moves slightly away from the tip of the military-procurement
pyramid.

  The last issue raised the issue of DEC allowing Raytheon to be a DEC
licensee.

  Why would anyone object to Raytheon, and not Norden, or Harris ?
For that matter, why is a hardware license different in this sense from
a software license ?

  DEC has done business with the military-industrial complex for many
years. There is nothing new in that.

  Why would anyone swallow an elephant and strain at a gnat ?

Subj:   More on Raytheon.

I wrote to Ken about Digital's deal with Raytheon, because I read the
announcement as being distinctly different from the deal with Norden.
I've met with Digital management to find out if it is different or not.
I haven't heard back from them, so I don't know the answer yet.

The issue is not disarmament or the need for defense, etc.  It is about how
far one goes to support one's country (in time of peace, that is, before
we escalate it to war, when things get very much different!)  I want to pay
my taxes, support my government, political candidates, etc, but I want to
draw a LINE somewhere in terms of what I will do to support the "military."
I won't cross the line, as long as we are "at peace."  I don't claim that
my line makes me "right" and others "wrong."  I think everybody has to
draw their own line, and we ought not to point to each other and say "that
is a foolish place to draw your line" or worse, that "lines cannot be
drawn."  I think these lines are hard to draw, but that we all draw them,
whether consciously or unconsciously.  (For example, I bet that knowing what
you know today, no more, no less, that you would all draw a line and refuse
to push a button that launched a first strike.)

I wanted to see if the Raytheon deal was on the unacceptable side of where
I draw my line, hence the letter to Ken.  I also think that many others
have drawn their own line and would be interested in knowing whether the
Raytheon deal alters things for them, hence I made the letter public, and
urged others to find out for themselves.

I'll relate what I find out.
