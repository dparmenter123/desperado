                                        From:      Bob McCauley @VRO
                                        Dept:      DIS/DT Data Networks

    On December 24th, the EASYnet passed a major milestone: the 25,000th
    node was registered.  This event caused me to reflect on what the
    network really means, and how large and complex it really is.

    Each of the 25,000 DECnet nodes is a cpu, and the number doesn't
    include dumb terminals or other Ethernet devices such as terminal
    servers and bridges.  The fact that each of these 25,000 systems has
    full functionality in DECnet's "peer-to-peer" environment is what
    makes our networking products superior to anyone else's in the
    industry.

    For a while now, we have been calling the EASYnet the "world's
    largest private network" and many of you remember when we reached
    10,000 nodes in May 1986.  This rate of growth (nearly doubling in
    size every 12 months) has been sustained since the initial creation
    of the EASYnet.  Our ability to respond to this continuous rapid
    growth and to maintain the overall quality of network service levels
    is what distinguishes EASYnet from any other network.   This is the
    result of both the product we use (DECnet) and the people who support
    the network on a daily basis.

    During this same time, the impact of the network has significantly
    increased.  People need network access to do their jobs effectively.
    And, in addition to being an integral part of Digital's business
    processes, EASYnet serves as a testbed and showcase of our networking
    products and services.

    I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to be
    associated with this network, and hope that I can continue to
    contribute to the continuing success of EASYnet.  I'd like to thank
    each of you for your contribution in this effort.

Subj:   Variant on the "hot computer" theme

From RISKS-FORUM Digest  Wednesday 23 December 1987  Volume 5 : Issue 82

The following "SAFE-ALERT" form was distributed at Goddard Space Flight Center
(NASA - Greenbelt, MD) about cleaning PC's.  The date was 7/29/87, alert number
X7-S-87-01.

"Recently an employee of this installation was cleaning his personal computer
screen with a glass cleaner when the screen caught on fire.

The computer had been in use for some time and had built up a static charge.
When the employee went to wipe off the glass cleaner with a tissue, his finger
hit the screen.  This action discharged the static charge causing a spark which
ignited the alcohol in the window cleaner.  A total of 8 personal computers
were checked, with only 1 other catching on fire."

The installation mentioned above was the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, CA.

The action taken was to inform the employees about what could happen, and ask
them to use a non-flammable cleaner.  If there was a need for a flammable
cleaner, then employees were advised to discharge the computer before
spraying.

                "AT&amp;T Taking Step to Bolster Computer Line"
                Miller, Michael W. and Schlender, Brenton R.
                WALL STREET JOURNAL, January 7, 1988  PP:2

        AT&amp;T is buying 20% of Sun Microsystems, at a cost of what may
amount to more than $300 million, in a move designed to improve its
computer revenues.  AT&amp;T will purchase 15% of Sun via newly issued shares
in private placements over the next three years.  The remaining 5% will be
shares purchased on the open market.  AT&amp;T will reserve the right to remain
Sun's largest investor, so that if another company purchases more than 20%,
AT&amp;T will be able to purchase the same amount.  The purchase was actually
agreed upon before technology agreements were concluded in October, but
details had to be worked out before it could be announced.  The technology
agreements between the two companies began when Sun agreed to help AT&amp;T
develop new high-performance workstations and minis.  AT&amp;T is also using
the Sun microchip that Sun is pushing as an industry standard.  Industry
analysts are relieved that AT&amp;T is turning to a successful company to help
itself, rather than relying on its own staff.

             ------------------------------------------

Come to the Mill, which is located on Main Street in Maynard, Massachusetts.

Find a place to park.  Unfortunately, the most reliable free parking spots
are located in the big Thompson Street lot (near the mill pond) as far as
possible from the Lab.  Never fear.  Park there anyway.  Enter Building 5 and
follow these ten easy steps through the maze:

 1. Pass the guard station and go up 1/2 a flight of stairs and through the
    door.  This is 5-2.
 2. Turn right and walk to the middle of the long hall, to the second hall
    on the left.  There's a MicroVAX Workstation sign there.
 3. Turn left down this short hallway and pass the vending machines, freight
    elevator, and central staircase.
 4. Go straight ahead down a slightly sloping bridge (it's got black stripes
    on the floor).  You are now in building 4-4.
 5. Turn right and walk the length of building 4.  You'll have to walk around
    a set of steps jutting out into the hallway.
 6. Go down a flight of gray stairs (brand new stairwell) and turn left and
    go up a ramp through the doors on your right.  You are now in building 6.
 7. Follow the hallway left through more doors and walk down the hall.  This
    is the carpet-test hallway.
 8. Turn left and cross the bridge.  This is building 8, floor 3.
 9. Go to the end of the hall, and turn right and then left at the Xerox
    machine.  The Chase conference room is the middle door on the left.

                     Francis the Foolish felt a filial fondness for his
                flawless, fastidious father, Ferdinand the Fourth.
                Following one February fortnight, Francis, feeling
                footloose and frisky, forced his fond father to fork
                over five hundred forty-five farthings, then fled his
                father's fertile fief.  Fleeing to foreign fields,
                Francis finally frittered away his fortune on fickle
                females, firkins of foaming ale, freeloading friends,
                and feasting.

                     Fleeced by those fiendish fellows of the
                fleshpots, and facing fateful failure and famine,
                Francis finally found himself flinging foul feed to the
                swine in a filthy farmyard as a forlorn farmhand.
                Footsore and famished, he fain would have filled his
                flaccid frame with filched food but found it fit for
                only a footman.

                     "Fie!" flared Francis, "My father's flunkies fare
                far finer!"  Fortunately, the frazzled fugitive finally
                faced facts.  Frustrated from failure and fulfilled
                foreboding, he fled forthwith to his faraway family.

                     Falling fatigued at his father's feet, Francis
                feebly phrased his feelings:  "Father," he fumbled,
                "I've flunked -- and fruitlessly forfeited family
                favor.... ...forgive me!"  The far-sighted father,
                forestalling future family fissures, flagged his
                flunkies.  "Fetch a fatling from the flock and fix a
                feast for Francis!  Fall to!  Faster!"

                     Frederick the Feculent, Francis' feisty,
                fault-finding brother, frowned upon his father's
                forgiveness of Francis' former philandering.  "Flog the
                flounder!" he fumed.  But the faithful felt that
                Francis' former foibles should be freely forgiven.
                "Filial fidelity is what fathers are for, Frederick,"
                said Ferdinand with feelings flowing.  "Forsooth! the
                fugitive is found, so what forbids festivity?  Fly the
                flags freely, amid fifes, fiddles and fanfare....
                ...fling a feast!!!"

                     Francis, face flushed, forswore frippery
                forevermore by forcing his frame into a friar's frock.

"By Ben Stewart, Special to the Globe"
Ben Stewart recently retired from teaching science to elementary school
students at the Jefferson Elementary School in St. Louis.
************************

Take one class of elementary school students, mix it thoroughly with several
pounds of scientific facts. Then shake it up with an examination and you have
the perfect formula for instant "youngsterisms" about science.

The beguiling ideas about science quoted here were gleaned from essays, exams,
and class room discussions; most were from fifth- and sixth-graders. They
illustrate Mark Twain's contention that the "most interesting information comes
from children, for they tell all they know and then stop."

Question: What is one horsepower? Answer: One horsepower is the amount of
energy it takes to drag a horse 500 feet in one second.

You can listen to thunder after lightening and tell how close you came to
getting hit. If you don't hear it you got hit, so never mind.

Talc is found in rocks and on babies.

The law of gravity says no fair jumping up without coming back down.

When they broke open molecules, they found they were only stuffed with atoms.
But when they broke open atoms, they found them stuffed with explosions.

Clouds are high flying fogs.

When people run around and around in circles we say they are crazy. When
planets do it we say they are orbiting.

Rainbows are just to look at, not to really understand.

While the earth seems to be knowingly keeping its distance from the sun, it is
really only centrificating.

Some day we may discover how to make magnets that can point in any direction.

South America has cold summers and hot winters, but somehow they still manage.

Most books now say our sun is a star. But it still knows how to change back
into a sun in the daytime.

Water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. There are 180 degrees
between freezing and boiling because there are 180 degrees between north and
south.

A vibration is a motion that cannot make up its mind which way it wants to go.

There are 26 vitamins in all, but some of the letters are yet to be discovered.
Finding them all means living forever.

There is a tremendous weight pushing down on the center of the Earth because of
so much population stomping around up there these days.

Lime is a green-tasting rock.

Many dead animals of the past changed to fossils while others preferred to be
oil.

Genetics explain why you look like your father and if you don't why you should.

Vacuums are nothings. We only mention them to let them know we know they're
there.

Some oxygen molecules help fires burn while others help make water, so
sometimes it's brother against brother.

Some people can tell what time it is by looking at the sun. But I have never
been able to make out the numbers.

We say the cause of perfume disappearing is evaporation. Evaporation gets
blamed for a lot of things people forget to put the top on.

To most people solutions mean finding the answers. But to chemists solutions
are things that are still all mixed up.

In looking at a drop of water under a microscope, we find there are twice as
many H's as O's.

I am not sure how clouds get formed. But the clouds know how to do it, and that
is the important thing.

Clouds just keep circling the Earth around and around. And around. There is not
much else to do.

Water vapor gets together in a cloud. When it is big enough to be called a
drop, it does.

When there is fog, you might as well not mind looking at it.

Humidity is the experience of looking for air and finding water.

We keep track of the humidity in the air so we won't drown when we breathe.

In making rain water, it takes everything from H to O.

When rain water strikes forest fires, it heckstingwishes them. Luckily it
affects we of the humans unlike that.

Rain is often spoken of as soft water, oppositely known as hail.

Rain is saved up in cloud banks.

In some rocks you can find the fossil footprints of fishes.

Cyanide is so poisonous that one drop of it on a dog's tongue will kill the
strongest man.

A blizzard is when it snows sideways.

A hurricane is a breeze of a bigly size.

A monsoon is a French gentleman.

A thunderstorm is like a shower, only moreso.

Thunder is a rich source of loudness.

Isotherms and isobars are even more important that their names sound.

It is so hot in some parts of the world that the people there have to live
other places.

The wind is like the air, only pushier.

Question: In what ways are we dependant on the sun? Answer: We can always
depend on the sun for sunburn and tidal waves.

Until it is decided whether tornadoes are typhoons or hurricanes, we must
continue to call them tornadoes.
