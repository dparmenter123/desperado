Well, I was driving home from Boston with two desperadi (who shall
remain nameless to save them from public humiliation) and both
swore to me that we were seeing the Northern Lights driving up
Route 3.  I was looking at the world through one distinctly unrosecolored
contact lens, so I believed 'em.  Turned out we were viewing the floodlights
over the newly erected Burger King American Flag at Drum Hill.  Does
that count?  It's as close to nature as I ever TRY to get.

Having lived through the August 17, 1959 earthquake (Richter 7.9) in south-
western Montana makes one glad merely to be alive and somewhat less interested
in experiencing exotic natural phenomena.  That earthquake killed only 27 peo-
ple, but it did so by dumping several cubic miles of mountain on them, creating
a new lake by damming the Gallatin River several hundred feet deep.  The US
Army Corps of Engineers dug a spillway to prevent the inadvertent flooding of
the lower Gallatin Valley.  The quake also raised the west side of Hebgen Lake
(more than a mile across) by seven feet and lowered the east side by the same
amount.

My dear friend Ann Jensen was camping in Yellowstone Park August 15,
1959.  They woke up the morning of the 16th to find their campsite
criss-crossed with bear tracks and decided to leave.  The next day
the campsite was covered 75 feet deep with rubble.

Your family has indeed been gifted with experience.  I must admit, I have
never seen a twister, though I'd like to.  I have seen the Northern Lights,
a moving experience made all the nicer because I saw them in Maine.

I too have been in the eye of a hurricane.  Several in fact, since I grew
up in Mobile -- the first city in the United States to celebrate Mardi
Gras.  But I must tell you that the real eye of the hurricane has no breezes.
The sky turns a uniformly pale yellow, the winds stop, and you can hear a
cricket cough.  In the early sixties, a famous hurricane (Flossie) came tearing
through Mobile flooding the streets and uprooting full-grown oaks.  Then it
turned around after heading about 75 miles inland, regained all dissipated
momentum, and sashayed through the city once more.  My barber live a mile or
so away in an Airstream trailer.  Fortunately, he and his wife took shelter
elsewhere because Flossie pulled up a fifty foot oak and dropped it in a
perfect perpendicular on top of the trailer.

Natural fury is thrilling, often times frightening, but wonderous to behold.
Man's penchant for destruction is puny by comparison.

<b>My</b> hurricane eye had a light breeze.  Although the eye is calm
compared to the hurricane, there is no reason that a pocket of air
several miles across should not have local winds in it, eye or no.

Witnessing Natural Phenomena
----------------------------

Once I viewed a 98% Solar eclipse (but didn't have a car to travel to the
site of the other 2%). I also saw the last Lunar eclipse (because my
daughter woke up at 5AM for a glass of water). Once as a eager 8th grader,
I shivered my way through part of a Midnite meteor shower. I even stood
out on my front lawn during the eye of a hurricane.

BUT -- I would never stand on the beach during a hurricane. They have the
nasty habit of causing tidal surges, which wash viewers out to sea.

I was once lucky enough to experience a tornado without being one of
the poor unfortunates in its path.   Tornado alerts are not that unusual
in Kentucky, but Louisville, being in somewhat of a shallow valley, was
usually spared.

I was out delivering newspapers one afternoon in 1974, and remember feeling
an erie stillness in the air.  I looked up to see what looked like a thick,
coal-black cloud tumbling overhead.  It was moving along pretty quickly and
didn't make a sound.

When I came home I learned that a tornado had touched down in several
places in the city, and fortunately had passed over our neighborhood.
I set out on my Honda to respond to an emergency call for blood donors,
and then roamed the city to inspect the aftermath first hand.

The destruction done by a tornado is awesome not only in its completeness,
but in its selectivity and the distinctness of the edges of its path.
Bare foundations sat next to houses without even a broken window.  The
neighborhoods hit looked as if a 200-foot wide Lawnboy rolled through them.

Cherokee Park used to be a couple of square miles of venerable old trees
and lush greenness, and was a place to "hang-out" in high school, and a
sanctuary in which to get lost from everything when you needed to be alone.
It was unsettling to see 300-year old trees disrespectfully scattered about
like jackstraws, and to realize that because of a mere five minutes, an old
refuge wouldn't be the same again in my lifetime.

Subject: A weather (fish?) story for DESPERADO

In the recent DESPERADO, somebody mentioned his favorite disasters.  Well,
having that veritable gauntlet slapped in my face, I've no choice but to
join the Honorable Society of We Who Have Know the Full Fury of Mother
Nature (acronym lovers, rejoice!  The HSWWHKFFMN!), otherwise known as
'who can spin the biggest, yet still plausible, yarn'.

Both of my initiations into the HSWWHKFFMN came in Bozeman, MT, during the
mid 1970's, while I was attending Montana State University.  The first
episode came when I watched a tornado trot across the ground towards my
hiding place (a hole in the ground, since I was in a field), and lift not
more than 400 feet from where I was.

The second, and I still get cold thinking about it, was Superbowl Sunday
of 1977, when I had to fix my TV antenna on the roof.  Since I had to deal
with some rather small wires, I had my gloves off a great deal of the time.
When I got back down off the roof, my hands were actually blue!  It turned
out that, had I bothered to look, I wouldn't have gone up on the roof in the
first place.  My thermometer was sheltered from the wind, yet exposed par-
tially to the sun (what sun there was).  The readings from my Captain Marvel
Secret Decoder Weather Station: -46 degrees Farenheit, and 40 mph winds!

Hurray to your fourth grade teacher for making you remember that it's
its that doesn't have the apostrophe, but she's wrong about the reason.

The lack of the apostrophe on the possessive pronoun "its" is NOT an
exception.  There's no apostrophe on any possessive pronoun: my, your,
his, her, its, our, your, and their.  However, when it's a contraction
of "it is" that you're dealing with, the apostrophe is used to indicate
the missing letters.

From: MILVAX::FRIBERG
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER
Subject: About apostrophes--

  The possesive 'its' is the same type of pronoun as 'his' and 'hers'.
  The contraction 'it's' is really two words, 'it' and 'is'. They are
  not even remotely related.

  Also incorrect is the use of apostrophes in plurals such as
        "The Miller's". (Correct: The Millers)
  Use of the apostrophe here is incorrect. Apostrophes are not necessary
  for pluralization for most nouns. Cases where this is most unclear
  include acronyms and words already ending with s, but the same rules
  do apply.

  If you are talking about something that belongs to the Millers, the
  apostrophe goes after the 's', since it is assume that said article
  belongs to all the Millers. ("The Millers' boat...")

  I find that most often people use apostrophes where they do not belong
  rather than leave them out where they do belong. They are proper only
  to create contractions of two words and in possessive nouns. ('It' is
  a pronoun.)

Subject: its versus it's, once more with feeling

        Olde English nouns had cases galore, and several patterns
(declensions to the cognescenti) to follow.  Most of this went away,
and we are left with the merest remnants.  They sound like a base form,
or root, and the base + S-sound (sometimes a Z-sound).  The latter
indicates plurality, or possession, or both.  In conversation, you
can usually figure out what is meant.  In writing, though, you can't
ask the author to rephrase things.  Ye olde Scribes Guild figured out
punctuation to make this (and other things) clear.  The curve above
the word (that's what "apostrophe" means, from Greek roots) indicates
possession.
        Now the Pronouns persisted in all their glory, indicating
number, case, (and sometimes gender too), so there never was any need
to distinguish one form from another. Thus "its", "his", "hers"
don't need anything extra written down.  Sure, they have a final S,
and it does indicate possesion, but they are unique, unlike any other
form of the pronouns.
        (An aside: the Modern English pronouns do not derive from the
Old English pronouns.  They are the result of the Danish invasion,
before 1066 and all that, and they are more related to Old Norse
than to Old English.  An anomaly, since usually invaders don't
change such basic stuff as pronouns, numbers, prepositions.)
        Contractions came a little later, and spoiled the nice
parsing of written text. For example, "the army's winning,"
could be a complete sentence, with a parallel sentence expected next,
or it could be a noun phrase, with expectations of a digressionary
clause, followed by some verb.

And, for closers on this fascinating topic - "Dear Aunt Mary, Thank
you for the book about penguins.  It tells me more about penguins than
I want to know." - here is the very first rule of usage from Strunk's
"Elements of Style":

        1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

        Follow this rule whatever the final consonant.  Thus write,

                Charles's friend
                Burns's poems
                the witch's malice

        Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in "-es"
        and "-is", the possessive "Jesus'" and such forms as "for
        conscience' sake", "for righteousness' sake".  But such forms as
        "Moses' Laws", "Isis' temple" are commonly replaced by

                the Laws of Moses
                the temple of Isis

Why I don't lose sleep when I find out that a minority of people don't
know how to tie their shoe laces:

I just love the perrenial stories about professors who are disgusted
that one kind of a student or another can't place locations on the map,
can't name his state senators, don't know where their appendix is, can't
name the ten commandments, can't name the nine planets, can't identify
the opening line of Moby Dick, or who can't whistle the opening phrase
of Beethoven's fifth.

Now, far be it from me to point out that none of these skills is of the
least importance to feeding, breeding or having a "lifestyle".  Far be it
from me to say that people who make their living knowing where Miami is
(airline pilots and football teams, that sort of thing) invariably KNOW
where Miami is because it is relevant to them.  Let's look at the sort
of professor who puts test like this together.  This is a man who is
hunting.

You don't just wake up in the morning and say, "I wonder how many people
know where Miami is?"  This professor is grinding an ax. 8.5 percent
of the people can't find Miami?  8.5 percent?  Really?  My, I'll bet
that makes the other 91.5% pretty smart.  I'll bet it makes the professor
pretty smart, because he found out.  Might even get his name in the
papers.  And certainly, it can't be his fault if a given course is a
flop, because this proves that SOMEONE ELSE in the educational chain
didn't do good job preparing the student.  Not him.  Not his job to
teach place names, n'est pas?

No need to worry about future mapmakers, politicians or travel agents.
Mapmakers CARE where places are, and will know.  Travel agents just
write out the tickets that get you to where you're going, and don't have
to know latitude and longitude.  (A travel agent who had never been to
the Bahamas told me where to find the most beautiful beach I have ever
seen.  She knew all about WHAT was there, but had no idea WHERE I was
going.)  Politicians are responsible for naming places. Places ARE where
they say.  Not only have they defined the boundaries of Miami, they have
CHANGED them several times.

I wonder what kind of numbers we'd come up with if we tried to find out
how many people can tie their own bow tie?  How many people know when
you wear a dinner jacket, and when you wear tails?  Where does the
dessert fork go in a place setting?  How do you conjugate the Latin verb
"sum"?

How do these things differ from the location of Miami?  They used to be
important, but aren't anymore.  The location of Miami is not important,
and never has been.
