 The decidedly low-rent Ginsana ginseng capsules has an ad asking
 folks what they would do if they had more energy (presumably from
 popping their pills.  All sorts of mundanity results -- spend more
 time with the kids, play basketball, get another job -- then, right
 at the end, a voice pops up stating that he would play Cajun Bach.  A
 cello cranks up a little Bach in the background that quickly morphs
 into two or three bars of Cajun sounds.

 I was looking at car radios the other day and I asked the
 salesman his opinion on factory speakers:  "Factory speakers
 are so lousy even the factory radio can blow them out."

 I thought immediately, "Microsoft Windows is so lousy even
 Microsoft applications can crash it."

Possible original saying:

 "You can't dig your way out of a hole.
  Digging is how you got *into* the hole."

 Hair Club for Men is always good for a gag -- real ha-ha like the
 programming-the-VCR gags -- so when I heard the ad for Hair Club for
 Kids I thought it might be more of the same, but in fact Hair Club
 for Men provides free service for child cancer patients who have lost
 their hair in chemotherapy.

 So, I got caught by Dave Barry, but http://ghg.ecn.purdue.edu/ is one
 hell of a web page nonetheless.

 And, http://reality.sgi.com/employees/dbg_asd/antics/index.html
 provides even more amateur pyrotechnics.

From the New Yorker, Aug. 14, letters to the editor:

   Rough Trade

   Editor's Note:  A mistake made by a transcription service mangled a
   quotation from William Bennett in Michael Kelly's July 17th Letter
   from Washington.  In criticizing the political views of Patrick
   Buchanan, Mr. Bennett said "it's a real us-and-them kind of thing,"
   not, as we reported, "it's a real S &amp; M kind of thing."

 Bunch of short items from me, followed in succeeding mail by separate
 stacks  of googolmania and browsermania.  You may recall that the
 terms of Desperado are basically what's interesting to me that I
 think some canonical subscriber or two would also be interested in,
 shipped in the firm belief that every mail system has a delete
 function.
