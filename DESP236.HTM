        I am E.C. Fan-Addict #22376.  When I was in the eighth grade in
        about 1954 I used to go down to the Barnes drug store, clear
        across the tracks of the Georgia &amp; Florida Railroad, to apply for
        my copy of Mad Comics.  No more than half a dozen were delivered
        to Valdosta, Georgia, and one was allocated to me.  I bought Panic
        too, of course, and for several years previously I was a regular
        with Tales From the Crypt, Vault of Horror, and sporadic pickups
        of other horror and war comics from Entertaining Comics (nei
        Educational Comics), without doubt the finest line of comic books
        ever issued.  Being a fan-addict got me a pin, patch, wallet card,
        and certificate.  I still have the last two and I'm still a
        fan-addict.

        EC was hounded out of the comic-book business by the anti-fun
        forces, which is when I became a First Amendment fan-addict, and
        so I remain.  The founder of EC, William Gaines, made a brilliant
        comeback by creating Mad Magazine.  It is characteristic of the
        anti-fun forces that they think that if they can define things
        tightly enough, there will be no badness in the world. (I have an
        anti-obscenity ordinance somewhere in my hardcopy archives that is
        outrageously earnest in its efforts to indicate just how much
        aureola can be allowed to show before society comes tumbling
        down.)  In this case, the anti-fun definition of badness was color
        comic books, so when Gaines came out with a black-and-white
        magazine, they had no comeback.  If they tried to crush him now,
        they'd have to define their way around out of hassling Life
        magazine, which was not so far past its "Nude of the Week"
        feature.  They couldn't figure out how to do it, so Mad Magazine
        raved on and raves on to this day.

        From Mad, the kids of America learn that the whole damn business of
        life and importance and entertainment is a load of formula crap
        that anyone with half a brain can see right through.  I don't read
        it every month any more, but I still pick up a Mad every once in a
        while and it is still out there undermining everything that
        society believes in.  Sample:  Mad is the only mag in the world
        that has consistently made fun of dopers *and* made fun of anti-drug
        laws.  Some people inexplicably believe that things are on the up
        and up, but nobody who reads Mad thinks that.

        William Gaines died the other day, but it looks like Mad is gonna
        roll right along, the strangest beast in all the Time-Warner zoo,
        biting the hand that feeds it and any other hand that's handy.
        Sure, it's a formula, but that's what makes me think it can
        survive Gaines, if they hang on to his vision (easy, we all do)
        and his courage (harder, but we all want to).

        What?  Me worry?

        Magazine, and flag-burning.  A great day for patriotism.

        The All Things Considered story on the Elvis stamp was nice.
        They'd been mentioning throughout the program that the story was
        coming up:  "The Post Office announced the results today of the
        Elvis stamp competition.  After all, what else could it have
        been?"  They then played Elvis singing "Young and Beautiful" with
        just a piano accompaniment.  All the way through.  That was it.

                                    =*=

        All Things Considered used to do a lot more of that.  Too bad.

        I heard a financial talk show host raving the other day that the
        most important issues in the presidential campaign were the
        savings&amp;loan scandal, the deficit, and the ripoff of the Social
        Security trust fund, but that the Democrats and Republicans were
        both so deeply enmeshed in these that they didn't dare let them
        become issues.

        Perot is talking about them.  Maybe he can smoke the others out.

        Sister Souljah ought to turn all the profits from last week on

        Rap music is functioning like horror comics did, helping kids deal
        with reality.  This always bugs the anti-fun forces.  They not
        only like precision in their definitions of badness, they also
        like fuzz in their definitions of goodness.  Warm fuzz, actually.

Subject: PC Week editorial compares operating systems to political candidates

Operating systems were compared to current presidential candidates in
a PC Week editorial.

MS-DOS  -  George Bush.  The current incumbent;  doesen't do much, but
           still in charge.

DR-DOS  -  Pat Buchanan.  Expected to be a strong contender, but
           turned out not to be.

Windows 3.1  -  Bill Clinton.  All media glitz and marketing; but not
                much substance.

OS/2 2.0 -  Paul Tsongas.  Thought to be gone, but revived by strong
            showing in big cities, and poor competition.  Best technically,
            but needs better marketing.

Windows NT  -  Bill Bradley.  The exciting new future.  Still an
               unknown.

Mac -  Jerry Brown.  California- different.

Unix  -  Mario Cuomo.  You always think its about to run and take off,
         but then nothing.

   You have to wonder what it means that Bill Clinton, Andre Marrou, and
   Jerry Brown have such similar addresses.

Fans of the movie "Buckaroo Banzai" will recall that the Red Lectroids
employed at Yoyodyne Industries had sequential social security
numbers.  So the answer here is obvious:  Clinton, Marrou, and Brown
are aliens from outer space.  Clinton and Marrou have done a better
job of hiding it, of course.

"His blackboard technique puts Rembrandt to shame."

 Someone with a knowledge of English should proofread it."

"Have you ever fell asleep in class and awoke in another?
 That's the way I felt all term."

"[In class] I learn I can fudge answers and get away with it."

"Keep lecturer or tenure board will be shot."

"The recitation instructor would make a good parking lot attendant.
 Tries to tell you where to go, but you can never understand him."

"[TA's are] enthusiastic, clear...and enjoy the interactions with
 students...(what are they doing teaching here?)"

"[Lecturer] likes to call on people.  Don't yawn!
 To him, yawn = raised hand."

"Text is useless.  I use it to kill roaches in my room."

"[In class] the syllabus is more important than you are."

"I am convinced that you can learn by osmosis by just sitting in his
class."

 would have used the text."

"What's the quality of the text?  `Text is printed on high quality
paper.'"

"The absolute value of the TA was less than epsilon."

        There is no way to be sure this is legit or a clever pastiche, but
        then I'm not sure I should care.  If for real, it demonstrates that
        Doctor Wildmon has a good handle on his subject matter and cares
        passionately about it.  You have to remember that believing in the
        Devil isn't something he does to annoy and amuse sophisticates.
        The Devil and God are wrestling for the world and Dr. Wildmon is
        on God's team.  On the other hand, if not for real, the idea that
        fundamentalist yahoos are hauling out the feathers and tar for
        talk.bizarre is appropriately bizarre.talk.

Thought y'all might get a kick out of this if you haven't seen it.  It
has already seen pretty wide distribution on the net.  The thing that
gets me about this sort of tirade is that it simply spreads the sort
of thing that it is supposed to be stopping the spread of.  Of course
I know I'm continuing to spread it, but *I* don't mind.  In fact,
while reading this, I was never really sure that the original writer
wasn't writing tongue-in-cheek, basically touting the wild perversity
of talk.bizarre, etc.  I guess that's just one of those authorial
intent dilemmas that the deconstructionists find so trite, but I
wondered about it for awhile nonetheless.

&gt;PROJECT TO FIGHT TALK.BIZARRE NEWSGROUP
&gt;
&gt;Dear Friend,
&gt;
&gt;     I'm asking you to take some very important actions.
&gt;
&gt;     You'll find them listed below.
&gt;
&gt;     Your actions today will help fight one of USENET's most offensive
&gt;     "news groups"--TALK.BIZARRE--the suppurating abcess of the INTERNET.
&gt;
&gt;     If you've never read talk.bizarre, it's time you do.  You must know what
&gt;     lessons talk.bizarre teaches millions of college students every day.
&gt;
&gt;     In truth, TALK.BIZARRE is so bad, entertainer Reggie Carson has come out
&gt;     strongly against it.  Here's what he tells system administrators:
&gt;
&gt;    "TALK.BIZARRE promotes the most violent of acts in front of our users.
&gt;     If parents saw someone peddling hard-core pornography to their,
&gt;     children, they'd have them arrested.  That's what TALK.BIZARRE does."
&gt;
&gt;     TALK.BIZARRE is a cancer eating away at the moral fiber of our young.
&gt;
&gt;     In fact, TALK.BIZARRE is such a dangerous threat to young students
&gt;     that net.celebrity DRIEUX warned us, saying :
&gt;

[spaces between words added by yr. bdy]

&gt;     "The central message of most of these posts are clear:
&gt;     Human happiness and fulfillment are experienced by becoming
&gt;     a sociopath and rejecting all responsibility.  If we continue
&gt;     to sow the images of murder, violence, drug abuse, sadism,
&gt;     arrogance, irreverence, blasphemy, perversion, pornography
&gt;     and aberration before the eyes of millions of computer user, we
&gt;     should not be surprised if the foundations of our society rot
&gt;     away as if from leprosy."
&gt;
&gt;     TALK.BIZARRE teaches these lessons by design.  TALK.BIZARRE
&gt;     old-timers say they have a "mandate" to help form and shape
&gt;     the values of young news readers.
&gt;
&gt;     A Los Angeles Daily News article quoted TALK.BIZARRE
&gt;     creative director RICHH as follows:
&gt;
&gt;     "We have articulated our responsibility concerning our MANDATE
&gt;     to lead, serve and reflect our young audience."
&gt;
&gt;     What "mandate?"  TALK.BIZARRE has no "mandate" to teach our users.  What
&gt;     parents in their right minds would turn their children over to people
&gt;     who teach lessons like this:
&gt;
&gt;     A recent post had a young woman, Amy Kahn
&gt;     (kahn@xxxxx.xxxx.xxxxx.xxx) offering herself to the highest bidder
&gt;     on the net.

[Dr. Wildmon included the full net address!]

&gt;
&gt;     Once she did so, a post entitled "Re: Satan" showed up. This post--
&gt;     about a penis possesed by the devil--WAS AVAILABLE TO A CAPTIVE
&gt;     AUDIENCE OF CHILDREN!
&gt;
&gt;     That, my friend, is not an isolated incident.
&gt;
&gt;     Reggie Carson would not risk professional blacklisting over an
&gt;     isolated posting.  DRIEUX would not speak out against the dangers of
&gt;     TALK.BIZARRE from wetware.com over an isolated article.
&gt;
&gt;     TALK.BIZARRE is on a mission to sell our youth the values of drugs,
&gt;     violence, sex, and hedonism.  TALK.BIZARRE posters thoroughly reject
&gt;     traditional morals and values.
&gt;
&gt;     Join the fight to get TALK.BIZARRE off the net and out of our sites.
&gt;
&gt;     TALK.BIZARRE is available on nearly every net in America.  BUT KEEP
&gt;     THIS IN MIND:  Even if you don't have a newsfeed, cable, and even if
&gt;     you don't read TALK.BIZARRE, and even if you don't allow your users
&gt;     to subscribe to TALK.BIZARRE.
&gt;
&gt;     .....the fact remains that TALK.BIZARRE is fed into 54.5 MILLION COMPUTERS
&gt;     in America alone. And you and I and our users must live with the people
&gt;     who watch AND ACT OUT the lessons they learn on TALK.BIZARRE.
&gt;
&gt;     So decide today to help fight TALK.BIZARRE.  Take these actions:
&gt;
&gt;     (1)  Call your upstream newsfeed and ask them to quit
&gt;          carrying TALK.BIZARRE over your network.
&gt;
&gt;     (2)  If they say they can't do that, ask them to censor the
&gt;          TALK.BIZARRE group and make it an "adults only" group subscribers
&gt;          receive only by request.
&gt;
&gt;     (3)  If they say they can't do that, tell them to immediately
&gt;          make TALK.BIZARRE a "moderated" group so no one from your
&gt;          site can post to it.
&gt;
&gt;     (4)  If they refuse to do that, bite the bullet and CANCEL YOUR
&gt;          NEWSFEED.  Believe me, you can live without USENET news.
&gt;
&gt;     (5)  Reproduce and distribute among your church members, friends,
&gt;          family, and others the enclosed petition concerning
&gt;          TALK.BIZARRE.
&gt;
&gt;     (6)  Whether or not you get USENET news, SIGN the enclosed postcards to
&gt;          NETCOM and INTEL and MAIL THEM today.
&gt;
&gt;          NETCOM and INTEL are two leading sources of TALK.BIZARRE  There
&gt;          is absolutely no reason for them to help pay for the filth on
&gt;          TALK.BIZARRE. It is time to get angry at these two companies
&gt;          who tell us they are concerned with the kinds of computer
&gt;          services they help pay for.
&gt;
&gt;          Thank you for taking this action today.  You are helping rid
&gt;society of a deadly menace.  Better still, you are helping to protect
&gt;the hearts and minds of our children from the prowling lion called
&gt;TALK.BIZARRE.
&gt;
&gt;     In closing let me once again thank you for all the support you have
&gt;given and continue to give our AFA ministry.
&gt;
&gt;     Your ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT in our projects, your PRAYERS for me and
&gt;the success of our work, and your FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS are making a
&gt;tremendous difference.  People are waking up.  People are getting
&gt;involved.
&gt;
&gt;     Please keep up your valuable and irreplaceable support.  And
&gt;whenever you can, contribute to the success of our work.  As I have told
&gt;you many, many times, fully 99.9% of our funding comes from the generous
&gt;sacrifices supporters like you make.  Thank you for this help.  Without
&gt;you, there would be no AFA.
&gt;
&gt;     God bless you, my friend, and your loved ones, too.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Donald E. Wildmon
&gt;
&gt;P.S.  I know that you, as I do, get tired fighting this never-ending
&gt;battle.  But we simply must not quit.  God never gives up on us.  For
&gt;the sake of those who come after us, let us resolve to continue fighting
&gt;the good fight.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Wildmon sounds absolutely propellor-headed in parts of this,
        tossing around terms like "posts" and "feeds" and "Believe me you
        can live without usenet news".  On the other hand, who the hell
        (or heaven) is "entertainer Reggie Carson" or "net.celebrity
        DRIEUX"?  And does talk.bizarre really serve "millions"?  Do they
        really talk dirtier at Intel and Netcom?

        In protecting children from filth,  the window of needed
        protection is very small, even if you wholeheartedly accept the
        idea.  It's only between the ages of 11 and 13 that the protection
        is meaningful.  Before that age, they aren't interested and after
        that age they're beginning their own research.  However, there is
        such a thing as imprinting, and if you happen to have an erotic
        experience involving a vacuum cleaner or raincoat or body odor at
        a certain age, you may find your romantic life taking an entirely
        unexpected turn.

The following item appeared in Sunday's New York Times, front page:

        WALL OF SILENCE IMPEDES INQUIRY INTO A ROWDY NAVY CONVENTION

        WOMEN DESCRIBE ASSAULTS BY DRUNKEN AVIATORS

        (By Eric Schmitt, Special to the New York Times)

        WASHINGTON, June 12 -- On a warm Saturday night last September,
        Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett 3d chatted with Navy pilots
        on a patio outside the Las Vegas Hilton, where military aviators,
        flush from their victory in the Person Gulf, were celebrating
        at a three day convention.

        Just inside, hundreds of officers -- lured by the prospect of
        free drinks, free food, and a chance to share war stories with
        old buddies -- roamed the third-floor "hospitality suites" rented
        by aircraft squadrons.  Strippers and scantily clad bartenders
        worked the 20 suites, where Navy and Marine Corps pilots watched
        pornographic movies.  Male streakers dashed about, and in one
        suite, officers goaded female guests to drink from a dispenser
        shaped like a rhinoceros penis.  [...]

        [...]while Mr. Garrett socialized on the patio just outside, some
        of the Navy's most elite young officers were mauling and
        manhandling female colleagues and civilian women, shoving them
        down a gauntlet they had formed in the crowded corridor.[...]

        The activities in that hallway over three nights last September
        are at the heart of the military's most notorious sexual
        harassment scandal, and the sordid events have come to symbolize
        the "Top Gun" mentality that not only engages in such lewdness
        but even condones it as nothing extraordinary.[...]

Now contrast this with a comment that appeared in an article entitled
"Reinventing the Superhero for an Unsequal" (about the new movie "Batman
Returns"), by Ryan Murphy, in The Boston Globe, pg. B33, also on Sunday:

        "I mean, there's something very uncomplicated about a man dressing
        up as a superhero.  You expect that.  But with a woman, it's a
        different thing.  In every man, there's an urge to protect society,
        and in every woman, there's an urge to make it come crashing down."

My wife tells me that part about making it come crashing down is essential
to the point (it was her suggestion that prompted this whole thing).  I
suppose she's right, but what do I know, being descended from dead white
European males....

And then there's an item for the "No shit, Sherlock" department.  On the
front page of the Sunday New York Times is the following:

        WORDS ON BUSH'S LIPS IN '88 NOW STICK IN VOTERS' CRAW

        by Jeffrey Schmalz

        Fed up with politics and politicians, many Americans have siezed on
        one catch phrase as a symbol of their disgust, repeating it over
        and over like a sarcastic mantra, "Read my lips: No new taxes."

        In interviews with hundreds of votors around the coutnry in the
        last five months, the slogan, which was the bedrock of George
        Bush's 1988 campaign for President, was uttered time and again by
        votors angered not so much that their taxes had increased as that
        Mr. Bush had lied to them, breaking not a routine promise but
        a sacred compact.

        But the political fallout seems to extend far beyond Mr. Bush.  If
        so strong a commitment by the President of the United States cannot
        be trusted, amny people seem to think, then no politician or his
        word is good.  As a result, the President's reversal seems to have
        hurt Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumed Democratic nominee.
        And it seems to have helped open the way for a Ross Perot.
        ...
        No one seems more taken aback at the sweep of the reaction than
        political insiders.  After all, they had thought, the pledge not to
        raise taxes was so obviously impossible to keep that no one took it
        seriously.  But in their public opinion research, they are finding
        that people took it quite seriously and that they viewed it as the
        ultimate test of whether a politician's word was any good.

        "I think a lot of us didn't have a sense of just how serious a
        pledge George Bush had broken," said Peter D. Hart, a longtime
        Democratic poll taker who is conducting surveys and discussion
        groups for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News.  "Now I'm finding
        that it's cost him more than anything else and hurt politicians
        in general.  The promise was as close as a politician can come to
        putting an imprint in Grauman's Chinese Theater.  The votors took
        it as a blood oath.  How can a politician take a blood oath to the
        voters again?"...

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        I'm not surprised that people are mad about it, but I am *amazed*
        that anyone believed Bush in the first place.  It was obviously a
        lie.  Nobody believed Jimmy Carter when he said he'd never lie, so
        why did they believe Bush (a much less trustworthy fellow) when he
        said something that just plain couldn't and wouldn't be true.

        Incidentally, it is hilarious for Bush, former Director of Central
        Intelligence, to be beefing about Perot hiring private detectives
        to check up on Bush.  Of course, Perot hired private detectives to
        check up on his own children, an understandable, though
        reprehensible, impulse.

   "Flora pounced on some books which lay on the broad window-sill....

        A great book.  When it came out, all the "intense" passages were
        printed in purple ink.  Hilarious encounter between a "modern"
        young woman and a bunch of atavists on a farm in darkest Britain.
        It's one of those satires that was better, and longer-lived, than
        the original target: novels about primitive rural life.  Also a
        great PBS miniseries from the days before I had a VCR, alas.

Bible scholars have long wondered how old Isaac was when his father
Abraham took him up to the mountain top to offer him as a sacrifice.
Through careful study of the story as related in the Old Testament,
based on the following facts:

       1) Isaac was old enough to understand the ritual of sacrifice,
       2) Issac was old enough to carry wood for the fire to the top
          of the mountain,
       3) Issac was old enough to notice that they were not bringing
          an animal for the sacrifice.

   Therefore Issac's age, at this time, was greater than 8 years old.
Scholars  also conclude that he was younger than 12 years old as
supported by the following fact:

       If Isaac had been older than twelve, he would have been a
       teenager and it would not have been a sacrifice.

&gt;From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

A Pentecostal minister from Armstrong County wants her son's middle school
to ban an award-winning book because it contains the word "demon".

State Elder Sylvia Hall of Kiski Township said in an interview last week that
the book, "Dragonwings", could lead children astray.  "The word 'demon' does
not mean anything good", she said.  "Every page uses the word 'demon'.  It's
a form of brainwashing."

...

"You're talking about young, tender minds," Hall said.  "You can't guarantee
that some kid won't be asked to go to a demon meeting tonight and say, 'Oh,
that's OK.  We learned about that in school.'"

...

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        My guess is that the demons were not favorably portrayed.

[This is a repost.  Many people who saw the first part emailed me wondering
if the complete version was ever floated.  It was, but appears to have gone by
a lot of people.  I hope they all catch this one.]

   Some of my friends call me an `improbability vortex' --- the kind of person
weird stuff just naturally happens around.  Occasionally I manage to to forget
why; my life doesn't seem bizarre to *me*.  Then, something happens to remind
me...

   Wednesday, March 25 1992: a fairly ordinary day in the life of Eric Raymond,
Boy Hacker.  Shower, read netnews, phone calls, some revision on the clone
hardware buyer's guide I've been working on for comp.unix.sysv386.  Will the
top ten vendors go for my idea of a competitive "UNIX Dream Machines Bake-Off"?
Hmm...well, Swan Tech wants to sign up, that's a start.  Ah, the mail's in.

   Riffle, riffle.  What's this?  Forwarded from MIT Press.  Something about
the book, no doubt...

   The Book: if you don't know it already, I edited a lexicon called
_The_New_Hacker's_Dictionary_  (MIT Press, 1991, ISBN 0-262-68069-6).  It's
all about hacker language and folklore.  Sold 14,000 copies in its first
seven months, got rave reviews everywhere, good stuff like that.  Got my
first nut-case letter about a month back --- always heard that was supposed
to happen to authors.  Some of the fallout has been weird.  Ouch, fallout ---
*bad* choice of words.  Back to our story.

   Hm.  From ISPNews.  INFOSecurity Product News.  Eh?  Never heard of them;
sounds like some trade rag for professional paranoids.  Computer form on the
inside; addressed to ERIC RAYMOND EDITOR, THE MIT PRESS, MASS INST OF
TECHNOLOGY, CAMBRIDGE MA 02142.  I see what happened; the Press's editorial
address miscegenated with my book credit in someone's mailing-list software,
and some clerical droid at the Press didn't look at content and forwarded
a piece of mail that should have stayed in-house.

   What we've got here is, oh, yeah, must be a report from the magazine's
bingo card.  Reader service; they circle numbers, you get a bunch of product
info requests.  OK, who wants to know about my book?  Maybe I'll give them
a surprise and answer it myself.  They probably all think the book is a how-to
manual for crackers.  Damn all journalists for what they did to the word
"hacker", anyhow...

   There were four.  First one:

   DAVID CARGILL SYSTEMS A
   GUARDIAN LIFE INS
   STE 201
   888 SEVENTH AVE
   NEW YORK         NY 10106

   Oh, boring, I thought to myself.  Actually he turned out not to be; I spoke
with him, later, and the guy turns out to be an old UNIX hand who, when I
explained what the book is really about, cheerfully expatiated on Cargill's
Theory of Fat Electrons.

   See, Con Edison sucks its line current out of the big generators with a pair
of coil taps located near the top of the dynamo.  When the normal tap brushes
get dirty, they take 'em off line to clean up, and use special auxilliary
taps on the *bottom* of the coil.  Now (sez Cargill) this is a problem,
because when they do that they get not ordinary or `thin' electrons, but the
fat'n'sloppy electrons that are heavier and so settle to the bottom of the
generator.  These flow down ordinary wires OK, but when they have to turn a
sharp corner (like in an IC via) they get stuck.  This is what causes computer
glitches.

   I laughed, said "You sound like a man who wants to hear about {quantum
bogodynamics}" and directed him to the on-line version of the book at prep.
Back to our story...

   Next guy...

   BRADLEY H EDWARDS  SEC SPE
   SECURITY-SAFETY
   CONSULTS
   PO BOX 536
   TOPEKA            KS 66601

Well, the phone number attached to this one was out of service.  Security
Specialist, eh?  For sure he's got the cracker/hacker bug on the brain.  Then
my eyeballs tripped over the third address

   PAMELA D MILLER CHIEF
   USSPACE COM
   STOP 4
   J2C/SS0-C
   CHEYENNE MTN AFB  CO 80914

and I went into the mental equivalent of TILT TILT TILT.  Now, any of you who
ain't congenital idiots raised in a rain barrel somewhere on the butt-end of
nowhere will already have decoded that address to "U.S. Space Command, Cheyenne
Mountain Air Force Base".  Yeah, that's right.  NORAD; the big tunnel complex
under the mountain from which they be plannin' to fight World War III if it
ever goes down.  Huge walls of blinkenlights, 30-foot-thick blast doors,
"We could tell you, sir, but then we'd have to kill you", the whole weird trip.
Cornpone accents with their fingers on the pulse of the Apocalypse.

   Oh, *man*, I said to myself.  I have to talk to this woman.  I haven't
forgotten the nationwide media flap after _War_Games_ came out.  You remember,
that silly movie where the kid with the voice-controlled IMSAI (snort) cracks
into NORAD's computers and accidentally damn near starts a nuclear war?  God
damn; I'll bet the plot of that sucker is seared into the collective psyche of
every security officer at Cheyenne Mountain, they probably screen the video
every couple months just to keep the newbies on their toes.

   What kind of hideous Federal heat could land on me if PAMELA D MILLER has
hacker/cracker confusion on the brain?  I imagine some steel-eyed amazon in a
blue suit exuding grim determination to Nip This Menace In The Bud.  *Bad*
scene for a guy who is, after all, better known in some circles for practising
witchcraft and stone anarchist-loony politics than for The Book.  Yiiiii ...
visions of sinister limos and Men In Black pulling up to my front porch.  "We
want to ask you a few questions, sir."  So I called my editor Terri and Guy
Steele (credited coauthor) and told them all the proceedings so far.  Nervous
laughter all around.  Lugubrious jokes.

   I need to convince this woman and her unknown masters that I'm a *harmless*
lunatic.  Time to track PAMELA D to her lair. (Yes.  Think of her that way,
Pamela D., like one of those impossible anonymous synthetic blondes in an
upscale skin magazine.  "Well, I'm into sailing Sunfishes and I really like
kids, you know?".  Good.  A *much* less threatening mental tableau.)  I limber
up my phoning fingers and call the number blazoned above her address.

   &lt;click&gt; &lt;sputter&gt; "NORAD operator ten.  What extension?"
   Gulp.  "Uh, I'm trying to reach Pamela D. Miller?  I got a product
information query from her."
   "Do you have an extension, sir?"
   "Um, no I don't.  Just this number.  And her address." I reel it off.
   "Try the base locator at Peterson, sir.  554-4020."
   "Thanks", I said, and hung up."

   Ohhh-kay.  NORAD for sure.  Hail Eris! PAMELA D's hanging out somewhere
under a couple of cubic miles of rock, likely in some cramped little office
with 1950s-era furniture and walls painted institutional puke-green.  And an
old-style black phone. (How long has it been since you've seen a black phone?)
(Trust me, this is what the military version of bureaucratic rabbit warrens
looks like.)  Or maybe at some gleaming console watching telemetry from all
those KH-11s we're supposed to pretend don't exist.  Hah.  Heads up, Pammy;
constructive chaos is about to enter your life.  All hail Discordia!

   This is about where things started to get really Kafkaesque.  The base
locator is their directory information desk.  I ask for Pamela D. Miller's
extension and get 3247 (remember that number).  I call it.  Some guy who sounds
exactly like Andy Griffith answers: "&lt;something unintelligible&gt; Morrow", I
say I'm looking for Pamela D. Miller and he says "You want 3427".

   O.K.  I call 3427.  Busy signal.  Bummer.  The thrill of the hunt having
took hold, I feel rather frustrated.  I go off and do other things for fifteen
minutes or so --- polishing the draft rules for the Dream Machines Bake-Off.
I call again.  Busy signal.  Bummer again.

   Lunch, some code-bashing, and about six or seven cycles of this later I
begin to suspect evil things.  Either this woman spends more continuous time on
the phone than your average Hollywood lawyer or I've got a wrong number.  Or
she doesn't actually exist.  In your typical government agency she could have
died with the phoneset in her hand in 1974 and nobody'd have got around to
noticing it was off the hook yet.  On the other hand, *somebody* had to fill
out that product-bingo card.

   On my next try, when the operator says "Busy, sir." I explain that the
number's been continuously so for several hours, and this seems unlikely.
   "I'll check for an alternate.  &lt;pause&gt;  Try 3052."
   Right.  No one answers at 3052.  I hang up and answer some email.  I try
again.  No answer.  Again, fifteen minutes later.  No answer.  Oy vey.  Isn't
this where I got on?

   So I try 3247 (the *original* number) again.  Busy.  Foo.  I call the base
locator people again and explain that there appears to be some confusion in
the air.  Is it 3247 or 3427?  And what's with this 3052 jazz?

   "I have 3247 listed, sir.  I'll double-check.  &lt;pause&gt; It says 3427 on
her card."  Silence.

   "Well, which is it?" I say.

   "3427.  But it says 3247 on the roster."

   "Well", I say with enormous gentleness, "don't you think you ought to
consider *fixing* it?"

   The silence of blank incomprehension on the other end.  Never ask a droid
to exceed its programming; it wastes your time and annoys the droid.

   I hang up.  And try 3427 again.  Busy...

   A few cycles later I conclude this isn't working; it's time to drop back
and punt.  I consider everything I know about bureaucracies, call the locator
people and confidently ask for the US Space Command main administration number.

   "Um, there doesn't seem to be one, sir.  Oh, wait, you can try this one."
She gives out with a string of numbers.
   "Can you transfer me?"
   "Stand by."  (...only in the military)
   &lt;click&gt;
   "AF Space Command."
   I go into my spiel about PAMELA D. and her inquiry and her address.
   "Uh, that's a Cheyenne Mountain address. Can't help you with that."
   "Um", I said, "this *is* US Space Command?"
   "No sir, this is AF Space Command.  Separate organization.  We're on the
base; they're under the mountain."
   "Two *separate* Space Commands?" I said. "Why two?"
   I can't tell you what he said, because I didn't understand the resulting
freshet of bureaucratese.  A couple of requests for clarification just got
me in deeper.  I caught something about "functional separation" and strings
of building numbers about as intelligible as so many Egyptian hieroglyphs.
   Struggling my way out of this verbal morass, I said, "Well, where do
I go from here?"
   "Lemme see if I can send you over to someone that'll help", he says,
and gives me another number.

   It's mid-afternoon now and I'm starting to lose it.  Fifteen hundred miles
from these people and I feel as thoroughly trapped in their maze as though I
was physically under that bloody mountain.  Theseus with no Ariadne and a
nuclear-security Minotaur lurking around the next bend.  (I like my mixed
metaphors shaken, not stirred, thank you.)  PAMELA D, where are you?

   But I call this guy's number and get the most human-sounding voice yet.
"Base information", it says.  Young, female, black, rather pretty if that lilt
isn't out of sync with her looks.  Quite a change from the depersonalized
midwestern/southern whitebread twangs I've been hearing.  She listens
sympathetically as I recount my tale of woe.

   "Well, let's see what I can do for you."  &lt;pause&gt;  "That's strange.
I have no listing for a Pamela Miller."
   If there were any justice in the world there'd have been eerie, sinister
music on the soundtrack just then.  Slowly building towards the Moment of
Discovery.  Wait for it.  At the time, a slight but definite premonitory
chill ran down my spine.
   "Well.  Does this mail code mean anything to you?  J2C/SSO-C?"
   "Yes sir, it means she's in J2 section."
   "O.K., what does J2 do?  What does that say about her job?"
    Long pause. "She's in intel, sir."

   Jangling chords and screaming brass from the unseen orchestra.  Oh, *great*.
All the paranoid fantasies that'd been slowly graying out as I threaded my way
through the labyrinth sprang back to full and colorful life.  The
*intelligence* group.  Better and better.  I thought about buzzing Guy and
asking him if he was on good terms with any of his overseas relatives.

   "A spook!" I said, and laughed rather hollowly.  "No wonder I've had trouble
reaching her.  What do I try next?"
   Perhaps ominously, the woman did not elect to contradict my choice of
terms.  "I'll see if I can reach anyone at J2 who knows her", she said.  Long
pause.  Long, long pause.  Background noises; people coughing, murmured
speech, file doors banging.
   Finally, anticlimax.  "I found her. That's 2nd Lt. Miller, sir; I don't know
why she'd have "CHIEF" after her name.  Her extension is 3433, but she's on
detached duty and won't be back till Monday."

   And there you have it.  It's 2:39 the following morning and I look like
an out-take from the "Nightfly" cover --- but if I disappear mysteriously,
y'all will *know* where to start.

                        TO BE CONTINUED...

(Interlude, Friday morning.  My father reads an uploaded version of the above
and asks if I intend to post it.  Upon learning that I already have, he soberly
advises against offending the entire U.S. Air Force.  "After all," he observes,
"they could drop a smart bomb down your chimney."  Gee.  Thanks, Dad.)

Monday morning, March 30th: Once more into the breach --- and Pamela D. Miller
is real!  Got her first time.  Neither amazon nor bimbo, of course, but a
bright and generous-minded lady with a sense of humor.  And a *1st* lieutenant
now.  She turns out to be (no less) chief of computer security at NORAD; and
(mirabile dictu) she *knows* the difference between a hacker and a cracker.
*Vast* sigh of relief --- no snatch teams in my future and I can unstop my
chimney now.

She was hip enough to laugh when I told her something of my travails last
Wednesday, laugh harder when I told her the title of this posting, and
hardest when I volunteered to autograph her copy of TNHD with an inscription
reading "I will not start World War III.  I will not start World War III.
I will not start World War III...."

She's not allowed to have a direct phone line, much less an Internet address
(think about it) so this mini-epic is going to have to go to her by snail-mail.
But I've been invited to tour NORAD and (yes, it is possible) visit the War
Room if I'm ever out Colorado way...

                                ---

RISKS moral.  Gotta have a RISKS moral for this story.  Well, there are a
couple.  The trivial one is, watch out for aliasing problems if you ever edit a
book; we've only got one word for several different kinds of `editor', and that
high-level difference may not be visible to computers or the clerical help.

A less trivial one is "Don't be paranoid; it encourages paranoia in others.".
I had fun writing the above; I've always enjoyed the mad-genius-on-speed style
as practised by Robert Anton Wilson, Tom Robbins, Hunter Thompson at. al. ---
but if Lt. Miller were that wiggy or I'd really approached her with The Fear
dripping from my every vocal overtone, things could've got ugly (hah! little
did she suspect that I kept her on the phone only long enough for my insidious
infrasonic acoustic virus to escape from her earpiece and set up *sinister
resonances* in any nearby electronic equipment...)

The least trivial of all is that *human* networking is still our most effective
tool for some important kinds of risk reduction.  Mutual trust, when you can
establish it, is the best security.  You guess; am I more or less worried now
about the risks inherent in having something like NORAD exist, having got
a little acquainted with Lt. Miller?  Are *you* more or less worried after
reading this story?  And, which is the real point, does this posting make it
more or *less* likely that someone with the requisite skills would actually
try to crack NORAD?

        Today's epigraph courtesy Matthew "Girlfriend" Sweet.  The song is
        called "Superdeformed".  I love this guy.  Guitar player, singer,
        songwriter, bandleader.  The band plays the song in the studio and
        that's the record.  You can even hear the amps humming before they
        start playing.  Nice album from a nice guy.  I may do a review
        later.
