What is it with you people? Don't they feed you at home? The leitmotif of
this issue is food, glorious food, and I must say, wait til lunchtime to
read this one, or you might start chewing on the keyboard.

To start off with, let me report that Sunday night, I dined (no other
word, really) with Our Founder, the eminent Tom Parmenter himself, at
the home of genial and popular Desperado BOOKIE::SCHORR. Tom had kind
words about the way posterity was treating his heritage, but
complained mildly of a lack of trip reports. I told him you were all
staying home counting your stock options, but he demanded instant
gratification.

So here is a trip report from me! I've just come back from three weeks'
vacation, the last two weeks of which were spent in a stupor on a porch
in Maine, reading Marcel Proust and eating lobster. But the first week!
Mon Dieu! Marcus Aurelius and I went to Montreal and ate ourselves silly.
There are delightful things to do in Montreal, museums, galleries,
wonderful shopping, great walks and handsome parks. We did them all, but
they paled in comparison to the food. Let me outline a few meals, and then
it's on with the revels.

The breakfast facilities at our hotel were acceptable for a hotel, but
the first rule of life (actually the second rule, the first rule is "A
woman with a black dress in the closet and a ham in the cooler is
ready for anything.") is "Never eat at the hotel." We often ate
breakfast at a little boulangerie around the corner. And oh boy, what
wonderful breakfasts! I'd wake up in the middle of the night and think
"A baguette and Brie tomorrow" or "Can I get away with a tartelette
aux prunes?" I am not an egg person, but hand me a baguette and some
smoked salmon, and you've made my day.

We really got lucky when it came to lunch. One day, we went to the
boulangerie and got a couple of sandwiches, some wonderful green bean
salad with hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, tiny little chopped
cornichons, and red bell peppers, YUM, and a tartelette aux prunes,
and then went somewhere and bought eau minerale and Orangina. (More
sophisticated souls would have bought a demi of red wine, but we're
simple folk.) We went to the beautiful Mount
Royal Park in the center of the city, wandered around the beautiful
paths designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, and had a pique-nique.

Another day we went to a Russian restaurant I'll tell you about in a
minute. It wasn't open for lunch, so we settled for the Japanese
restaurant next door. It was terrific! We had lots of sushi, perfectly
fresh, of course, and beautifully presented. The miso soup was the
best I've had, it had tasty seaweed in it! The sunomono salad had a
big shrimp artistically desposed on top of the shreds of cucumber.
Dessert was a perfectly ripe orange, sliced and peeled,
and arranged beautifully, with a fin of that veined green paper that
figures so prominently in Japanese decorations. Even the toothpicks
were carved and decorated!

Next day, we were back in that neighborhood dying of starvation, and decided
to try the next restaurant on the block -- Vent Vert, a little nouvelle
cuisine bistro. Wonderful lunch -- nicely tasty steak for me, with a
wonderful salad of Belgian endives. Marcus Aurelius had a delicious pasta
primavera, and dessert was the most melting little pudding decorated with
jujubes!

Here's a map...

Ok, now where were we...oh yes. Well, we've eaten at Sushi 'R' Us,
and at Vent Vert, and now it's Wedensday night, and we're ready for a
little balalaika. Troika is small, dark, crowded, and serves
wonderful, wonderful food. We started with sturgeon and pelmeni,
little Siberian Peking ravioli. The implications of pelmeni on
Sino-Soviet hegemony are for another pen, but they are delicious
little meat-stuffed pasta turnovers.

About the time we were scarfing down the hors d'oeuvres, a couple in
their early 70s arrived at the next table, which is to say
practically in our laps. These folks were...well, "portly" is
charitable, but they certainly seemed cheerful enough. Their manner
to each other was courtly and charming, and I thought, "Ah, the
kindness of longtime companions and spouses, isn't it great!" They
inquired severely about the serving of the vodka, and were assured
that the glasses were kept in the freezer, and so was the vodka. The
vodka is apparently an authentic Russian vodka which is not available
in the US. I think the name is Moskvaya, but I could be wrong.

The strolling guitar player had been regaling us with renditions of
every Russian standard you've ever heard, like Kolyinka, Ochi Chornya,
and the Vulgar Boatmen's Song. And all molto con vibrato, 1915
vintage! He came to their table, and asked if there were anything they
wanted to hear. Mrs. Courtly tried to recall the name of a song, which
we were able to supply, and the four of  us started to chat. (This
is standard operating procedure in Montreal -- everywhere we went,
couples at adjoining tables would chat, and enjoy the evening
together.) Turns out they're not old married people at all! They were
in Montreal celebrating their second wedding anniversary.

I ordered duck, and I've seldom had a better. Perfectly roasted,
crisp, not too fat, tender as dreams of childhood, and accompanied by
fresh figs braised in Tokay. I think the duck must have been roasted on
a rack to achieve both tenderness and not-fatitude. That's certainly
the way Marcus Aurelius gets his ducks lined up.

Mr. Courtly had ordered Steak Tartare, and while a Cossack did not
ride up and fling a steak on his table, Mrs. Troika did wheel up a
trolley and start elaborate preparation. Mr. Courtly was shown a
platter of raw, chopped steak, which he tasted and pronounced acceptable.
Mrs. Troika then mixed egg with a little vinegar, and then started
pouring in oil drop by drop, whipping furiously the while. Lots of
salt and pepper, and then the meat was carefully and tenderly folded
in. He was given it to taste, and asked for certain recondite
adjustments. Back in the bowl, more careful ministrations, and he
finally accepted it. Kind of like acceptance test, actually. And of
course, since we had all enjoyed the spectacle, he gave us bites! It
was incredibly rich, wonderful flavor, and I think a
single bite must have been my limit. You could feel your arteries
congealing even as you chewed.

At this point, the strolling singer came to our table. "What would
you like to hear?" he asked in a heavy Russian accent. "Oh, we've
been enjoying everything you've sung, please just sing us a Russian
song you like." "I know over 350 Russian songs," he insisted proudly. "What
would you like to hear?" "How about number 27?" I said wildly. And
with no further ado he launched into number 27! It was delightful --

Now, two years ago, I had dinner at the Chantecler in Nice, a
three-star French restaurant. It was the best meal I have ever eaten
in my long and well-fed life, but our last night in Montreal, we ate
at Le Fadeau. It gave Chantecler a run for its money. Even now I can
barely contemplate the dinner without bursting into tears, but let me
just outline the contents and you can decide for yourselves. One quick
word of explanation: we ordered the 'menu degustation', which is 8 courses
of whatever the chef feels most like cooking. You place yourselves entirely
in his hands, and you don't even know what you're going to eat until
it arrives at your table and the waiter announces it in sonorous tones.
Here's the menu degustation for August 20, 1987:

   o  First course:  shrimp mousse with sweetbreads, served with
                     sweet red bell pepper sauce
   o  Second course: cold consomme with sorrel sauce
   o  Third course:  braised swordfish, decorated with green pepper,
                     served with green peppercorn sauce
   o  Sorbet:        intense, intense citrus sorbet, grapefruit and
                     lime, I think, served with dry vermouth
   o  Fourth course: sausage of slivers of breast of capon, in a
                     matrix of quail mousse, served with morel sauce
   o  Fifth course:  noisettes of lamb wrapped in grape leaves,
                     wrapped in filo pastry, served with legumes assortis,
                     including the world's tiniest broiled tomato provencale
   o  Sixth course:  salad of watercress, dressed with raspberry
                     vinegar and walnut oil, and decorated with slices of
                     almonds
   o  Seventh course:striped mousse of blackcurrants (good for the
                     liver, according to the waiter) and blueberries,
                     served with a blackcurrant sauce
   o  Eighth course: a perfect, roast nectarine, decorated with thin
                     slices of strawberries and served with peach
                     brandy sloshed over it.

And lest you think that the two of us must have expired on the spot,
and that I am writing this to you through the agency of  a medium, let
me tell you that these courses were served over the period of three
hours, and were small portions. When food is this intensely the
essence of itself, you do well to go slow. Nothing could have tasted
more shrimply than the first course, nor more of lamb than the fifth.
The service was elegant, and I assure you that nobody pranced up to
us and announced in a loud voice "Hi! My name is Alphonse and I'm your
waitperson for the evening!" There is something about being addressed
as "Madame" that gilds the most glittering evening. Deference! That's
the ticket!

And we now return you to our regularly scheduled issue, which is
already in progress!

  Lunch, the Hewlett-Packard Way

        by Stephen Harrison and Noel Magee

  This is the story of a different kind. No melting CPUs, no screaming
  disc drives, just the kind of psychological torture that scars a man
  for life.

  I had a 9:00 meeting with my Sales Rep. I needed to buy an entire new
  Series 70, the works. He said it'd take about an hour. Three hours
  later, we'd barely got the datacomm hardware down on paper, so he
  invited me downstairs to lunch.

  This was my first experience in an HP cafeteria. Above the service
  counter was a menu which began...

  MMU's (Main Meal Units)

  00010A  Burger. Includes sesame-seed bun.
          Must order condiments 00110A separately.

    001   Deletes seeds.
    002   Expands burger to two patties.

  00020A  Double Cheeseburger, Preconfigured. Includes cheese, bun
          and condiments.

    001   Add-on bacon.
    002   Delete second patty.
    003   Replaces second patty with extra cheese.

  00021A  Burger Upgrade to Double Cheeseburger.

    001   From Single Burger.
    002   From Double Burger.
    003   Return credit for bun.

  00220A  Burger Bundle. Includes 00010A, 00210A and 00310A

    001   Substitute root beer 00311A for cola 00310A.

  My eyes glazed over. I asked for a burger and a root beer.
  The waitress looked at me like I was an alien.

  "How would you like to order that, sir?"

  "Quickly, if possible. Can't I just order a sandwich and a drink?"

  "No sir. All our service here is menu driven. Now what would you like?"

  I scanned the menu. "How big is the 00010 burger?"

  "The patty is rated at eight bites."

  "Well, how about the rest of it?"

  "I don't have the specs on that, sir, but I think it's a bit more."

  "Eight bites is too small. Give me the Double Burger Upgrade."

  My sales rep interrupted. "No, you want the Single Burger option 002
  'expands burger to two patties'. The Double Burger Upgrade would give
  you two burgers.

  "But you could get return credit on the extra bun," the waitress
  chimed in, trying to be helpful, "although it isn't documented."

  I looked around to see if anybody was staring at me. There was a couple
  in line behind us. I recognized one of them, a guy who nearly mowed me
  down in the parking lot with his cherry-red '62 Vette. He was talking
  to some woman who was waving her arms around and looking very excited.

  "What if... we marketed the bacon cheeseburger with the vegetable option
  and without the burger and cheese? It'd be a BLT!"

  The woman charged off in the direction of the telephone, running
  steeplechase over tables and chairs. My waitress tried to get my
  attention again. "Have you decided, sir?"

  "Yeah, give me the double burger- excuse me, I mean the 00020A with
  option 001. I want everything on it." She put me down for the
  Condiment Expansion Kit, which included mayonnaise, mustard and pickles
  with a option to substitute relish.

  "Ketchup." I hated to ask. "I want ketchup on that, too."

  "That's not a condiment, sir, it's a Tomato Product." My Sales Rep
  butted in again. "That's not a supported configuration."

  "What now?" I kept my voice steady.

  "Too juicy. The bun can't handle it."

  "Look, forget the ketchup, just put some lettuce and tomatoes on it."

  The waitress backed away from the counter. "I'm sorry, sir, but that's
  not supported either. The bun can take it, but the burger won't fit
  in the box. "Ah, but it will." The Sales Rep defended himself. "Just
  not at first release." "It is being beta-tested, sir."

  I checked the overhead screen. Fries, number 00210A, option 110,
  French, followed by option 120, English. "What the hell are English
  Fries?" I turned to the Sales Rep. "Chips they call them. We sell a
  lot of them."

  I gave up. "OK, OK, just give me a plain, vanilla Burger Bundle."

  This confused the waitress profoundly. "Sir, Vanilla as an option is
  configured only for Series 00450 Milkshakes." My sales rep chuckled.
  "No, ma'am, he just wants a standard 00220A off the shelf. I wondered
  how long it had been on the shelf. I didn't ask.

  "Very good, sir." The waitress breathed a sigh of relief. "Your meal
  is now on order. Now, how would you like it supported?"

  "Support?"

  She directed me to the green shaded area at the bottom of the menu,
  and I began a litany with my Sales Rep that I'll never forget.

  "Implementation assistance?"

  "You get a waiter."

  "Implementation analysis?"

  "You tell him how hungry you are, and he tells you what to eat."

  "Response Center Support?"

  "He brings it to your table."

  "Extended materials?"

  "You get refills."

  I stuffed some money at the waitress and told her to take it. She
  gave me my check on three sheets of green-bar paper. I studied it
  on the way to my table, and decided it'd pass as an emergency napkin.

  Table? My Sales Rep had been bright enough to order us a table. He
  hadn't been bright enough to check on a delivery date. The table
  waiter slouching in the corner surveyed the crowded room, looked at me
  and said "Two weeks. But I can get you a standalone chair by the
  window right away."

  I handed him the tray. A woman rushed up to me with two cups of chili
  and sauerkraut for the hot dog someone else had ordered. The room
  began to grow dim, my eyesight faded...

  I woke up clutching the water-glass at my bedside table. It was five
  AM, four hours till my meeting with HP. I had had a vision, I did
  what it told me to do. I dialed my office, and I called in sick.

Subj:   A folk tale for Desperado

This story was told by Doc Watson on A Prairie Home Companion and
transcribed by my father.

        Awhile back I met up with an  old  boy  I  hadn't  played
     music with for a long old time, so he invited me down to his
     house to spend the night.  Decided we'd pick some.
        Sat around the fireplace and picked a little while, while
     the  little lady got supper.  Now I know most of you here in
     the audience tonight have at least two favorite  foods  when
     you  are  real  starved, I mean real hungry, that you like a
     little better than anything else.  Well, two of  mine  would
     be corn bread and navy or pinto beans cooked with a big slab
     of pork shoulder or ham.  Don't you know that's  good!   She
     called  us  on to that table and we got down in there.  That
     was two of the main good dishes she had on the table  and  I
     was  ashamed  to  eat more than a fourth of what I wanted of
     that because I tried to use what  little  table  manners  my
     mama had learnt me, you know, over the years.
        After supper we went back to  the  fireplace  and  picked
     away  down  to the shank of the evening and he stopped right
     in the middle of a good tune and said "Gosh almighty, Doc, I
     got to go to bed, I got to work tomorrow."
        And I said, "I noticed when you  showed  me  around  this
     pretty  living room with all this nice hardwood paneling and
     everything on this pretty log house you built that there  is
     just  one  great big old king-size bed way back there in the
     corner.  If you will hand me three or four of those homemade
     quilts,  I'll  sleep  right  here in front of this good warm
     fireplace just like a pig in a bed of leaves."
        He says, "Well, Doc, I can do that and give  you  a  good
     pillow  too  if  you want to do that, but why don't you just
     sleep in front of us back there.  That big old king-size bed
     is so wide we'll never know you're there."
        And I said, "Well, son, I ain't  used  to  that  kind  of
     thing but I guess I could."
        We lay there about ready to go to sleep when  his  little
     hounds  took  every  splinter  off  that  back  porch  after
     something that growled next to his pig lot.  He  jumped  out
     of  there  into them boots and britches and grabbed that old
     shotgun and I heard him click that thing down to see  if  it
     was  loaded  as he went out the door, and he said, "I'll get
     him this time.  That bear is going to get my little pigs  if
     I don't shoot him and kill him."
        When he went out of hearing all the way  up  through  the
     woods,  she  leaned over and said, "Now's your chance if you
     want; waste no time!"
        Well I'll tell you all the good truth, by the time he got
     back  I  had ate up all them beans and the rest of that corn
     bread.

Subj:   cooking in the dishwasher.....

I thought my wife would be amused by the "cooking fish in the dishwasher"
story, so I printed out the last issue of Desperado and took it home to
show her.  She reads it, and says, "I've got a recipe for that!"  You're
kidding, I say.  So, she gets out the book and shows it to me.  Here it
is, for the edification of all:

The cookbook is "More Make It Now -- Bake It Later", by Barbara Goodfellow.
(Grosset &amp; Dunlap, Inc., New York, N.Y. 10010, 1979, ISBN 0-448-16857-X)

This is copied exactly from page 19:

        "You try this one -- I'm scared to!

        "Wrap whole, cleaned fish securely in foil.

        "Put fish in your dishwasher -- no soap, please!

        "Run dishwasher through its full cycle.

        "They say your fish will be perfectly cooked!

        "A good friend tells me this reminds her of the old
        one about cooking your pot roast tied to the manifold
        bewteen SF and Tahoe!"

Subj:   Poached fish spoiler ...

My wife read an article in Yankee magazine on poaching fish in the
dishwasher, and then read a comment on the technique in the appliance
repair section of Family Handyman, of all places.  The editor warned
that dishwashers fall about 20 degrees short of the 165 degree
minimum needed to cook food safely, according to the Dept of
Agriculture, and that if you're not a fanatic about cleaning the
dishwasher there's a possibility of contamination by detergent and
bacteria residue.

He also said that some people are doing poultry in the dishwasher.
If it's true that half of commercial chicken is contaminated by
salmonella to some degree, this seems like a truly daring practice.

(Heard on "All Things Considered" the other night)

 Two detectives were attempting to extract a confession from a particularly
recalcitrant suspect. They told the suspect that he was to be given a lie
detector test. One of the detectives placed a metal colander on the suspect's
head; this colander had two wires running from it to the back of the squad-room
Xerox machine.

 On the copy surface of the Xerox machine was a piece of paper with the
phrase "HE'S LYING" typed on it.

 Every time the suspect answered a question, the detective would press the
&lt;COPY&gt; button on the machine; lights would flash, the machine would whirr
and out would pop a sheet of paper saying "He's Lying"!

 The suspect eventually became so rattled that he told the truth!

ps: as a footnote, the confession was later thrown out in court; the judge
didn't see the humor in it!

Every summer there is a Beethoven Festival in San Francisco and a guest
conductor conducts the San Francisco Symphony.

Once upon a time there was a guest conductor at the Beethoven Festival in San
Francisco.  The conductor's life was based around Beethoven. He adored
Beethoven's art and was famous for directing Beethoven all around the world.
During the rehearsals of the 7th symphony, one of the second violinists was
off key.  The conductor noticed this and said: "STOP! STOP!, the violinist at
the back row of the second violins, YOU are playing in the wrong key!" The
violinist insisted that he was playing correctly.  The conductor and the
violinist entered in a heated discussion for ten minutes, and at the end of
the discussion the conductor was upset and was seen rushing to his belongings
at the back of the stage mumbling "This is a crime, he is murdering
Beethoven's art."

A few minutes later the conductor emerged with a gun in his hands, went to the
violinist playing off-key, and yelled: "You killed Beethoven's art, I will now
kill you!" and he killed the violinist. The public was outraged and the
conductor was sentenced to death as a result of a short trial.  (In his
defense all he said was "The violinist was murdering Beethoven's art....")

The conductor was to be executed at San Quentin, a nearby high security
prison.  During the morning of the execution, the District Attorney's rep.,
the City Coroner, and two guards were present next to the electric chair. The
guards tied the poor man down and threw down the switch.   Amazingly, the
orchestra conductor was smiling and talking from his electric chair. The guard
panicked and subjected him to all the electric power they had.  AMAZINGLY
ENOUGH, NOTHING HAPPENED and he was still smiling and humming tunes from
Beethoven's Missa Solemna.

The City Coroner was shocked. He went to the smiling man who was strapped to
the electric chair and asked, "How come we cannot kill you?" The answer was:
"I AM A VERY GOOD CONDUCTOR!"

BTW, I do enjoy all the musical references which you put into Desperado,
particularly the gossip.  I like it because it brings back memories,
not only of performances (e. g., when you talked about Levine it reminded me
of his Ravinia debut:  I went to see Ormandy conduct Mahler's 2nd on Opening
Night.  He cancelled, they got Klemperer, he cancelled, they got this kid
named Levine who no one ever heard of.  He walked in and conducted a pretty
good 2nd from *memory*!  That's quite formidable, especially since Chicago has
a reputation of being unmerciful towards anybody they don't respect)...
but of sitting around in music school, trading war stories.

Back in another incarnation I studied composition for a while.  Then I quit
to make my fortune as a rock'n'roller, then I got a job as a COBOL programmer,
eventually leading to DEC.  Presently, I play trumpet in the Digital Big Band,
and I sporadically try to teach my 7-year-old daughter how to play piano with
more than 2 fingers.

Keep up the good work.  Maybe I'll see you from the orchestra pit somewhere.

I myself am hanging around impatiently waiting for the autumn season to open.
And considering that the summer season of concerts just ended August 29, you
can see that I am not a patient woman! Having run out of Mozart operas to
conduct in concert, James Bolle of Monadnock Music started giving us Rossini,
starting with La Cenerentola, which you may possibly have seen on TV a few
years ago with the enchanting Frederica von Stade as Cenerentola (Cinderella
in Italian.) Wonderful performance, with D'Anna Fortunato in the title role,
but even while my ear was being ravished by fioriture, I was thinking to
myself, "Hmm! Turco in Italia, L'Italiana in Algieri, Barbiere..." You'd have
to go some to run out of Rossini!

And if what you like is gossip, here's some: we heard Mozart's
Abduction From the Seraglio two weeks before the Rossini. Good cast,
especially the tenor who sang Pedrillo, the hero's servant. Good cast
with one exception, however -- the tenor who sang the hero was in way
over his head and just couldn't manage the role of Belmonte. And what
happened next day? Bolle called the Pedrillo and said "How fast can
you learn the lead tenor in Cenerentola?" Two weeks later Pedrillo
appeared as Ramiro, and a good time was had by all.

 [Now I wonder how they cleaned it up: did they do it in the approximately

area to 80°K?  Someone may have pointed out how fast the hydrogen would
evaporate and also that it would rise in the air faster than you could contain
it; but a bureaucrat and the press homed in on "dangerously inflammable"
and therefore undoubtedly ordered the cleanup.]

                                 ---
By JOE BERGER
In the most spectacular case of human spontaneous combustion ever
reported, a man sunbathing in 90-degree heat suddenly burst into
flames -- incinerating him and scorching his bride who was lying by
his side.

....

``We were having the best honeymoon in the world,'' grieving [Bride]
Pia [Pehrson] told police.

``Every day we went swimming and played in the sand. That afternoon we
were just lying on our blankets, laughing and holding hands. All at
once I heard a strange hissing noise and [Groom] Sven got a wild look
in his eyes and I knew that something was terribly wrong.

``Then there was a loud *WHOOF* and he was totally engulfed by fire.

``It was horrifying. One second he was smiling and talking to me and
the next second he was gone. I knew I was being burned on my arms and
neck but I was too shocked to care. I can still see Sven's eyes
staring right at me, pleading, through the flames.''

....

Astonished scientists hope the incredible case will help them
determine why certain people suddenly burst into flames for no
apparent reason.

But one police official on Majorca is convinced that there is no
mystery to investigate.

``There were clouds in the sky that day, and lightning was reported
over the water,'' said lawman Luis Bara. ``The man was simply struck
by lightning. It happens to people all the time.''

I just picked up a copy of Weekly World News my own self -- it bore the
headline "WOMAN TURNS INTO CAT!" subhead "After eating cat food for 20
years." There was a a picture, too, and she certainly did suggest the feline.
Caption on picture was "She purrs, growls and hisses." Sound like anybody
you know?

Subj:   Them pointy-faced Siamese cats

Eugh!  I suppose they please some people, with their sleek, long and narrow
faces, but for my money they're a total washout. (It is true that my money, as
sparse as is is, has little effect on the cat breeders of the world.)

I have seen and handled some of these new-wave Siamese cats, and they're just
plain *dumb*.  When you reinforce one genetic trait, you may alter others as
well, and the cats' mental capacity lost out.  Just look at the size of that
tiny cranial cavity!  :-)  Not only are they stupid, but they are also lacking
in the demandingly pushy need for human companionship that was bred into the
line initially.

What I like is a good-fashioned applehead.  That's what the breeders call a
Siamese with a head that is broader and somewhat rounder than the fashionable
style.  I have three appleheads who have condescended to live in my house, and
they are wonderfully affectionate and clever cats.  Anyone who says Siamese
are nasty-tempered hasn't seen cats who have had the love they crave.
