Subj:   i've been urged, by a desperado subscriber, to send the following
        article for possible inclusion in a desperado issue.

(from N.Y. Times 3/11/87 edition written by David E. Sanger)

                   Big Blue vs. the Bulgarian Megabite

   The U.S. &amp; the Soviet bloc play a cat-&amp;-mouse game with computer technology.
The Government tries to insure that nothing more powerful than an Apple II slips
through to Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the other side is eager to demonstrate
that it already understands the technology, hoping to persuade the U.S. to relax
its export controls.
   According to a story making the rounds in Washington, American officials got
their hands on a Bulgarian-made 200-megabyte disk drive.
   "We didn't have the expertise to evaluate it, so we shipped the thing to a
large company we do a lot of business with," said one senior Government offic-
ial, warming to the story. The company, others volunteered, was I.B.M.
   For weeks, according to the tale, engineers tinkered and toyed, but even the
technological firepower of the world's largest computer company could not make
the Bulgarian disk drive go whir and click. Finally, the engineers did what any
frustrated customer would do: they called for service.
   "A few weeks later these two Bulgarians show up," eager to demonstrate the
capabilities of the machine, the Government official, who insisted on anonymity,
continued. "One of them is a woman, a rather large woman actually, who had very
few tools. But she started taking the drive apart, pulling out wires with her
bare hands."
   And as astonished technicians looked on, "she started stripping the wires
with her teeth," he said.
   By the end of the day the disk drive was up and humming. As the strong-
toothed Bulgarian packed up to go, the engineers presented her with a parting
gift: a pair of wire strippers.
   A spokesman for I.B.M. suggested yesterday that the episode may be apocry-
phal. But the Government official swore the story was true. By transferring
wire stripper technology, he said, the United States may have "put a lot of
Bulgarian dentists out of business."

Subj:   Submission of humor for Desperado by my friend who is
        unfortunate enough to be a non-Digit.

The following script parodying "AMERIKA" is by my friend Marc Kenig,
who is a computer scientist, teacher, and writer, as well as a neat-o
person and good guy.  He gave me his permission to send this to
Desperado.  In the original, the word "RUSCIA" came in nifty
red-white-and-blue Bic Bananacrayon, with an eagle perched on the
"CIA" part.  I have ommitted a couple of references which were
certainly funny but which might have provoked flap from the Corporate
Lack-of-Humor and Proper-Use-of-Notes Threatening Department.

The scene:  The camera pans across a parking lot in front of a
restaurant, winter, snow.  People line up in front of the restaurant
door, huddled against the cold.  Zoom back to take in full scene:  the
Golden Arches rising triumphantly among the onion-domed church
steeples of Moscow.  We see two young people waiting back in the line.
Close-up:

ALEXI:  I must fufill my quota of Egg McMuffins or else I will be sent
back to Reorientation Training Mall.

SVETLANA:  It is your own stupid fault, Alexi Boredonovich!  No good
can come of studying mortgage tables all night.  I am very pained to
see you cooperate...(she breaks down into tears).

ALEXI:  Shh! (quietly) shh...My sweet babushka, if you cry your
mascara will run.  You know being seen without makeup or with
imperfect face is a capitalist offense.  Worse than no stockings or
earrings.  You must learn to try to put up with bourgeoise trappings,
lest the C.I.A. see you!

SVETLANA:  I will try to be more like Nancy Reagan for you, Alexi.  I
go back to the Cadillac and fix my face...

ALEXI:  Wait, you go without Russian Express card!...

SCENE II

The home (split-level ranch) of the Guervich Family.  Little Anya is
seen writing.  Mother is defrosting dinner in the microwave.

MOTHER:  Anya, dear, what are you doing?  Why don't I hear any
rock-and-roll coming from your room?

ANYA:  Oh Mama, I have to concentrate on my application to "The Las
Vegas Showgirl School for Drug-taking and Prostitution."  I want to
get a good job and become a millionaire, or even the next Vanna White!

(Papa Guervich comes in)

PAPA:  Damn minority underclass, I told him to fix the automatic
garage door opener!  How can I face my Lodge Brothers with a broken
automatic garage door opener?

MOTHER:  Hire a psychotic killer to hang him from the garage door
brass eagle!

PAPA:  You watch too much TV from America!

MOTHER:  And where have you been so long?  Out drinking martinis or
chasing young prostitutes?

PAPA:  Neither.  I have been to vote.  So many candidates, it keeps me
from my family.  Anya!  Turn up that rock-and-roll music right this
minute, you hear me?

ANYA:  No Papa, I defy you and I hate you!

PAPA:  Good girl, she will do well in America.

Memo to an Author
-----------------

It is a rare pleasure for an editor to receive a manuscript in which
thoughts are expressed with the scintillating clarity of a skillful
(sic) cut gem, where ideas are organized with logical precision and
words selected convey exact meaning with elegance and grace.  When in
addition such lucid writing is combined with neatness, legibility, and
care in preparation of the copy, we are overjoyed.  However, that drivel
that you sent us is no damn good.

ABACUS, vol. 4, no. 3, Spring 1987 contains the results of ABACUS
Competition #3, which invited readers to submit actual examples or
parodies of software disclaimers of warranty.

The winner is included as a format example in the user manual of the
Horstmann Software Design product, ChiWriter:

  Cosmotronic Software Unlimited Inc. does not warrant that the functions
  contained in the program will meet your requirements or that the
  operation of the program will be uninterrupted or error-free.

EasyFlow:

  We don't claim Interactive EasyFlow is good for anything--if you think
  it is, great, but it's up to you to decide. If Interactive EasyFlow
  doesn't work: tough. If you lose a million because Interactive EasyFlow
  messes up, it's you that's out the million, not us. If you don't like
  this disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do the absolute minimum
  provided by law, up to and including nothing.

  This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software
  packages, but ours is in plain English and theirs is in legalese.

  We didn't really want to include any disclaimer at all, but our lawyers
  insisted. We tried to ignore them but they threatened us with the attack
  shark at which point we relented.

These remind me of the software order form I received some years ago
requiring me to sign a statement acknowledging that the only warranty made
by DJ AI Systems was that they owned the copyright on the software being

Note 572.8                   Anti-shoplifting Device                      8 of 8

                               -&lt; Green strips &gt;-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fresh from Cornell, I remember the five-inch green magnetic strips
    that were the bane of many careless students.

    A friend of mine worked in one of the libraries, and as new books
    or magazines came in he would insert these adhesive strips into
    them.  Worked great.

    Now if I may wander from this discussion a bit...

    My friend and another guy were in a heated practical joke war.
    My friend, Steve, was a wiz at finesse.  The other fellow, Jack,
    was a wiz at...well...sledgehammer humor.  Overkill.  It was often
    just as hilarious, but a different style.  So one day Steve nails
    Jack nicely.  Jack retaliates with the old stand-by: a garbage pail of
    water propped against the door. (Consider it the anti-neutron bomb
    of the practical joke war -- it levels the house but leaves the
    people standing.)  So first thing in the morning, whoosh, Steve
    and I have very wet feet.  Yeah, we were roommates.

    So Steve, knowing Jack hates the smell of cigar smoke, buys a
    pack of the nastiest, cheapest ones he can find -- plus a short
    length of plastic tubing.  Jack has barricaded his room, you see.
    He expects sledgehammer humor in return, so he's thoroughly locked
    his room, and even stuffed a towel beneath the door to
    prevent...whatever.  Doesn't stop Steve.  Steve lights up his
    first White Owl (or Death Beak, I forget the brand), and puffs
    merrily through the plastic tube which pokes under Jack's door
    and past the towel.  Jack comes home later, steps inside, comes
    out thunderstruck.  When he figures out it was Steve he's delighted
    with Steve's ingenuity and goes off laughing to congratulate him.
    Steve -- just recovered from being nauseous in the bathroom from
    chain-smoking five Death Beaks -- graciously accepts the
    acknowledgment.

    But the fun's not over.

    Jack fires the next salvo.  Steve and I come home one day from classes,
    and everything in the room seems somehow...lighter.  Faded.
    Especially near the door.  Strange, yes.  I move the garbage can
    and notice it leaves a distinct SHADOW on the carpet.  Takes us
    two seconds to track down Jack and get a confession.  Yes, another
    old stand-by stunt: he took a hairdryer, held its nozzle under
    our door, fired it up, poured talcum powder into its intake and
    foooom.  Our room was deftly powdered.

    So...

    It's Steve's turn.  Steve works in a library, right?  Students study
    in libraries a lot, right?  In fact, pick any random student and
    say "he'll probably spend at least a minute in SOME library today"
    and you'll probably be right, right?  Steve works with, thus has
    unrestricted access to, thus could pilfer an armload of if
    the mood struck him, those little plastic security strips.

    Jack's an average student.  Goes to the library quite often.

    So one fine morning Steve slips into Jack's room when Jack is out
    and SATURATES Jack's belongings with pieces of little five-inch magnetic
    security strips.  Books, bookbag, jacket, pants, shoes, socks,
    newspaper, everything.  That day, I'm sure, Jack is such a magnetic
    anomoly that passing jet planes for miles around were zinging off course.

    Yup, Jack hits a library that day, his roommate with him.  They
    finish their business and his roommate steps through the security
    bar (a swinging bar that won't swing if you're trying to steal books),
    turns, and waits for Jack.  In a few moments, the roommate is on
    the ground in hysterics.  Jack had been nabbed and stopped.  Aghast,
    he starts pulling out books, all his own.  Still the bar won't swing.
    He sets down his bookbag entirely and tries to leave with empty hands.
    Whack, he hits the bar.  The security guy is leering at him now,
    The roommate has figured it out and is gasping on the
    ground outside.  So Jack empties his pockets.  Whack.  Jack takes off
    his jacket.  Whack.  He surely must have noticed the little
    green magnetic strips dropping from him like snowflakes, because
    his roommate reported later that Jack was cursing something like
    "I'll get you, Steve...no, I'll KILL you, Steve..."

    And that ended the war.  Finesse won out, and Jack rested his heavy
    head at Steve's feet.

    But to answer your question, no, I have no idea how they work.

As an old Cornellian one way and another, I warm to this recitation of a skill
which flourishes at Cornell as nowhere else. The most famous practical joker
of all time was a Cornellian named Hugh Troy, of whose many jokes my father
told me often and often. He filled in a pothole that everybody was used
to and slowed down for. My favorite involved an ice-covered lake, the
footprints of an elephant, a large hole broken in the ice, abstention from
use of lake water for at least six months, and the eventual discovery of a well-
weighted elephant's foot wastepaper basket. Cornelll was also the site of
jokes played on Louis Agassiz Fuertes, the great icthyologist, who once
explained why he never knew the names of his students: "Every time I learn the
name of a student, I forget the name of a fish." His students carefully
created a fantastic insect, using the thorax of one, the legs of another, the
antennae of a third, putting the whole together with jeweller's skill.
They eagerly showed this to Agassiz Fuertes, who looked through the microscope
at the creature, leaned back, polished his pince nez, and announced, "That,
gentlemen, is a humbug."

Subject: Computer-lighting board nearly causes WWIII

    With the recent discussion of computer-controlled lighting
boards, I ask "How resistant to Electron Magnetic Interference
should these boards be?"  Not such as academic point as one would
think.  An audio engineer friend of mine related this incident:

    He was running sound for the Broadway production of "A Chorus
Line" a few years back.  Then-president Ford came to a performance.
Secret Service men everywhere.  One by the sound board, one by lighting,
etc.  All is quiet until about the mid-point of the play.  Then the
Secret Service man standing by the lighting board (an early Nicholson
model I believe) got a call on his walkie-talkie.  To reply, he depressed
the push-to-talk switch, sending out a couple of watts of RF, and
Presto! the entire theatre was plunged into inky darkness.  Chaos
ensues, PERT guns are drawn, etc., etc.  It completely wiped out the
CMOS memory of the lighting board.

    Questions: should mil-spec EMI resistance be built into only military
equipment?  Who would have thought that a lowly theater lighting board would
be of critical national importance if for only a few moments?  Could a
high-tech John Wilkes Booth use some knowledge such as this for the next
assassination attempt?

                Helpful Hints from the Frugal Gourmet
                -------------------------------------

  o  Don't add water

        "That is not really such an exaggeration.  Recipes that tell you
        to add more water if needed, or 'simply add water,' would often
        be helped by the addition of wine or soup stock.  This is true of
        sauces, soups, stews, gravies, meat and fish dishes.  This is
        not true of waffles."

  o  Don't buy cooking wine

        "Cooking with wine and 'cooking wine' are two different things.
        Products labeled as cooking wine are wines of cheap quality and
        then loaded with salt so that the shipper may avoid the taxes
        placed on wine.  My rule is simple:  If you can't drink it,
        don't cook with it."

  o  Surviving the sommelier

        "When you have given the OK, the steward will open the bottle
        and present you with the cork.  What you do with the cork is your
        own business, but I cannot see any earthly reason for this odd
        business....If you sniff the cork you will smell cork -- I would
        prefer to sample the wine.  One expert advises placing the cork
        carefully in the ashtray in the hopes it will be carted off."

    who wishes, understandably, to remain anonymous.)

      It was just like an old Alan Ladd movie I saw with Veronica Lake.

      Leonard had long ago given up dreams of becoming another Ernie
    Pyle, the famous correspondent, Pulitzer Prize winner or great
    playwright.

      "I'm glad I'm not out on a night like this," Sarah said.
      "We need the rain, Sarah," David rebuked her.  He picked up
    the newspaper and was soon absorbed in its pages.

      Josh was at his sexual peek.

      "Oh," Madeline purred, "Those Scampies were so good -- we should
    go out for candlelit dinners more often."

      Sunday night was like a well-loved mistress, who had been
    beautiful and exciting and was now turning old and ugly and ready
    to be discarded to my book of memories.

      Stanley raced his mind, ignoring the grinding and screeching
    gears, to retrace what the hell had happened.

      Kathy liked going to the supermarket.  That was where she bumped
    into all her neighbors.

      Except for his eyes, which were dark and heavy lidded, he seemed
    to Josephine to be mostly nondescript and somewhat ponderously
    asexual.  But what of herself?  She looked down at her pendulous
    breasts, her varicose veins, the loose skin at her elbows, her
    stretch marks.  How distinctive was she?

      The country of Catalonia lies between France and Spain along
    the Mediterranean Sea like a misplaced wedge, as if squeezed
    between the super countries to keep them steady.

      "An omelet for mademoiselle," Jimmy announced, "and an 'am-
    burger pour moi."
      I think that was when I fell in love with him.

      "I went to J. R. Irving's house," she sobbed, "and he tried
    to have his way with me."
      "If you mean rape, I'm with you all the way," Donnie said.

      "Soot yourself, baby," Willy shrugged.

      Joanna loved to watch a fireplace burning.  It had a soothing
    effect on her spirits.

      Lunch whizzed by.

      People in these parts mine their own business, the sheriff
    told Terry.

      "I have no more tears to shed," sobbed Hanna Jerome as she
    faced her brother James, of medium height and slender.

      They made love in the master bedroom, where lovely Oriental
    courtesans watched them from the walls, and, perhaps, learned.

      "Make believe you're brave," she whistled, "like Mama always
    told you.

      As they sat by the fire this early April evening, Art said,
    "Think I'll unplug the TV.  Don't want the tube to blow."  He
    was a man of few words.

      The words gushed from Tom's mouth like water from a high-pressure
    hose.

      Sandy's most noticeable writing characteristic was her vivid
    imagination.

      Ned's eyes flutter open one at a time and he rolls over on
    his back.  His mouth tastes like cold peanut butter.

      He was not an unusual man.  His hair was streaked with gray
    and he was clean-shaven.  He weighed about 165 pounds and was
    about six feet tall -- or perhaps it should be six feet long,
    for when they found him he was stretched out on the sidewalk.
    He was dead.

      Joe liked the new policewoman.  She was smarter and better
    at filling out forms than he was.

      He had a gigolo's mouth, and a pawnbroker's eyes, but somehow
    all I could see was his surfer's body.

      Nelson, a very ambitious individual, enjoyed his job as a fiction
    writer for a small magazine.

      "Hold on to your seats," warned Sadie.  "This is a bazaar story."

Subj:   RE: Desperado #1146 and the 'colloquial expressions (?)' quiz...

        You spelled "Occam's Razor" wrong... (I think!) ...

        And before you ask, no, I haven't tried the quiz, but if I did, I'd
probably only score about a 70-75. HOWEVER, seeing as how a 100 is only
"passable", what's the point? (was the guy expecting someone to score higher
by inventing/using some that weren't on the list?).
        And the author expects HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS to be able to master that
list? Considering the statistics saying that many COLLEGE graduates can't
even SPELL correctly, let alone ignorance of past and current events, "Good
luck to you and the Red Sox".

You realize, of course, that when a sequel to this book or test comes

The book's been published, kids, and the list in the book is not 100 items
long, but *5000*. And they still claim that 100% is a passing grade. It's
a damning indictment of a permissive educational system. If we'd all learned
Latin and spent our evening reading Ethan Frome by candlelight, we could rip
through the cultural maze and write the great American user's guide.

    Loudmouth "Digies"

        I'm getting kind of fed up with these "digies," as they call
    them, people that are working for Digital, walking around, all of
    a sudden so uppity, because the stocks have gone up, and all of a
    sudden they're in a whole different class than everybody else.
        Cripes, I had a couple of them, friends of mine, that all of
    a sudden they get this sound like they've got $50,000 worth of
    stocks, and you never hear from them anymore.  I know they call
    them "Digies," but what do they have, some kind of special club,
    or maybe it's collusion or something.

                                        January 15th, 1928

        Mr. George Herman Ruth, Player
        New York Yankee Baseball Club
        Yankee Stadium
        New York, New York

        Dear Mr. Ruth,

        We sincerely regret to inform you that your recent  request  for
        baseball  bats  for  Spring  training  must be disapproved.  Our
        office has concluded a scientific,  null-time  analysis  of  bat
        usage  by  all  Yankee  team members.  Our null-time analysis of
        your bat usage follows:

            # of games            154
            # of bat usages       634
            Avg bat usage/game      4.1
            Avg time at bat         2.5 minutes
            Time usage per game    10.3 minutes
            Avg duration of game  143.2 minutes
            Null time             132.9 minutes   93%

        As I'm sure you can see, Mr. Ruth, it is not advisable to invest
        team capital in an asset area with 93% null time.

        In fact, our study was quite gracious as  we  ignored  the  fact
        that  most  players  have  more than one bat.  Our analysis also
        ignored the number of times that batters were walked  or  struck
        out.

        Have you considered bringing your bat with  you  in  the  field?
        That would cut its null time by 50%.

        We are still confused by your justification for a new bat  based
        on  setting  a record with 60 home runs last year.  I don't know
        what use a bat has for  running.   If  you  need  new  sneakers,
        please  fill  out a requisition for sneakers and we will process
        that request in accordance with Yankee team procedures.

        Thank you.

                                        Sincerely,

                                        Studd E.  Munee,

Subj:   Jokes #499: Friday, April 17th, 1987

                A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS

 1.  DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.
        Involvement with the patient's suffering might cause him
        to lose valuable scientific objectivity.

 2.  BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES.
        Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all
        the gentleness and reassurance he can get.

 3.  TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED.
        Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to
        uphold.

 4.  DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.
        You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight
        into the true nature of your illness, which transcends any
        mere permanent disability you may have experienced.

 5.  NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR
     WHY HE IS DOING IT.
        It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters
        could be explained in terms that you would understand.

 6.  SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT READILY.
        Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting
        research paper will surely be of widespread interest.

 7.  PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.
        You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however
        modestly, to the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.

 8.  DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.
        It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond
        your means.

 9.  NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT
     IN THE COURSE OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.
        The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and
        you have a sacred duty to protect him from exposure.

10.  NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS
     DIRECT CARE.
        This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.
