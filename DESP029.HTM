This has been affecting my mental health:

Your DESPERADO header should be punctuated properly, as befits a journal
produced by the writer to end all writers:

        DESPERADO -- The best bang since the Big One

                        or

        DESPERADO:  If you've got the bucket, we've got the bits.

 I prefer the first rendition, but either would be better than that unsightly
comma.

Is an unsightly comma worse than an unsoundly CTRL/G?

Actually, I spent much of this weekend pondering the location and role
of that comma, and I decided it should stay.  It's kind of crazy,
isn't it?

I am relieved to hear that "sign off" is not a DECism. Where did "buy
in" as a synonym for consensus originate? Many strange words, cliches,
phrases, and pieces of jargon float around here. Often I want to know
whether something is DEC jargon, computer jargon, computer slang
(different from jargon), electronics jargon, management jargon, etc.
Every strange phrase I hear can't be a DECism.

By the way, I have been at Digital close to 9 years and never until
this year heard employees refer to themselves as Digits, but it seems
to be in common company-wide usage now.

"Buy in" comes from auctions, I think, where a vanquished bidder can
form a combination with someone still in the bidding.

I just got back from seeing Muppet creator Jim Henson's new fantasy
epic, "The Dark Crystal" (a wonderful movie) at the Harvard Square
Theatre.

DESPERADOes who wish to see this excellent film should plan on doing
so somewhere other than the Harvard Square.  The theatre has
just reopened amid much ballyhoo, after extensive remodeling, so we
went there with fairly high expectations.  Cambridge-area DESPERADOes
no doubt remember the place as a grungehole that specialized in showing
chopped-up prints.  In its new incarnation, it turns out to be a
slightly spiffed-up grungehole that specializes in chopping up prints.

About fifteen minutes into the film, at the beginning of an important scene,
the sound was lost. After several minutes and prompting from the restless
audience, sound was restored, but the film was not rewound so that the scene
could be seen and heard in its entirety.  Both at the time and afterwards, the
members of our party complained about the situation to the management.  Each
time the people in charge showed more concern about their own problems than
about the audience's inconvenience.

They were real SOBs about the whole thing, and refused to consider
apologies, refunds, or passes.  They made it clear that they don't give a
damn about movies or about what the audience thinks -- as they put it, "We
didn't beg you to come here."

This kind of attitude drives me crazy, and indeed, I will not return
to these assh*le's movie palace again.  I urge DESPERADOes to do the same,
and not patronize this place.

I beg to differ with KIRK::TABER regarding the uselessness of the American
Heritage Dictionary (at least the hardcover version).

First, my 1970 hardcover edition does in fact list potlatch (A ceremonial
feast among Indians living on the Pacific coast of WA, BC, and AL, at the
end of which the host gives valuable material goods to the guests who
belong to other kin groups or destroys property to show that he can afford
to do so.)

Second, there are no fewer than 24 Indian xxx words listed from Indian bean
to Indian tobacco.

Third, it is the only dictionary I have every seen which has a Scrabble-
acceptable word which contains a q but no u, namely qoph (the English name
of the nineteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet).

Finally, it was computer-composed in Maynard!  (Somebody will probably say
that Inforonics, the company that did it, uses Brand X computers, so I will
admit right now that I don't know, and that the composition location is not
a particularly important consideration in choosing a dictionary.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The first side of the Talking Heads's live album "The Name of this Band
is Talking Heads" was recorded in Maynard as a live-audience-in-the-studio
experiment at Northern Sound Studios.  It was not computer-generated,
and does not sound like it, regardless of what you think the Talking
Heads sound.

Now here's an important question for lingo-freaks:  What is the
plural of Desperado? Desperados?  Desperadoes?  I favor the former,
but the contributors seem to favor the latter.

Here's a Classic for the Newspaper Headlines series:

This was on the front page of the DAILY MIRROR (a national tabloid paper) here
in the UK on Thursday, 16th December:

                    "ELTON'S FLYING STOOL HITS FAN"

It actually refers to an incident at a concert Elton John was giving. His
drummer (Nigel Olsen?) had failed to turn up so Elton got in a huff. He'd had
enough half way through 'Bennie and the Jets' so he got up from his piano,
kicked his stool away and walked off the stage in a temper. Unfortunately, the
stool hit a female fan in the front row.

(Hope the alternative meaning isn't lost in American English!)

RE: REX::MINOW"s recipes:

I went to the same cooking class at the Cambridge Center for Adult
Education --- The Chocolate Orgy. (The class was a birthday present
from friends who were guilty about nagging me for my girth.) Here are
the recipes from the class. Do not eat any of them without keeping a
syringe full of insulin handy.

1. CHOCOLATE DECADENCE          for 12 gluttons

        INGREDIENTS

1 LB. DARK SWEET CHOCOLATE
4 OZ. SWEET (UNSALTED) BUTTER
4 LARGE EGGS
1 TBS. SUGAR
1 TBS. FLOUR
1 CUP COLD HEAVY CREAM
1 TSP. VANILLA EXTRACT
8 OZ. RASPBERRIES
                                       o
        DIRECTIONS  Preheat oven to 425  F.

1. Butter and flour a cake pan and line it with waxed paper (also
buttered).  (HINT: Use a spring-form pan and be easy on yourself.)

2. Melt chocolate with butter in a double boiler over hot water. (Note
"over": be careful not to scald the chocolate.)

3. Whip together eggs and sugar over simmering water until tepid.
Remove from heat; continue whipping until they have tripled in volume.
(HINT: Use a very large bowl and a very large whip -- it's much
easier.)

4. Sift flour over the eggs and fold in. Fold the egg and flour
mixture into the chocolate, then pour it all into the cake pan.

5. Bake just fifteen minutes.

6. Let cool and then freeze. (You may want to remove it from the cake
pan before freezing -- hence the spring-form.)  Remove from freezer
1 hour before serving time. Top with pureed or whole raspberries and
whipped cream (with sugar and vanilla.) (By the way, we used frozen
raspberries in the class, and they were fine. What the hell -- it's
the chocolate that's important, right? Not some damned fruit.)

2 TBS. GRAN MARNIER, KALHUA, or CHAMBORD
3 CUPS FRESHLY BREWED COFFEE
1 CUP WHIPPED CREAM

        DIRECTIONS

liqueurs. (Remember to warm the liqueur before igniting
it. And let's be careful out there.)

2. Ladle coffee into mugs; top with whipped cream -- sprinkled with
ground cinnamon or coffee grounds (say, a good instant, like
Megdalia D'Oro -- or however you spell it).
**********************************************************************
            \
3. POT-DE-CREME/CHOCLOATE MOUSSE        for 6

2 EGG YOLKS
2 WHOLE EGGS
1 CUP HEAVY CREAM
1 TBS. ORANGE RIND (optional)

        DIRECTIONS Using a blender or food processor

1. Melt chocolate ...

2. Blend eggs and yolks for 30 seconds.

3. Blend in liqueur for 60 seconds.

4. Blend in melted chocolate until just incorporated. Add cream and
blend.

5. Set in mold or in pots-de-creme; refrigerate for a few hours.

6. Serve plain or topped with whipped cream.

There is also a recipe for  a calories-reduced version of the
chocolate mousse. If anyone's interested, I'll pass it along.

4. Mole Poblano

Ingredients

2 chickens                              1/2 C. peanuts or peanut butter
1/2 lb. lard                            1 clove garlic
2 seeded chilis                         1 Tbs. toasted sesame seeds
2 peeled tomatoes                       1 1/2 Tbs. chili powder
1 med. onion, chopped                   2 C. chicken stock
1 fried tortilla                        1 bay leaf
3 oz. bitter chocolate, melted          salt
        1/4 C Apricots, diced -- optional

Directions
                          o
1. Preheat the oven to 350.
2. Cut up the chicken into serving pieces and brown in pure raging
lard for 20 minutes. Place in casserole.
3. Toast fresh chilis and remove skins and seeds. (See Note.)
4. Saute onion, garlic, chilis in chicken drippings for 5 minutes or
so.
5. Add tomatoes, salt, bay leaf, spices, and stock. Simmer another 5,
maybe 10, minutes.
6. Blend with the rest of the ingredients until smooth.
7. Pour over the chicken and bake for 15 minutes or so.
8. Serve with tortillas or over rice. Forget wine -- splurge on
Mexican beer --- Dos Equis, Carta Blanca, Superior, Bohemia ---
or the very excellent Philipine beer San Miguel.

NOTE:

Fresh chilis are available in some supermarkets. The Stop &amp; Shop on
Memorial Drive sometimes has them (packaged by Frieda's of California)
in their produce section. If you're very adventurous (and licensed to
carry automatic weapons) you can find them in some ethnic neighbor-
hoods like parts of Roxbury and Dorchester.
        Fresh chilis (serranos, jalapeno, etc.) are extremely caustic
little critters. Be very careful in deveining and seeding them. The
oil will smart like hell. Keep your hands away from your eyes when you
are working on them, or, even better, wear a pair of disposable rubber
gloves (sold in drug stores or hospital supply stores). I speak from
agonizing experience. You can also get canned chilis (Ortega, El Paso,
other brands) which are less volatile.
        Re toasting the chilis: see cookbooks by Elizabeth Lambert
Ortiz or Diane Kennedy. There is also a decent Mexican cookbook in the
Betty Crocker series, for God's sake, written by the owner-chef of
Casa Romero, the very expensive (and pretty fair) restaurant in Back
Bay.
        Finally, mole sauces are very rich. You might want to serve
this as part of a Mexican smorgasbord. Also, since the chilis
are hot, even after you have cooked the hell out of the little
critters, you might  want to have more or less plain rice available --
rice or plain bread absorbs some of the caustic oils and cools the
palate much better than does drinking water or even (hate to admit it)
beer. If you've never had a mole and want to try it before you make
it, I suggest you eat at Sol Azteca, on Beacon Street, near the
Boston-Brookline line. (Take the Green Line --- the MBTA needs the
money and it's hard to park around there.)

A merkin, for the record, was once a very different beastie than what it is
now - back in the days of muzzle-loading cannon, a merkin was the long-handled
wet mop that was run down the bore to ensure that any sparks from the past
discharge were out before recharging.  Now, the question is (and I do NOT have
an answer) how did the meaning change so radically?

"Keep it clean", eh?  Feh!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
So there *was* an original meaning.  I don't understand the "now".  I
haven't seen either kind in years.  The meaning did not really change
so radically.  I imagine that encountering any merkin would tend to
dampen sparks.  The shape and appearance also remained the same.

Seeing WMEX mentioned brings back all kinds of memories from my childhood.
I think Dick Sommer was the fellow with the funny song.  He used to do a
late night program that included the adventures of Theopolus Q. Waterhouse,
Detective. (I have no idea what the correct spelling of Theopolus is, but
mine gives you the idea.)  That was back in the days when MAD magazine was
the nation's leading humor periodical, so you know it happened a long time
ago.  Many of the old WMEX people are at WBZ now. (Larry Glick, Dave Maynard,
Jerry Williams are the only ones I can think of off hand.)

Merkins, the kid was told long ago, came into fashion during the middle ages
because natural hair tended to attract lice and such things, and so was
usually shaven off.  However, to restore the "natural" look when there was
someone to look merkins were used.  I suspect they had more use providing
a provocative dark area under light coloured thin clothing than they had
in the clinch.  After all, even with our modern glues and stickums people's
toupees still pop off at bad times.  Woman's answer to the codpiece, they
were more brag than fact.

It's always interesting talking to people from the school systems of

Philip Reis invented the telephone.  He did, indeed, fool around with

a day, and on Sundays, suddenly started to catch on.  Everyone had to jump on
the bandwagon to stay in competition.  One chain on Long Island, which couldn't
find any reason to stay open (really early) Sunday mornings, came up with the
following description of their hours:

A farmer having problems with people stealing watermelons erected a sign read-
ing "WARNING -- THIS FIELD CONTAINS 1 POISONED WATERMELON".

The next morning, tacked on to the bottom of the sign, was one reading:
"NOW THERE ARE 2".
