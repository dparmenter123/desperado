            Digital Announces New Operating System Package

                 MACHO System to Appeal to Hard-Core

                          Software Engineers

Digital Equipment Corporation  announced  the  MACHO  bounded  system.
This  system  is  created by taking an RSX-11M system and removing any
software or hardware that might be  described  as  user-friendly  (the
pieces  of  user-friendly  hardware/software  supplied with RSX can be
counted on  the  thumbs  of  one  hand,  so  this  should  not  impact
functionality).

With MACHO you don't get:

      o  EDT

         This editor is much too easy.

      o  PIP

         This utility can easily be used by almost  anyone,  therefore
         it has no place in the MACHO system.

      o  RMS

         People who use RMS are wimps.  Wimps don't use MACHO.  RMS is
         out, QED.

      o  Compilers

         People who use compilers are megawimps.  If  God  had  wanted
         programmers to use compilers, why did She invent MACRO?

      o  A console TTY

         Digital has almost 7 million unused switch panels.  What  are
         we supposed to do, eat them?  If you can't read octal numbers
         from the panel lights, see figure one.

      o  PATCH

         As we see it, object code is pretty close to  human-readable.
         Including PATCH would be as bad as including EDT.

With MACHO you get:

      o  TECO

         The Real Man's Editor.  Old TECO  had  a  command  for  every
         letter.   MACHO TECO has a command for every character in the
         DEC Multinational Character Set.

      o  FLX

         The syntax for this utility is bizarre  enough  to  suit  the
         most macho of MACHO users.

      o  ODT

         We tried to invent BDT (Binary Debugging Technique) for V1 of
         MACHO,  but  the developer broke down and became a structured
         programming consultant.  What a wimp.

      o  RP03 disks

         Having a 36-bit data path, and requiring users  to  terminate
         their  own  data  transfers,  these  beauties  are  enough to
         satisfy the most discriminating hard-core hackers.

      o  ZAP

         Works just as on other systems except  you  can't  specify  a
         file  specification.   It ZAPs something, and you have to use
         ODT to find out what.

Subj:   Information Sharing     [From CINTEREST]

I've had a request to forward the names of people internal to the corporation
using VAX-11 C to implement products.

One individual would like to know so he can ponder the possibility of allowing
C into the hallowed halls of BLISS et. al. as an "official" DEC implementation
language.  Others want to share inside tidbits, etc.  We (the development
group) are constrained by time from coordinating this kind of activity.

So, if you are interested in sharing your experiences, etc. please contact
Ron Johnston (TURTLE::JOHNSTON) and/or John McConnell (XENON::MCCONNELL).

Subject: Indian corn

I don't know much about autumn leaves' color, but I have worked on a farm
for a few years and know a bit about Indian corn. Indian corn is a type of
flint corn. The other kind is called dent corn. The difference is in how
the kernels dry; flint corn (e.g. Indian corn and popcorn) dry from the
outside in, producing a hard (flint-like) covering, while dent corn (sweet
corn, ensilage corn) dries from the inside out (more or less),
causing the kernels to dent, or wrinkle up.

You can pop Indian corn and eat it (I've done it), but it doesn't taste all
that good, and about half of the kernels won't pop.

The colors just grow that way, you don't have to do anything to them.
Multiple ears on one stalk are all of the same color and pattern. I don't
know the science of how or why they get that way. As George Lamontagne
observed on the subject of leaves, don't worry about the science, just
enjoy 'em.

Indian corn has not been extensively hybridized; it is known as
open-pollinated. This means that you can plant the seeds from your Indian
corn next year and get equally good Indian corn the next fall. This is
*only if* the farmer didn't plant another variety of corn (such as sweet
corn) near it. Indian corn will cross pollinate with any other type of
corn, and the results of the cross are unpredictable.

TRUE STORY:

My brother also worked on this particular farm, and they used to have a
booth at the Topsfield Fair, selling cider and pumpkins and Indian corn,
etc.  He was working the booth one evening when three middle-aged ladies
approached, deep in discussion. They hung around in front of the booth for
about a minute before one of the women stepped up, pointed to the Indian
corn, and asked "How do they get those beautiful colors?".

Kurt replied, "It's genetic - they naturally grow that way."

"No, really, how do you do it?"

"Honest, they just grow that way."

The woman and her companions walked off, and the one woman said to her
friends "I KNEW he wouldn't tell me..."

        NEW PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TO THE FIELD

DEC is pleased to announce its JUST-IN-TIME ENGINEERING program.

Concern about lagging productivity and foreign competition, led the DEC
management to take a bold step last year.  They have adopted the Japanese
KANDU or JUST IN TIME methods in the engineering department.  The KANDU
method attacks the resource management problem head on by forcing emphasis
on utilising the minimum of resources to produce a given item.  Resource
management is seen to be an important market factor in the coming years
and DEC believes in using what it preaches.  The results to date of the
program have been impressive.  We are currently engineering the same
product set with approximately half the previous engineering staff.
As a result we feel confident that we can continue this trend and
increase our output.

Therefore we will make this program available for the field.  No longer
do you have to tell a customer we don't have that product.  Just book
it and automatically with the just-in-time engineering program we
will have the product in time for the scheduled ship.

We know it sounds amazing, but we're the NEW DIGITAL and were changing
the way people work.

        JAPAN is # 1 LIAR OF WW II HISTORY

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Japan's centralized school system has recently adopted new textbooks
that toned down WW II considerable.  The "rape of Nanking" became the
"confusion at Nanking" if I remember correctly.  *Many* Japanese were
disturbed by the rewrite of history.

Why is a native North American bird named the same as a country in
Asia?

It seems that just prior to the colonization of New World, the English
people were fond of eating a game bird that looked something like a
large Grouse. This bird had been brought to England from the "East" and
since at the time, everthing East of France was "Turkey" the bird was
nicknamed "Turkey Bird."

When the settlers arrived in the Colonies they discovered that the
Native Americans had obviously visited the land East of France because
they were fond of a similar game bird.

This discovery lent more credibility to the belief that Columbus had actually
found China.

Here in Seattle we know the origin of the bird's name because the natives
here refer to everyone living East of Spokane as turkeys. Especially those in
the other Washington.

Subj:   reply to Desperado - (all us 33,500 below average employees greet you)

RE: your comments about the brochures' inaccurate information.   I think I
have the numbers figured out.  Hold onto your hat:

N = (UxS)xV, where

N is the number of VMS systems installed last year, to be calculated
U is the number of updates installed on a single VAX (2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.0)
S is the number of installations per update (this could include a second try
        by the software specialist doing the update, or additional builds for
        different system disks or hardware configurations).  Let the average
        be 3.
V is the number of VAX's in our customer base.  Note that using this formula,
        we do not have to know how many were SOLD last year, just how many
        are out there altogether).

In my calculations I find N (the 30,400 reported by the brochure) to be really
72,000 or so.  MY!!! HOW CONSERVATIVE OUR BROCHURES ARE!!!

Note that semantically, I am treating "installed" as a verb, and you were
thinking of it as an adjective, modifying "VAX's" or "VMS systems".

I, frankly, am more concerned with the New "Systems and Options Summary" for
VAX, where it is stated the 782's support, as a standard configuration,
1.3 RP07's.
