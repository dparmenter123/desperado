Brown 2 lbs of hamburger in a dutch oven (a large one). Discard
excess grease. Add 1 large chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic (diced),
1 medium green pepper (cut into strips). Add an entire can of chili
powder (one of the little rectangular cans) and an envelope of Old El
Paso Taco Mix. Stir the resulting mess while browning over moderate
heat for about 8 minutes.

                          END OF PHASE I

Add a 28-oz can of peeled tomatoes (in water or tomato juice) -- slash
at the tomatoes with a knife to make them smaller. Add a hefty shake
of salt (Lawry's, if available), a dash of tobasco, a sprinkle of
cumin seed, some Worcestershire sauce. Boil all this, then add 2 16-oz
cans of kidney beans (do not drain). Boil again, then turn as low as
possible and simmer.

                          END OF PHASE II

*At a minimum,* you should simmer 1 hour with the cover on and 45
minutes with the cover off. During this time, sample the product and
fiddle with seasoning as desired. Stir from time to time. The final
consistency can be controlled by the amount of time you simmer with
the cover off.

                          END OF PHASE III

Eat chili. Serve with grated cheddar cheese (a Mouli grater is almost
indispensible for the cheese), diced onions, and oyster crackers to
sprinkle on top of it. Loves to be refrigerated/frozen and reheated.

                          IBM FIELD APPLICATION NOTE:

                      IDENTIFICATION OF RIGHT AND LEFT HAND

    INTRODUCTION

    In technical field work it is often desirable, if not necessary, to
    distinquish between right and left which, to some IBM field personnel,
    may present a problem.  Examples are:  components being located on the
    right or left, controls having to be moved to the right or left, etc.
    Persons having difficulties in this regard are occasionally admonished
    to have reference to their right or left hand, respectively; this,
    however, tends to be of little use if the particular person has
    difficulty in identification of his right and left hand.

    PURPOSE

    The purpose of this application note is to aid IBM field personnel in
    the correct identification of the right and left hand, with the highest
    probability of success and with considerable ease.  Having accomplished
    such identification, the person will be able, by straight analogy, to
    transfer the directional characterization to the item(s) in question.

    EQUIPMENT REQUIRED

            Table, qty. 1 (or equivalent)
            Clock, qty. 1
            Indelible marker, any color, qty. 1

    PROCEDURE

    Identification of the right and left hand may be accomplished by
    following the procedure given here, in the indicated sequence:

    1. Place the clock on the surface of the table, work-bench, or other
       flat, horizontal furniture or equipment surface with its face toward
       you.

                                     NOTE
            If you have trouble determining which side of the clock is
            the face, refer to "IBM Field Application Note: Using
            Clocks and Watches to Tell Time".

    2. With arms parallel, or nearly parallel, place both of your hands
       upon the surface of the table (or work-bench) with the clock between
       them.

                                      NOTE
            It is assumed that the person in question has two hands,
            which is generally the case.  In situations other than the
            one assumed, the procedure given here is not applicable.

    3. Note whether the two thumbs are the two similar digits of the
       respective hands that are in closest relative proximity.  If this is
       the case, step 4 may be omitted.

    4. Counter-rotate the two hands in such a manner as to accomplish the
       criterion of step 3.

                      *  *  *  *  *  WARNING  *  *  *  *  *

            Neither hand should be rotated more than 180 degrees.
            Should this appear required, rotation in the opposite
            direction is indicated, instead, to prevent possible
            injury.

    5. Observe the relative position of each thumb with respect to its
       corresponding hand and with respect to the clock in front of you.

    6. With the indelible marker, mark the hand that has the thumb closest
       to the "9" of the clock with a letter "R", and the hand that has the
       thumb closest to the "3" of the clock with the letter "L".

    CONCLUSION

    The hand bearing the "L" mark will be the right hand, and the hand
    bearing the "R" mark will be the left hand.

Subject: Good DEC news.

Has anyone noticed the series of magazine ads that DEC has been running for
the past few months in the trade press?  Whoever is responsible for them
deserves a round of applause (and a handful of attaboys).

Each of the ads has a common theme:  interconnectability.  They stress that
our products are compatable with one another, and that they have a wide
range of hardware and software peripherals.  They have a few catchy
slogans, "The best engineered computers in the world", "Engineered to a
plan", etc.  They're pleasant to look at with interesting pencil drawings
and an effective use of color.  They contain two pages of informative,
well-written text.  The ones I've seen all stress big VAXes, microVAXes,
microPDP's, and Pro350's (with pretty graphics on their screens).

The general impression I've gotten from the ads is that Digital is an
engineering-oriented company that's easy to work with, with a wide range of
interesting and useful products.  Not a bad message to spread, eh?

Congrats, Mr. Marketing.

  Note #170                 -{ Try out VOICEMAIL! }-               5 responses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                DECTALK/VAXMAIL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

        Internal Software Services (ISWS) has integrated DECtalk and
        VAXmail to offer a solution for remote VAXmail access through
        touch tone telephone connection when no direct terminal is
        available.  The prototype of this integration is called VOICE-
        mail.  VOICEmail is currently installed for demonstration on
        the ENET node, VORTEX.

        VOICEmail does not require the user to understand DECtalk or
        the VMS operating system.  It is user friendly and requires
        elementary level skills.

        The simplicity of accessing VAXmail messages using VOICEmail
        can be described in the following steps:

                a)  First, send a test message to VORTEX::VOICEMAIL

                b)  Second, dial the telephone number (DTN 264-1785)
                    to access VOICEmail on VORTEX

                c)  Third, enter the user code 1# for the VOICEMAIL account.

                d)  Fourth, enter valid VOICEmail response (listed later)

                e)  Fifth, terminate VOICEmail (# *)

        The use of VOICEmail requires minimal hardware.  Hardware require-
        ments include 1) telephone line, and 2) DECtalk equipment.  These
        hardware requirements have been installed on VORTEX.

        Features of VOICEmail include:

        Audible HELP    -       Press the number sign (#) twice

        READ            -       Press   R E  #  to read the next message

        BACKUP          -       Press   B A  #  to read the preceding message

        Access to a specific    Press   R E  (message number) # for specific msg

        DIRECTORY       -       Press   D I  #  to obtain a directory of msgs

        Message interruption    Press   *   to interrupt the current message

        Exit            -       Press   #  *   to exit VOICEmail

        For additional information on VOICEmail contact Carol A. Armistead,
        Internal Software Product Manager, Internal Software Services,
        PKO1-1/C2 by interoffice mail, on DTN 223-3307, or through
        VAXmail on CYGNUS::Armistead.

Oh, Tom, you rascal--

As always, in times of perplexity and adversity, I turn to the Working Woman's
Friend and Faithful Compendium, Desperado. Our problem today, music fans, is
resource identification. All of my favorite hymns, I realized the other day,
are attributed to the old Southern hymnal SOUTHERN HARMONY. I speak of hymns
like Amazing Grace and My Shepherd Will Supply My Need and Wondrous Love
and all the rousers that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up and
say Howdy. Now my question to the Desperadim is, does anyone know of a modern
edition of Southern Harmony? Either a straight reproduction or a modern
rendering. There are dozens of octavo editions of individual hymns, but I am
looking for the whole nine yards, the whole ball of wax. I would be eternally
grateful, as always, for helpful directions or comments or recipes for Hoppin'
John or anything even remotely relevant.

                      Yours from the depths of Friday afternoon,

Us Southern Methodists used the Cokesbury Hymn Book , but I don't have a
copy of that either.  I loved Fanny J. Crosby's hymns best of all.
One of my Baptist cousins was attracted intellectually to the
Unitarian church, but decided that he just couldn't go to a church
where they didn't sing Washed in the Blood of the Lamb.

Estupendia Gracia, by the way, is the Portuguese title given to a
lovely rendition of Amazing Grace by Nana Vasaconcela [not spelled
right] on the album, As Falls Witchita, So Falls Wichita Falls by Pat
Metheny and Lyle Mays which is one of my nominees for
listen-to-it-forever music.

;Got this list from a recent issue of BOSTON magazine.

In Massachusettes, it is against the law to:

        1) Feed Razor blades to a pig

        2) Construct an "infernal device" that causes destruction,chaos,death
           (gee, then ban cars from the roads...)

        3) Use a Golfball that will explode/ignite upon impact.  Fine of
           $500.00 for 1st offense, $5000.00/1 year in jail for repeated
           offenders.

        4) Use a machine gun for hunting

        5) Water ski at night

        6) Paint/disguise a race-horse

        7) Destroy/deface a Cranberry bush.  (Cranberries are the state drink)

        8) Employ anyone under the age of 15 as a contortionist

In the city of Boston:

        1) Undertakers are forbidden using foul language in the presence of
           a dead body.

        2) You must be buried a minimum of 3' in the ground

        3) You must be buried between sunrise/sunset

        4) Performing an 'ultimate' sexual act in public, or showing a
           book/device that shows an 'ultimate sexual act'
           (Wonder what an 'ultimate sexual act' is?)

        5) store more than 2 cords of manure in your stable.  (I wonder
           (where they got that measurement...)

        6) Wash your pet/vehicle in public.  Washing your pet/vehicle will be
