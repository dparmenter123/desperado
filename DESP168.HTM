This is a quick one before I jump into Eastern's arms and get wafted
off to Jacksonville, there to begin one of the longer airport-hotel
transfers I've experienced, involving, as it does, taxis and ferries.
Although not to be compared with the night we arrived in Athens
and were told that our hotel didn't exist. Spent the night at the
George V, one of the last grand hotels in Europe, and then walked
from Syntagma Square to the American Embassy (oog...my feet still
hurt.) Two days later, we found our hotel and went there in somebody's
Fiat 500. Them was the days. I'll write you a trip report when we
get back and tell you all about the roseate spoonbills and the
oystercatchers and Bubba the Deer, fabled in song and story. Don't
eat breakfast on the lawn, Bubba is bigger than you are.

                    Before the Big Bang:
          News From the Hubble Large Space Telescope

              The Astronomer was red-eyed, pale,
                his face was gray with stubble;
                 he was 13 on a sliding scale
                    of 1 to 10 in trouble.

                "Is Physics just a fairy tale?"
               he asked, and then began to wail,
               "Why DID we seek the holy grail?
                 Why did we launch the Hubble?

              The launch was good (relax, exhale)
                 the data systems did not fail
               we peered beyond the cosmic veil,
                    the anti-cosmic double

              to back before the quarks prevail.
                 We digitized each dark detail
                  but it was all to no avail,
                 it burst our pretty bubble."

               "WHAT did you see?" I asked "Before
                   Beginning Big Bang lights?"
       (I reviews and interviews. I edits and I writes.)
     "Before the start of Time, before the Universe's Birth,
 What DID the Hubble show, ten billion years before the Earth?"
               He told me. Now I writes no more.
                    I drinks a bit. I edits.
             "Right before the Beginning," he said,
                "is when THEY roll the credits!"

The Canberra Times, Wed, Feb 3, 1988, page 3.

                                CORRECTION

For some considerable time, The Canberra Times has been publishing the wrong
tide times for Narooma.  The error has been in arithmetical calculation in
this office of the difference between tide times at Fort Denison as published
in standard tide tables and times at Narooma.  The error, the source of which
is lost in antiquity, was discovered last week when the editor, relying on
The Canberra Times figures, was swept out to sea.  But he managed to return
to shore - and ordered this correction.

                 that will tide him over until next time.  PGN]

Subj:   Carpet test hallway: walk normally

Let us not be contemptuous of the carpet-test hallway; it's perfectly obvious
once you get there.  And the directions are perfect -- they got me there.

Reminds me of one of my favorite highway signs, though, which I saw over two
decades ago hitchhiking through northern New Jersey.  We passed over a crazy
sequence of stripes painted across the road, and looking over to the side I saw
my sign:

        PAINT TEST DRIVE NORMALLY

As if that were possible in North Jersey!  (Or does living in the Boston area
disqualify me from making any comment on traffic or roads, forever?)

The "carpet test hallway" really exists on 6-3 in the mill.  There's
an office space up there, now inhabited by part of PTO (Process and
Technology Office), that used to belong to Facilities.  Facilities
wanted to test wear on carpeting, to see which brand lasted the
longest, so they put several samples of different colors and weaves
down the lenth of the hallway outside that office.  Then, like the
rest of Digital, they moved, and left the carpeting.

That's what I heard, anyway.  I worked for PTO this year in that
office space, and that carpet is right there for all to see.  Whoever
can actually get there following the instructions, that is.

Subj:   For DESPERADO - guess I just missed the latest issue

Seeing as it's coming up on New Hampshire primary time again, I thought
the following text would be amusing and educational.  This item has long
been one of my favorites from MAD.

  MAD's Guaranteed Effective All-Occasion Non-Slanderous Political Smear Speech

      writer: Bill Garvin                      from MAD #139, December 1970

  My fellow citizens, it is an honor and a pleasure to be here today.  My
opponent has openly admitted he feels an affinity toward your city, but I
happen to like this area.  It might be a salubrious place to him, but to me
it is one of the nation's most delightful garden spots.

  When I embarked upon this political campaign, I hoped that it could be
conducted on a high level and that my opponent would be willing to stick
to the issues.  Unfortunately, he has decided to be tractable instead - to
indulge in unequivocal language, to eschew the use of outright lies in his
speeches, and even to make repeated veracious statements about me.

  At first I tried to ignore these scrupulous, unvarnished fidelities.  Now
I will do so no longer.  If my opponent wants a fight, he's going to get one!

  It might be instructive to start with his background.  My friends, have you
ever accidentally dislodged a rock on the ground and seen what was underneath?
Well, exploring my opponent's background is dissimilar.  All the slime and
filth and corruption you can possibly imagine, even in your wildest dreams,
are glaringly nonexistent in this man's life.  And even in his childhood!

  Let us take a very quick look at that childhood:  It is a known fact that,
on a number of occasions, he emulated older boys at a certain playground.
It is also known that his parents not only permitted him to masticate in their
presence, but even urged him to do so.  Most explicable of all, this man who
poses as a paragon of virtue exacerbated his own sister when they were both
teenagers!

  I ask you, my fellow Americans: is this the kind of person we want in
public office to set an example for our youth?

  Of course, it's not surprising that he should have such a typically
pristine background - no, not when you consider the other members of his
family:

  His female relatives put on a constant pose of purity and innocence, and
claim they are inscrutable, yet every one of them has taken part in hortatory
activities.

  The men in the family are likewise completely amenable to moral suasion.

  My opponent's uncle was a flagrant heterosexual.

  His sister, who has always been obsessed by sects, once worked as a
proselyte outside a church.

  His father was secretly chagrined at least a dozen times by matters of a
pecuniary nature.

  His youngest brother wrote an essay extolling the virtues of being a homo
sapiens.

  His nephew subscribes to a phonographic magazine.

  And his own mother had to resign from a women's organization in her later
years because she was an admitted sexagenarian.

  Now what shall we say about the man himself?

  I can tell you in solemn truth that he is the very antithesis of political
radicalism, economic irresponsibility and personal depravity.  His own record
proves that he has prequently discountenanced treasonable, un-American
philosophies and has perpetrated many overt acts as well.

  He perambulated his infant on the street.

  He practiced nepotism with his uncle and first cousin.

  He attempted to interest a 13-year-old girl in philately.

  He participated in a seance at a private residence where, among other odd
goings-on, there was incense.

  He has declared himself in favor of more homogeneity on college campuses.

  He has advocated social intercourse in mixed company - and has taken part
in such gatherings himself.

  He has been deliberately averse to crime in our city streets.

  He has urged our Protestant and Jewish citizens to develop more catholic
tastes.

  Last summer he committed a piscatorial act on a boat that was flying the
U.S. flag.

  Finally, at a time when we must be on our guard against all foreign isms,
he has cooly announced his belief in altruism - and his fervent hope that
some day this entire nation will be altruistic!

  I beg you, my friends, to oppose this man whose life and work and ideas are
so openly and avowedly compatible with our American way of life.  A vote for
him would be a vote for the perpetuation of everything we hold dear.

  The facts are clear; the record speaks for itself.  Do your duty.

Happy 1988

The 30th year of the company is over.  The future will not be like the
past.  The thinking that accounted for our success in the past 30 years
will not hold for the next 30.

The center of gravity of the company has changed in fundamental
and permanent ways.  It can be seen everywhere you turn, in products,
business, technology, and workforce.  I believe the company will
operate more effectively if those areas are on the same
wavelength; some real synergies and efficiencies could result.

* In two years, we will have as many people in Europe as in Massachusetts.

* In FY93, we will have more people outside the US than in US.

* We have moved from being a hardware equipment company to an applications
  company, from being a computer company to an information technology company.
  We have gone from data to enterprise.

* I believe we are on the "wrong" Fortune 500 list, Industrial instead
  of Services, but that is still being played out.

* We have gone from being a matrix organization to a networking/networked
  organization.

* We have moved from our original niche of engineering/scientific markets
  to a full-spectrum computer company, including all commercial areas.

* We are selling "higher in the organization": our target is not just the
  MIS manager in the computer room but the CIO in the executive suite.

* Sam Fuller says our Basic Computing Unit was components, is networks,
  will be distributed systems.

* I say our basic work unit was individuals, is departments, and will be
  dispersed collaborators.

* The lines between our employees, suppliers, and customers are blurring.

* The lines between regular and temporary employees and contractors/consultants
  are blurring.

* The distinctions between technologies are blurring, as are those between
  workspaces: office, conference room, classroom are becoming metamorphic,
  and thus interchangeable.

* Some words that will become realities in the 1990s: converging, merging,
  hybrid, flexible, integrated, global...

* Information is no longer hoarded, it is shared.  Knowledge is not exclusive,
  it is inclusive.  Expertise is not concentrated, it is dispersed.

* It is a new world with new realities and new rules that calls for new
  thinking.

A Knotty Problem

A tie tightly knotted on the throat looks professional, but it could hurt your
performance on the job, say Cornell University researchers Leonora
Langan-Trespasz and Susan Watkins.  Twenty-two men wearing tight ties and
collars and ten men with open collars were recently tested for visual response
time.  The result: Those with the restrictive neckwear scored significantly
lower - probably due to diminished blood flow to the retina.  This could be bad
news for pilots, computer operators or anyone who needs to react quickly, says
Watkins.  And evidence suggests the decreased circulation might well affect not
only the eyes but the brain too - with a decline in reasoning ability a
possible consequence.  Watkins tells of men who complained they felt
"irritable, confused and unable to think" when wearing ties that were tied too
securely.  And a military study reported dizziness and blackouts among
soldiers whose spit and polish included excessively tight ties.  Such problems
may not be rare: The Cornell investigators found that two thirds of ninety-four
businessmen they surveyed wore neckwear smaller than their necks, and of these.
12 percent had ties noosed up to a half inch less than their neck size.  Best
advice for uptight dressers: Loosen up!
----------------------------------------
So the question is ---

        Does tight neckwear cause sluggish response?     or

        Are Managers too stupid to wear the right size clothes?

Well now,some of those guys are pretty neat. The glass harmonica, for example.
That used to be highly respectable. Gaetano Donizetti scored the mad scene in
the opera Lucia di Lammermoor for demented coloratura (that's not an oxymoron,
MYVAX::ROBERUC!) and glass harmonica. The definitive recording, sung by Beverly
Sills and Carlo Bergonzi under the baton of Julius Rudel, features the acknow-
ledged master, Bruno Hoffman, playing the glass harmonica, and damned eerie
it sounds, too. There's a very nice glass harmonica to be seen at Barrett
House in New Ipswich, New Hampshire. We once visited the place and I later
sent the lady of the house a tape of the glass harmonica to play for later
visitors.

 According to a story in the latest "PC MAgazine", an expert system developed
by Rand Corporation  to help military leaders use computers to simulate
international conflicts generally kept concluding that escalation into war
was irrational.  The Pentagon ordered Rand to change the system to declare
war more often.

Subj:   OED to be published on CD-ROM - Now if we could just read it...

Oxford University Press has announced that early in 1988
it will publish the original Oxford English Dictionary,
1884-1928, issued in twelve printed volumes, on two CD ROM disks.

OUP states that this product is very user-friendly, much more so
than other similar products on the market.

These CD ROMs can run on a PC, XT or AT or an IBM clone with
a 640 K memory with either a CGA or EGA device.  A Hitachi,
Philips, or Sony disk drive is required.  The display monitor
may be monochrome, but a colour monitor is preferable, as colour
is used to distinguish different types of information.

OUP also plan to make the original OED available on magnetic tape
in a fully structured version with embedded codes, written in IBM
format.

In 1989, OUP will publish the Oxford English Dictionary, Second
Edition, which is the text of the original OED, plus supplements,
plus new material which has been added recently.  This will be
published in a printed version of 20 volumes.

The database containing this material will be made available in a
number of electronic forms.

COMPUTER PROGRAM DRIVES ARAB TO SEXUAL EXHAUSTION

A Saudi Arabian millionaire thought he was heading for conjugal bliss when he
had the bright idea of organising his harem by computer.
  Unfortunately his plan misfired.  Instead of leaving him with the satisfied
smile of a clever Cassanova, Saleh-el-Modiia's rigorous regime left him
completely knackered.  A fact which one of his four wives tearfully related to
a newspaper in the Saudi city of Riyadh.
  "The computer has gone haywire.  It's making Saleh too exhausted...  he just
falls asleep in my arms", she said.
  The computer devised a weekly schedule for the 38-year-old failed Lothario
after he had keyed in his wives' ages, birthdays, clothes sizes and medical
details.  The schedule told him who to go to see, what to wear, and what he
was meant to do.
  But even though Modiia's wives are complaining, he refuses to ditch the
computer.  "It's only gone wrong once.  That was when I was in hospital and
all four wives came to visit me at the same time", he said.

Subj:   chili

A couple of years ago (maybe even 3 or 4) Desperado ran a series on chili
recipies.  Unfortunately, I did not save it.  Is there a chance on getting
some new activity on this most mouth-watering, inflammatory subject?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well? Has any old Desperad' with advanced pack rat instincts still got the in-
terminable series that Tom once did on chili recipes cluttering up her disk? I
pointed Ben at Geoff Stern's food files, but he's still not satisfied.

You help him, I'm flying South for the winter.
