                    -&gt; WARNING! MUSICAL REFERENCES AHEAD!&lt;-
Well. You shoulda been there. If you were there, of course, ignore, but I just
wanted to fill in the rest of the rowdy crowd. The Spit Brook Singers just
put on their fifth annual Holiday Concert, complete with bells, whistles,
brass, and top brass at that! The Spittunes, as they are affectionately and
familiarly known, wanted to make a big splash for their fifth anniversary, and
we drafted what is usually known as a "pickup orchestra" from among the
faithful here at ZK. They persisted in calling themselves the ZKOrchestra,
but we invariably called them the Spit Valves. (Little musical joke, there.)
I ask you to imagine Handel performed by Klezmorim, because when the second
clarinet is taking the viola part, that's what you get. It was the most
raucous, joyous Messiah chorus I've ever sung! And who was sitting in the
front row with a tolerant smile on his benevolent face? Who else but Ursa
Major, visiting ZK with the executive committee for a major woods meeting!

We also performed a short, nasty, funny little number called "The Twelve
Days After Christmas". Without further ado, observe the action of this
song upon an impressionable school board:

This was in the Boston Globe, Friday, December 18, 1987:

                Christmas parody vetoed at Vt. school

    COLCHESTER, Vt. -- Ho ho ho, the answer is no.
       The Colchester High School chorus planned to sing a parody of
    a Christmas carol at a concert last night, but the school's
    superintendent vetoed it.
       The song is called "The Twelve Days After Christmas."  It includes
    descriptions of the destruction and return of gifts received during
    the 12 days following Christmas.
       The first line is, "The first day after Christmas, my true love and
    I had a fight, and so I chopped the pear tree down and burned it just
    for spite."
       A parent complained that the song was offensive, and superintendent
    Richard Grimley agreed.
       "I felt there is so much we could be doing in tune with the season,"
    Grimley said.  "I'd hate to feel we'd be presenting something that
    would be offensive to some."
        Grimley overturned a decision by the school's complaint committee
    to allow the song to go on.  The committee is made up of principal
    John Willard, the school librarian, and two teachers appointed by
    Grimley.
        They attended a rehearsal and decided the song should stay in the
    program.  The students have been practicing the concert's five songs
    for two months.
        Students and parents argued that the song is written and performed
    humorously and is not meant to be offensive.
        "It's not the most gentle piece, but it's not harmful," said chorus
    president Caitlin Caroll, 17.  The song has been performed at other
    schools, she said.  "It's always been quite a laugh," the senior added.

I think this is a plant, however. Superintendent GRIMLEY? Caitlin CAROLL?
Give me a break! However, I hope you noted the redoutable Miss Eppes'
personal name? So did Andy Kenah:

VOYAGE OF THE ROCK ALIENS
  starring Pia Zadora

  as the promo says:
   A guitar-shaped spaceship streaks through the skies in search of the
   origins of rock n' roll and lands in the town of "Speelburgh," U.S.A.
   Led by Absid, the alien crew is just in time to play at Heidi High's
   [say that fast three times] school dance on Saturday night.  Frankie
   and his band of bullies, the Pack, are not too eager to share the stage
   and a battle of the bands breaks out!
   It's galactic laughter and cosmic chaos as Dee Dee, Frankie's girl-
   friend [[Frankie and Dee Dee?? There are some of us who remember this
   from the first time around]], pursues a singing career with the alien
   rockers, Absid pursues a close encounter with Dee Dee, "Chainsaw"
   pursues a well-tuned tool and the sheriff is in hot pursuit of the
   musical invaders.  Beam yourself aboard for the funnest, most enter-
   taining music comedy ever launched.

    It's late,  I'm tired,  I'm drunk,  and I don't speak French.  But
    what the hell, its worth a shot.

    &gt;Avec mon petit bonhomme d'amoureux, tant que j'ai ete apprentie,
    &gt;je l'ai laisse payer lorsqu'il me precisait (avant le repas) qu'il
    &gt;m'invitait, et j'ai veille a pouvoir payer ma part dans les autres
    &gt;cas. En fait, durant cette epoque, me sachant dans une position
    &gt;financiere difficile, il a presque toujours paye nos repas au
    &gt;restaurant (restaurants qui n'etaient jamais de luxe, loin de la !)

        With my little boyfriend I have an apartment.  I laid around the
        pool until I got an invitation to buy some used auto parts. In
        fact during the last few weeks when I was in financial difficulties
        I got presents for not going to a restaurant ( the kind of deluxe
        restaurants where the waiters wear pajama tops and loin cloths!)

    &gt;A present que je suis employee, je gagne presqu'autant que lui.
    &gt;Par consequent, nous nous invitons mutuellement. Comme j'ai moins
    &gt;de charges que lui (pas de voiture, un loyer minuscule, etc), je
    &gt;me charge des repas de fetes, des huitres et du champagne, et je le
    &gt;laisse payer les pizzas, les entrecotes et les crepes. Je l'aime.

        I got a present from a fellow employee whose  name is Louie.
        As a consequence I got invited to buy Mutual funds.  I also
        got a lot of charge cards from Louie (without paying except
        for a miniscule lawyer's fee) and I charged up a feast with
        champagne and pizzas and trenchcoats and crepes. I was hungry.

    &gt;Mais j'aime bien me faire inviter, et qu'on fasse des folies pour
    &gt;moi... jamais je ne me suis reveillee avec une pleine baignoire
    &gt;de roses rouges a mes cotes !

        Maybe I wasn't  being fair by not inviting fools to my feast...
        I like to wake up in the morning with a plain black bag full
        of red roses and a coyote.

I collect travel EMPTY travel sickness bags, to date I have 59 different
types - excluding duplicates, some have been signed by celebrities such
as Terrance Trent D'Arby others have been signed by cabin crews.

I imagine many readers, their friends and families travel frequently
and therefore have the opportunity to pick up these little beauties
signed or otherwise. If the bag is plain or does not state the name
of the carrier, I would appreciate a boarding card or other proof of
travel.

My objectives are, firstly to get my name in the Guinness Book of Records
and secondly I will auction the collection for a charity.

Speaking of Lawyers --

Question: Why are more and more laboratories switching from rats to
          lawyers as experimental animals?

Answer: (1) There are more lawyers than rats
        (2) The lab personnel don't get emotionally attached to lawyers
        (3) Lawyers will do things even RATS won't do

Introduction:

"This is part of an occasional series of stories about the literacy problem on
Cape Cod."

I wonder if it would work on things other than illiteracy? Imagine all the
adult incompetence at your site compacted into little plastic bags and left by
the curb beside the remains of the Christmas turkey! Cubes of adult impure
thoughts next to cubes of banana skins. Good and evil and apple pie.

We would need an environmental impact statement. The stuff is probably
recycleable, but we wouldn't want to. It would be a disaster if it started
contaminating our ground-water supply. Would dumping in the ocean in a
subduction zone be preferable to long-term burial in salt domes?

                NEW STUFFING PLANT FOR THE HOME GARDEN
            by Warren Schultz - National Gardening Dec '87

     "The state of stuffing today is a shame, "admits  stuffing  plant
breeder  Dr.   A.   A.   Crewton  of  Agri-Technoid Industries.  "Most
people think stuffing is stuffing," he says.  "But they obviously have
never  had  a  good  cultivar  of  it picked fresh from the garden.  I
wouldn't eat the stuff  they  sell  in  the  store."  He  thinks  most
gardeners  would  agree  if  they had a chance to grow their own.  But
until now, finding that good variety presented a problem.

     There are plenty of reasons why stuffing hasn't caught  on  as  a
garden  crop,  says  Crewton.   Specialized  equipment  is required to
separate the stuffing kernels from the spiny pods in which they  grow.
The  plant  also requires a lot of space, and though breeding work has
increased its yield, new varieties are bred for the commercial  trade,
not  the  home  gardener.   "Storability, shippability, yield, uniform
cubes and disease resistance are the traits  of  the  new  varieties,"
says  Crewton.   What  about  flavor?  "Taste has been bred right out.
You might as well be eating cardboard,"  he  says.   Today's  stuffing
farmers  pick the crop before it's fully matured and dry, and allow it
to ripen up in the box or bag.  "But  you  never  get  the  full,  old
fashioned taste that way," Crewton explains.

     Stuffing, of course, is one  of  the  few  crops  native  to  the
Parsippany,  New  Jersey,  area.   And  though  it was brought back to
Europe by Christopher Columbus, it remained just a curiosity there and
in  North America.  For centuries eating stuffing was thought to cause
delirium and even death.  It was said  that  those  who  ate  it  were
immediately  afflicted  with an overwhelming desire to collapse into a
chair  and  watch  violent  sports  until  their  eyes  glazed   over.
Shakespeare spoke for all of Europe when he wrote in Macbeth, "Cleanse
the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff/Which  weight  heavy  on  the
heart."

     However, in 1880, the Reverend Crenshaw Dressage  hauled  a  full
bushel  of  stuffing  up  the steps of the Goshenhoppen, Pennsylvania,
post office, and with at least a half dozen people watching,  devoured
the  entire  bushelful.   The American stuffing industry was born that
day.

     Dr.  Crewton expects that his work will have just as much  effect
in regenerating the state of stuffing in America.  He has discovered a
wild, hull-less stuffing plant, which he's  crossed  with  the  common
stuffing.  The result:  a new cultivar that's dwarf, early, hull-less,
spineless, and can dry right on the stalk to develop full flavor.   It
also  has  resistance to soggy bottom disease and phytofragga crumble.
"And it's pretty enough to  be  included  in  any  edible  landscape,"
Crewton says.

     A single plant can fill a small  turkey  or  several  large  rock
Cornish  game  hens.   With 60 days to maturity, you no linger have to
wait until November or December to harvest.  "Gardeners will be eating
stuffing  on  the Fourth of July," he predicts.  And the flavor?  "You
don't have to smother it with gravy," he says.  "It's good  enough  to
eat straight from the stalk."

     It's not a perfect plant yet, the breeder admits.  Though insects
have shown no interest in it, birds can wipe out the crop.  For now he
recommends covering the plants  with  bird  netting  or  floating  row
covers.   But  he's  hard at work on another solution.  "Gene splicing
offers some  fascinating  possibilities,"  he  says.   He's  had  some
success  crossing  the stuffer with rutabaga, but two problems remain.
"Growing underground, the birds can't get it, "he says, "but the  mice
just  about  cleaned  us out.  And what was left wound up tasting like
rutabagas."

     Dr.  Crewton has  just  released  his  germplasm  to  minor  seed
companies  but  seeds will not be available to the home gardener for a
long, long time.

Subj:   Waiter, there's a wombat in my phone...

       Reference: "Dial-A-Wombat leaves police 'up a tree'",
   NEWCASTLE MORNING HERALD, WSW Australia, p. 1, 27 Aug 1980.

       First there was Dial-A-Prayer, then Dial-A-Recipe, and even
   Dial-A-Footballer.  But the south-east Victorian town of Sale has
   produced one to top them all. Dial-A-Wombat.

       It all began early yesterday when Sale police received a telephone
   call:  "You won't believe this, and I'm not drunk, but there's a wombat
   in the phone booth outside the town hall," the caller said.

       Not firmly convinced about the caller's claim to sobriety, members
   of the constabulary drove to the scene, expecting to pick up a drunk.

       But there it was, an annoyed wombat, trapped in a telephone booth.

       The wombat, determined not to be had the better of again, threw
   its bulk into the fray.  It was eventually lassoed and released in a
   nearby scrub.

       Then the officers received another message...another wombat in
   another phone booth.

       There it was:  *Another* angry wombat trapped in a telephone booth.

       The constables took the miffed marsupial into temporary custody
   and released it, too, in the scrub.

       But on their way back to the station they happened to pass another
   telephone booth, and - you guessed it - another imprisoned wombat.

       After some serious detective work, the lads in blue found a
   suspect, and after questioning, released him to be charged on summons.

       Their problem...they cannot find a law against placing wombats in
   telephone booths.

Subj:   Amusing quotations from the VMS Internals and Data Structures book.

A few years ago, I sent out a list of amusing quotations from the
VMS Internals and Data Structures book.  Recently, there is a new
version of this book, for VMS V4.4.  I thought you might enjoy seeing
the new list of quotations which introduce each chapter.  Here is the
title of each chapter and the quote found in the VMS Internals
and Data Structures book (I have my favorites, I hope you find some of
them as interesting as I did...):

 o   Scheduling

        It is equally bad when one speeds on the guest unwilling to go,

 o   Image Activation and Termination

        I would have you imagine, then, that there exists in the mind of
        man a block of wax...  and that we remember and know what is

 o  Logical Names

Subj:   A Digital Christmas Story or.... a case study on aggressive behavior

                     A Christmas Story

                            or

        Fun Times Whilst Travelling on Company Business

This is a true story. Only the names have been omitted to protect
the guilty and the stupid. It is your task to differentiate.

I was on an airplane coming back to the US for my son's birthday. Because
of the Digital travel person's spiel about how we get automatic upgrades
and special prices etc for flying with them, I chose an airline that I
dislike intensely.  All rubbish.  The morning of the flight I knew I
didn't want to get on THAT plane. I was late to begin with and then went to
the wrong terminal (futilely hoping to miss the flight, I suspect). I
boarded the plane during the final stages of the sardine packing operation
in Economy Class (the sacrifices I have made for this Company).  I was put
in the center of the middle row near the wings facing a wall. There were
largish men with briefcases on either side of me.

The flight was uneventful and unpleasant.  We were 90 seconds or
so from landing and were making our final approach over land before
crossing the water to the airport.  The man on my right had not
stowed his briefcase under his seat and for some unknown reason
this fact annoyed me greatly.  Showing great restraint, I
refrained from taking him to task about it.  Instead, I focussed
my attention out the window to my left and watched as large pieces
of metal started flying off the airplane's wing.  There was a bang
in the rear of the plane which I assume was one of these flying
objects striking another part of the plane. There were no announcements
and the plane kept on approaching the water.

(Oh joy, swimming in December!  Where do they keep the life preservers?)

I looked to where the over-the-wing exits should be on the 747 and noted
that this airline had, in a spate of greed, sealed them over so they could
put in extra seats.  Expletive deleted.

Adrenaline pumping, I turned to my companion with the briefcase on his lap
and said tersely:  "Put that briefcase under your seat NOW! We've lost part
of our wing and we may crash."  He looked at me dumbly as I grabbed his case
and stowed it.  When we landed he began to speak to me rapidly in a language
I had never heard before!

As the pilot announced instructions to the passengers who would be continuing
on to Philadelphia, several passengers tried to convince the flight attendants
that the plane was minus some major parts of its left wing.  The next day the
Boston Globe reported on a disgruntled doctor attending a family party in
Revere who discovered his silver Mercedes sporting some unwanted, used
airplane parts which he reckoned would not enhance either its value or road
performance.

I told my surprised family how very lucky they were to have me home for
Christmas.  So much for boring European business trips.

Subj:   New scientific breakthrough! Something good is not *all* bad...

"Chocolate's Role in Cavity Prevention"
  from Insight Magazine, Dec 14 1987 issue.
  [typos, spellos, and comments in brackets are mine.]

Indulging in some forms of chocolate may help prevent cavities, not
promote them.  So argue researchers at the Uinversity of Texas Health
Science Center, who hope that a two-year study will enable them to
pinpoint and extract the ingredient that might act as a cavity
deterrent.

Preliminary evidence, including a 1960's study in shich  hamsters fed
cocoa developed fewer cavities and a later study of adolescents dieting
largely on chocolate skim milk [ no kidding -- they really said that.]
who had less dental plaque than people on a normal diet, has led
researchers to speculate that an ingredient in cocoa inhibits the enzyme
that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose.  Glucose forms
plaque on the tooth surface and fructose ferments to a tooth-decaying
acid.

"We first have to isolate the inhibitor substance in cocoa, work out its
properties and then purify the extract," says Alan D. Elbein, a
professor of biochemistry at the university's San Antonio campus.  "Then
if we find that it does indeed prevent cavities, the next step is to
chemically synthesize this substance.  But right now, we have no idea
how much would be needed or how easy the extraction process will be."
Elbein and the colleagues will analyze both the whole cacao bean and the
beans' fine, brown powder.

      As an engineer doing performance analysis, and the recipient of a
      new puppy (not asked for), I have determined that doggies, like
      computers, can be somewhat programmable (although they will continue,
      like computers, to behave in somewhat erratic, unexplainable ways).
      I have come up with a first cut at explaining doggie behavior through
      DOGGEN (pronounced DOG JEN, like VMS SYSGEN) parameters.

        BARK_VOLUME - The volume (in decibles) the doggie barks at.
                     The minimum BARK_VOLUME is equivalent to standing
                     three feet away from a Boeing 747 with all engines set
                     to maximum warp speed.  This is a dynamic parameter, and
                     is automatically raised at night.

        SLEEP_TIME - This parameter is the maximum number of sequential hours
                     doggie masters are allowed to sleep.

        WHO_JUMP_## - These parameters are a set of ASCII strings (fixed) such
                     that the doggie knows only to jump on those who are small
                     or compromised.  Infants and people with canes, for
                     instance, are always included on this list.

        FURNITURE_CHEW - This dynamic boolean parameter is true if the doggie
                     thinks it is allowed to chew furniture.  You can boot the
                     doggie to reset it to 0, but as a dynamic parameter you
                     can't be sure that it will stay that way.

        SPAYED     - This boolean parameter is always false at female doggie
                     initialization, but can be changed to true any time after
                     first heat.  After set to true, this parameter can never
                     be set back to false.

        WET_SMELL  - This dynamic parameter is representative of the doggie's
                     triggering of the olfactory sense in humans.  Related
                     to LIFE sysgen parameters IS_WET, RAINING, RIVER, etc.

        EMPTY_CRANIUM - This boolean parameter is typically set to true if the
                     dog belongs to you.  If it is someone else's dog, this
                     parameter is set to false, leading doggie owners into
                     doggie_food_is_greener_on_the_other_side syndrome.

Note 135.30            They Bounce Terminals, Don't They?               30 of 38
EAGLE1::LEONARD "VAX Architecture Management"        31 lines   1-DEC-1987 12:15
                                -&lt; Key gurgle &gt;-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My '52 had a copier that worked when the paper was fresh, but I never used it.
It also had the serrated edge designed for tearing the paper off, but actually
used more frequently for slashing my wrist.  I must have torn myself on that
thing ten times in five years.  Even so, I loved that terminal.

Of course, mine was slightly modified.  I hadn't had it very long when a mail
truck rumbling down the hall jiggled the floor enough to knock a coffee cup
over on the top of the terminal.  The coffee all poured through the ventilation
slots and into the guts, of course.  I turned the terminal off and waited for
it to dry, then turned it back on and discovered that it still worked, but that
the key click had disappeared!  Since I can't stand key click, I was thrilled,
and even more thrilled when it didn't come back.  So I was careful not to turn
the terminal over to field service, who might have "fixed" it.

Unfortunately, about two years later I overwatered a plant I'd hung directly
over the terminal, and the overflow splashed down into the back.  It evidently
cleaned the coffee off or something, because it brought the key click back.  So
I turned the terminal off (no sense tempting fate) and poured some coffee down
in back, and sure enough, the key click disappeared again.  I shoulda been a
engineer.

As to the little shelf, I used mine mostly to hold my nickel, since I often had
to change line speeds.  But I found that rather than tipping the terminal up on
its tush, it was easier to pull it toward me until the switches cleared the
edge of the desk, and then reach underneath and do it blind.  Of course, I had
to mentally invert the switch settings, but I pretty soon had the inverted
settings memorized.  Made for real confusion when I worked on a '52 on its
back.

Ah, the '52 -- the only terminal that could grind its gears.  They just don't
make 'em like that any more.
