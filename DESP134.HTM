I trust everybody made it through Hurricane Gloria in one, or, at most, two
pieces. The real big wind was the media treatment of the storm. Wally and
I watched Channel 5 working themselves up into a froth, and when the hurricane
actually hit us, it was an anticlimax. True, we were without power for 30
hours, but hey, fortunes of war. The entertaining part was watching the
eye of the hurricane pass over us, in Brookline NH. Everything got still,
you could see patches of blue sky, and then the wind started blowing in the
other direction. Let me know how you fared, and how you feel about TV news
making more noise than the storm.

I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but I had my first net NOTES experience
only a couple of weeks ago. You may recall that last time, in this space,
I asked about the putative reunion of Steely Dan. My dear husband suggested
that I try the notes file on Easynet, EXIT26""::SYS$NOTES:MUSIC. I revved up my
terminal and gave it a shot, and by George, there was an entry and a
bunch of responses on Steely Dan! I could see how it could become addictive,
but I mention all this only because within a day or two of my epiphany,
the following article wafted its way across the wires. It's long, true,
but delightful. Take it away, SYBIL::EPPES!

Subj:   The wisdom of the net

[Reprinted from IEEE Spectrum, September 1985, p. 8, without permission.]

                          The wisdom of the net

Has your computer spoken to mine lately?  Mine seems to have a lot of
friends out there.  All day and all night long I imagine that I hear the
steady buzzing and whispering as messages are passed back and forth over
Usenet.  Although the messages are intended for anyone, I am a little
embarrassed to admit that sometimes I browse among them.  At their best
these evolving computer networks represent a new social phenomenon, full of
information, wit, and wisdom.  At their worst they show the dark side of our
associates -- the all-too-human intolerances that we sometimes feel our
profession has outgrown.  Somewhere in the middle, between the wisdom and
the sludge, is a growing pollution of junk bits, threatening to cover the
surface of the earth with used disks full of unread messages.

  In case you haven't partaken, the rules of networking are simple.  There are
several hundred subjects available on the net -- net.consumers to exchange
consumer information, net.philosophy to discuss philosophy, net.movies for
general movie gossip, and net.movies.sw to discuss the Star Wars saga, to
name a few examples.  Anyone who is reached by the tentacles of Usenet can
insert or read news under any category.  These tentacles reach far and wide
in mysterious ways across several continents.  No one seems to run the net;
as far as I can tell, it just grew itself, and is administered by the
collective will of all who tinker with it.  I was surprised to find that my
own computer was acting as a main hub to relay messages to Europe.
Presumably it assumed this role on its own because when all the old
telephone bills came to light, no human being seemed culpable.

  People on the net use their own names, but sometimes I get suspicious
about their affiliations.  The society of "Chartered Accountants Who Want
To Be Lion Tamers" sounded phony to me.  On the other hand, many users with
real affiliations take special precautions to distance themselves from their
employers.  Witness the following sign-offs:

  "I suspect that [name of university] would deny knowing me, let alone
share my views."

  "The opinions expressed herein are randomly generated by my keyboard, and
probably do not reflect the opinions of the university...which are also
randomly generated by my keyboard."

  "This may not reflect my opinion, let alone anyone else's."

  "The [government agency] is paying me to post this message, but if I am
caught they will disavow all knowledge of my actions."

  Others insert a tag line with a bit of philosophy, such as:

  "It's the thought, if any, that counts."

  "I've had a great many troubles in my time, and most of them never
happened."

  "I'm an engineer; I don't have to read."

  "If things don't change, they will probably remain the same."

  Usenet is best at collecting opinions and information about specific
technical matters.  The request "Does anyone out there have any advice about
graphic boards for an IBM PC?" will never fail to draw generous responses
full of useful information.  The net is at its most interesting when a
particular topic goes supernova and generates hundreds of opinions before it
burns out.  For example, in net.movies the question debated was "What was
the worst movie of all time?"  The most popular answer seemed to be "Attack
of the Killer Tomatoes."  But the net is far from representing an average
slice of the population.  Walter Mondale won the network poll for the U.S.
presidential election handily.  The movie "Somewhere in Time" got (I
thought) terrible reviews in the press, but netters were fascinated by the
concept of time travel and were passionate in their defense of the movie.
There was one exception, though, from a respondent who, after reading all
the praise on the net, had raced out to rent the movie.  "This movie was
baaaaad," he wrote, "so bad that even my dog had to leave the room!"

  I was particularly interested in several debates on net.consumers.
Someone asked if anyone else had a particular electric socket in the house
where light bulbs seemed to burn out more rapidly than elsewhere.  There was
an astonishing outpouring of discussion about the economics of long-life
bulbs, the relative mechanical stresses on filaments hung upside down, and
the light-versus-power efficiencies of various methods of illumination.  It
typically happens that an expert in the particular subject will join the
discussion at an early point and give an authoritative answer brimming with
expertise that would appear to end the matter then and there.  However, at
first timidly and later in a deluge, mere people refute the expert, who is
often characterized as having learned this stuff from a book and having no
practical experience of the way things really work.  Another fascinating
discussion ensued when someone naively asked why pilot lights go out.  It
really had never occurred to me.  After all, everyone knows that pilot
lights go out, but I hadn't the faintest notion why.  (I'm still trying to
figure out why rain doesn't come down my chimney.)  Anyway, someone from the
gas company claimed pilot lights going out was never their fault, and the
networking battle was joined.

  The most infamous discussion group is net.flame, whose motto is "Don't
argue over anything that can be settled with a flamethrower."  It is said
that one of the software architects intended net.flame for catharsis; it is
used for venting steam over any complaint or perceived injustice.  As one
user explained the tone of a previous exchange:  "The discussion was
conducted in net.flame, where logic and civility are outlawed."  Some
entries are isolated cries into the night, such as one person's complaint
about actors pretending to play instruments:  "Then there are
pseudoconductors pseudoconducting a pseudoorchestra, but after all we live
in a country where Liberace can give concerts and not be put to death."

  On other occasions hundreds of people will chime in to echo a complaint,
as when someone wrote how much he disliked the "twits" at a particular
fast-food chain who always insisted on asking him if he wouldn't like cheese
on his hamburger or didn't he mean to order fries too, or some such
order-expanding suggestion.  (One solution that was proposed:  every time
such a question is asked, remove some item of food from the order.  Another
user offered a fantasy of Clint Eastwood staring silently at the offending
salesperson until the original order was filled.)  Another popular complaint
centered around junk mail that displays the words "You may have already
won..." on the envelope.  I'm sure you get the idea.

  I personally have learned a lot from the wisdom of the net.  In addition
to all kinds of valuable computer advice, I've learned how to protect my car
stereo from theft with a small thermonuclear device.  (One must add a
prominent sticker reading:  "If you decide to steal my car or any of its
contents, please don't take my expensive and hard-to-replace stereo unit
located to the right of that small nuclear device...")  I am fascinated by
the question of whether a new form of social interaction is in the making,
or whether the phenomenon is just passing through an interesting, useful
phase on its way to oblivion as thousands of new subscribers increase the
noise and junk level until nothing but echoes of what-might-have-been
remain.

Subj:   mouse-ing more but enjoying it less?

(much forwarded, originating in Australia, but very enjoyable)

Someone here has just been diagnosed as suffering from RSI (Is this term
in use outside Australia?) which he has got from using a Macintosh Mouse.
He's a dedicated Mac user of some 12 months and is now in a position
where he isn't supposed to do anything with his right hand for a couple
of weeks.  He just returned from physiotherapy where they had his hand
in ice for half an hour.

This is the first case on this campus of anyone getting tenosynivitis
from a mouse and I was wondering if anyone else has come across similar
instances elsewhere or knew of any research dealing specifically
with mouse RSI?

In any case, this should serve as a WARNING that mice can be as
hazardous to health as any keyboard.

Subj:   Trivia

I noticed that most of last month's trivia questions were answered. I
thought I would wait to see how many people answered. I was surprised that
no one had an answer for the 11/74.

I believe that there are 2 11/74 "systems" running. One system, made up of 4
cpu's is in Spitbrook, the other is with a customer in Canada. The way I
understand it, the customer was an 11/74 field test site, and liked the
system so much, would not give it back.

Trivia question and answer's;

1.      What was the code name for the VAX 780?

ans;    STAR

2.      Where was the "secret" (until the Boston Globe found out) VAX proto
        training held?

ans:    88 Restaurant,  (Now the Manor IV)

3.      Who was the first 780 customer (non DEC)?

ans.    The first 2 systems built were for internal DEC product lines.
        The third one was for "Bell Telephone". Shipped 2/24/78.

Subj:   More on the PDP-11 trivia...

        Some more on the PDP-11 trivia questions:
        From John Ellis:

   *A*  "PDS" stands for "Programmable Data System", a little tiny
   *A*  computer (from IPG -- the Industrial Product Group, I believe),
   *A*  meant for dedicated tasks on the shop floor.

No, I think Jeremy Barker had the name right (Program Development System),
and as far as what the product actually was: it was the default CLI under IAS.
(Anyone remember how you booted IAS??)

   *A*     What was the original memory limit in RSX-11M?
   *A*     What limited RSX-11M to that memory ceiling?

I'd have to guess 28KW for the system and 4K for the I/O page; probably due
to not having any memory management support OR because of it's being possible
to run it on a machine that didn't have the MM hardware; or a combination of
both.

   *A*   - What was the name of the ruggedized (Norden) version
   *A*     of the PDP-11/20?

I *think* it was called the "RUGGED-11", but I do remember from its poster that
it was the UGLIEST looking thing I'd ever seen at the time, with those large
steel-handled toggle switches and the imposing metal case it came in... seems I
remember someone in the area where I saw the poster (Unibus Engineering on 5-5?)
commenting that the thing was tough enough to be dropped out of an airplane
(but I still wonder if he meant 'without a parachute' ??)

And, from Jeremy Barker:

&gt; Are there any 11/74's outside of the RSX lab (in customer's
&gt; possession, I mean).    In fact, are there any left inside DEC?

CASTOR/POLLUX was supposed to be an 11/74, at one time I heard it was a 4-CPU
machine (I haven't seen the thing in ages, is CASTOR still coupled to another
machine?). And, in Tewksbury, ELROND is a dual 11/74, still in the original
package (I guess). What a shame, that the project was cancelled the same day
that the hardware was released to LR... anyone care to comment WHY??
        I also have heard that some of the re-designed RH70's actually got
sold to some customers, as one of them called in one day and said, "My RH-
70C broke down, have you got any replacement parts?" , and the response was
something like, "RH70- C????? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT???"

&gt; What was the 11/50?   The 11/T55?

        11T55(sic) = 11/45 with 32K Fastbus bipolar memory in a packaged
                     system in 2 cabinets with 2 RK05s. Software included
                     was RSX11M and FORTRAN IV-Plus

Close, but you forgot one important piece: the FP11-C Floating-Point Processor
(the first thing I ever worked on in Engineering). With the FP11-C, the 11T55
was supposed to be able to run rings around a LOT of larger,faster FORTRAN
machines on some (at the time) important benchmarks (like Whetstone, etc.). We
even took out a 2-page color ad in the Sunday Globe (?) when it was announced,
the engineers had it posted on the wall outside the lab.

        Funny, but the thing that I miss the most about these machines is
the lights on the consoles. Now can we have another trivia session and see who
can remember what the patterns in the lights looked like for each operating
system?

Subj:   11 trivia

The "eleven-thirty" was my first computer too.   The 1130 was made by IBM.
What was your configuration?   Mine had 8Kw of memory (later expanded to the an
unheard of 16Kw).   The disk looked like the RK05 cartridge, but I remember it
holding much less.   The 1130 was a batch system.   FORTRAN was the main
programming language, COBOL and RPG were available later.   The instruction set
was RISC. If I had to describe it in DEC terms, it would be a PDP-8 with 16-bit
addresses.   Memory was word addressable only, and bits were numbered (unlike
other IBM machines) ala PDP11 (the least significant bit was bit 0)...

We had a plotter too, and eventually replaced the 1132 printer with a 1403
(still, in my consideration, the only "real" printer ever made.)   The 1403
channel adaptor was as large as the CPU box.  The card reader was rather unique
(I think, anyway, I've never seen anything quite like it).   It was a reader-
punch, and in the card only system, the second pass would punch the intermediate
pass info *into the first 20 or so columns of your original source deck*.

The 1130 O/S was my first exposure to "operating systems".   By the time I
was done, I had modified most of it - typical college hacker.   Somehow or
other, we got the microfiche, and I *manually* keypunched the changes into
80-column cards, and reassembled the affected pieces.   You could get away
that in those days when the system you "booted" was yours.

The 1130 had something else that I liked - real switches.   We actually
had the gaul to write code that based its behaviour on the setting of
console switches.   The RPG-II language (which was the System-3 follow
on to the 1130's just RPG) actually implemented "virtual switches"
for this reason.

I know of other 1130 machines (one at a college in Sioux Falls, SD whose name
escapes me) that was diskless - it had only the card reader, and I think, 4Kw of
memory.   The only language available was assembler.

By the way, what was the 1130's (big) sister machine?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The gaul to write code for console switches? Why do I picture a programmer
dressed in skins with long blond mustaches and a homemade mace bashing
away, quite literally, at the console? Talk about ruggedized!

Subj:   A Can of Corn

     A clipping from the Washington Post contributed by  Geoff  Stern,
     raconteur extraordinaire and gourmet chef:

          In a report on the decline of home  cooking  in  busy,  busy
          America, The Wall Street Journal raises the possibility that
          the term "convenience food" may soon  apply  only  to  those
          things  that  can  be  put  directly  into  one's  mouth  or
          microwave oven.  Everything else is a lot of trouble.

          This is because certain rudimentary kitchen  techniques  are
          not  being  passed from mother to daughter anymore; they are
          not   being   passed   from   mother   to   son   or    from
          spouse-equivalent  to  stepchild  either.   How rudimentary?
          Consider a can of corn.  The  Journal  says  that  when  the
          Pillsbury  Co.  "removed the directions from its can of corn
          (put the corn in a pan on a heated burner)  it  received  so
          many  calls from puzzled consumers that it reinstated them."
          We think those directions are still a little vague,  though.
          How about the following instead?

              Grip can-opener firmly and begin  opening  procedure  as
              described in owner's manual

              Open only one end of can.  Corn will be yellow.

              With single motion, empty product into pan and place  on
              stove.

              Light burner to begin heating procedure.

              Continue until corn is hot.  Consult with friends and/or
              relatives on proper temperature.

              If complications arise, call toll-free number at top  of
              label.  In event of fire dial "911" where applicable.

          "A can of corn" is an old baseball  expression  for  a  play
          that's  so  easy  no one could botch it.  No wonder it isn't
          used much these days.

A man and his wife went out golfing one day.  During the game, the man
shanked a drive into the rough behind a little shack.  He looked left.
He looked right.  There was no easy shot for him to make.  Then his wife
pointed out that if he opened the doors on both sides of the shack, he
would have a clear shot for the green.  The man did so but just as he
shot the ball his wife peeked around the corner and was struck down
dead.  Several years later, the man is golfing the same course with his
new bride.  Again he shanks a drive behind the little shack.  This time
he lines up to poke a little shot back onto the fairway.  As he prepares
to shoot his wife says "Wait Hon, I think if you open these doors you
might have a clear shot at the green!".  The man looks at her and says,
"Forget it!  The last time I did that I took a seven!"

REAGAN MAY THINK HE'S STILL PLAYING IN A MOVIE

A lot has been said about President Reagan's tendency to drift off into a
movieland fantasy-world when discussing major policy issues with aides.
(There was a hilarious Calvin Trillin column on this in The Nation, where
Reagan, meeting with Margaret Thatcher, starts playing "Shane," and she goes
along with him, thinking he's talking about NATO.)  Some people have called
attention to the fact that Reagan frequently refers to movies in his public
statements.  He said, for example, that he had seen "Rambo" and thought that
might be the way to deal with Shi'ites in Beirut.  When he was criticized
about his tax plan, Reagan quoted a line from a recent "Dirty Harry" movie,
"Make my day..."  He quoted "The Bridges at Toko-Ri" at D-Day commemoration
ceremonies in Europe (that must have escaped most in the audience).  And
during a primary debate in New Hampshire in 1980, he said to George Bush,
"I'm paying for this microphone," which was a line from the movie "State of
the Union."  And of course, Reagan's autobiography is called "Where's the
Rest of Me?" which is his famous line from his most critically noted film,
"King's Row."

Now Michael Rogin, a fellow political scientist at Berkeley, has noted the
striking similarity between the Strategic Defense Initiative and one of
Reagan's films called, "Murder in the Air," which was released in 1940.
Reagan played an American secret agent named "Brass Bancroft" who was caught
up in a battle with communist spies.  The striking thing about the film is
that Reagan-Bancroft finally beats out his enemies with the use of a
super-sophisticated space weapon that blasts an enemy spy plane by
"paralyzing electric currents."  The weapon finally makes America invincible
to the treachery of communist air attacks.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
And he has such inexpressibly bad taste in movies...although *King's Row* is
interesting for another reason. A sly FM jock once played the sound track for
*King's Row* immediately following one of John Williams' more self-indulgent
Pops broadcasts, and my dears, the score of *Star Wars* -- or was it *The
Empire Strikes Back*? -- is a straight lift from *King's Row*, down to that
stirring Imperial march. This was a while back, and I don't remember who wrote
the score of *King's Row*, but Williams should be beaten with an old oboe reed
for ripping off a fellow composer.

While we're on the subject, what's the worst movie you ever saw? And
I don't want to hear about sci fi done on a budget of $500 in somebody's
garage. I want to hear about things like Francois Truffaut's *Mississippi
Mermaid*, with Catherine Deneuve...movies made by people who should have
known better, like *Return of the Jedi*. (In case you were wondering, that's
deliberate provocation!)
