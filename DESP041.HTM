               SPECIAL EDITION ON DEC ADVERTISING

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
DEC has recently gone from being low-profile (i.e., unknown and proud
of it) to various attempts at being high profile.  This movement has
gone so far as to bring Ronald Reagan inside one of our buildings.
Even more amazing, Ken Olsen made a speech to marketing and sales
people. (He said of the Reagan visit:  "Well, my mother taught me
always to be polite to guests.")

Desperados have opinions on our advertising campaigns just like they
do on everything else.

A bit of flaming about our advertising:  I agree that our ads
completely lack focus.  (Perhaps we should hire Buster Keaton?)
Visually, thematically, and in every other way, each of our ads is
independent of all of the others.  And we definitely suffer for it.
However, at this point I think we should all be more amazed that we
have ads at all, rather than that they aren't terribly good.

A year or two ago, a typical computer publication would have, say, 20
ads for DEC add-ons and NO ads for DEC itself.

At any rate, there's a point to all this rambling.  Does anyone out
there in Desperado-land know where we could send our feedback and
suggestions for the ad campaign?  Or even if such a place/person
exists?  I sure as hell could tell them a few things.

P.S.  My wife's reaction to the Pro-300 ad with the surgeon:  "A
flashy ad, but it gives the impression that only sophisticated
professionals would have the ability to deal with such an advanced
system."

If Digital is going to win in the market place, we must explore and exploit
marketing channels previously overlooked by our competitors as well as those
used by our competition.

Sears, Computerland and other such outlets are already being exploited, and we
should pursue those channels, but one major American institution has been
grossly overlooked that could put our systems into the minds, and homes, of
every American.  This institution is called McDonalds.

McDonald's already has outlets in every major, and many not so
major, cities in the US and Canada, and also has international outlets.
McDonald's has been diversifying its offerings from the standard fare to
include fried chicken, barbecued spare ribs, breakfast items, etc.

It is a logical progression from the McChicken(tm) sandwich,
Chicken McNuggets(tm), Egg McMuffin(tm) and Barbecued McRibs(tm)
to Floppy McDisks(tm), Floating Point McProcessor(tm), Color McMonitor(tm),
McApplications(tm) and other McOptions(tm).

Of course with the competition that IBM would give us through Burger
King(tm) with their advertising gimmicks (The Duchess of Downtime, the
Prince of Programs and the Swordsmen of Software), we would have to
come up with a way to teach Ronald McDonald(tm) to sell small business
systems, but he seems to be able to sell anything else by the
billions, so I doubt that will create any problems.

Subject: PRESIDENT REAGAN VISIT -- NEWS UPDATE

        Latest word on Reagan's visit is that Ken will demo the Pro-350
for the president tomorrow.  Of course, there is no guarentee as to what will
really happen because the White House wants to review the specifics of the
set up just before the President arrives.

        There is a possibility that they will give a DECMATE to the White
House in addition.  I assume the choice of DECMATE II is because DIGITAL is
currently trying to make an office automation sale to the White House which
includes DECMATE II'S.

Regards the solicitation of comments on DEC's new ad campaigns:

I sort of agree about the non-impact of the tube-on-the-chair print ad, but
I was quite favorably impressed by the TV ads that have been running on the
NFL playoff games.  I think the slogan they came up with ("...not even the
biggest computer co. gives you all these features -- but the second biggest
does.") is particularly appealing and low-key.  I just wish I knew where
to get all that neat color graphics software.....

There is also a visual pun in one of the newer ads (the one with the
professional sitting in a chair)...a friend of mine asked me if the
chair picture was a DEC(k) chair (and then we recalled that an early
Professional brochure pictured a fellow working in relaxed fashion
on his deck...).

You asked for opinions on the current ad campaigns for the various
DEC personal computers.  From your comments, you haven't seen all of the ads.
I agree that the print ads, and the TV ad with the three guys clapping
suck raw eggs.  But, there's more.

I have seen two additional TV spots, both for the Profesional, which are
slick beyond belief.  They are actually nearly identical, only the profession
involved changes.  The one I got the best look at starts off with an ambulance
arriving at a hospital, where they wheel out this cute kid clutching his
teddy bear, followed by anxious parents.  As the middle-aged doctor starts
surgery, the voice-over says "You're in a business where you can't afford
to make mistakes.  That's why you've worked hard to be the best that you
can be, a professional."  Cutaway to the doc going into his office and
typing at his PC350 - he displays a bar chart labelled "Blood Pressure",
calls up some medical references from a data bank.  "When you choose a personal
computer, you want one as professional as you are.  That's why you've got
the Professional, from Digital Equipment Corporation."  Break to the doc
coming through the door into the waiting room with a smile for the parents -
the kid's gonna live.

The other ad is very similar, but with a lawyer instead of a doctor.  He
calls up legal references, and charts something else I didn't catch.  Both
of these ads have several very good hook-lines:

        "...features that the biggest computer company doesn't give
        you; but the second biggest does."
        "Finally, personal computers have lost their amateur standing."

And the closing tag-line:

        "Computers by professionals for professionals."

When evaluating an ad, you've got to forget about trying to see if the ad
tells you about the product.  Instead, you've got to catch the customer's
interest so she'll go to her phone and call 800-DIGITAL to find out more
about this personal computer that is worthy of her professional standing.
Besides, a computer ad that blurts facts and figures is just boring to
most.

There are three major points I see that DEC is making, successfully, with
these ads.  In descending priority, they are:

        1.  Name recognition.  "Who the heck is Digital?  Don't they
            make watches?"  EVERYBODY has heard of the #1 computer
            company (IBM for those of you who have been asleep for
            200 years) but very few people outside of the computer
            industry (and even many inside it) have never heard of
            DEC.  This is because we've never before sold into a market
            of people who didn't already know what they wanted.  So,
            these ads introduce DEC, and let you know right up front
            that we're no tiny-basement startup company "..the second
            biggest computer company..".

        2.  Ok, so your Digital and we're not.  What next?  Well, now comes
            the product.  Let people see it - it really exists (doesn't it?).
            Get their interest so they say "I'll look into this some more..."

        3.  Differentiate your product from the rest of the apples in
            the barrel, so to speak.  The key phrase here is "Professional" -
            it's in the product name itself, and repeated many times in
            the ads.  The idea here is to portray all the others as just
            kids' toys that strain themselves trying to be business computers.
            DEC's product is designed from the beginning for professional use.

So, these two ads at least are high-class stuff.  The other TV ad and the
print ads, especially the ones which brag about "Blowing the others out of
the market" strikes me as doing more damage than good, as we shouldn't have
to brag like that if we really had a good product.  Next we'll hear about
the Rainbow being named "Motor Trend Computer of the Year".  Yeesh!

On a related subject: At a recent conference in Merrimack, someone asked
Ken what he thought of the current ad campaign.  He said he hated it - but
not because the ads were bad.  He didn't like the campaign because it would
bring customers flocking to the stores, all wanting to buy products we
couldn't deliver or even demonstrate.  Frustrated, they'll see something
else, like Apple or IBM, and buy that instead.

Ken may have a point - I dropped into the DEC store in the Mall of NH last
week and was pleased to see a DECmate II there.  When I mentioned this to
the saleswoman, though, she told me that they only had that demo system for
a week - after that it would be gone and they wouldn't see another for
months.  They have no systems in stock to deliver.  What a way to run a
business!  Independent stores like Computer Town are advertising that
they have Rainbows and Professionals in stock, though.  I haven't checked to
see if it's true.

Finally, the Professional ads on TV aren't the only good ads DEC is doing.
Check out the VAX ads in the last two Computerworlds!  This is a new campaign,
somewhat reminiscent of the successful "Ask Any User" series, where
satisfied customers tell how VAX made the big difference in their product.
The first one, featuring Computer Graphics Laboratory, Inc., tells how
the real-time performance of VAX makes it easy to do computer animation.  They
include a sequence from what I suppose would be a LifeSavers ad - very nice.
The artwork, typefont, and overall layout of these ads are several notches
above anything we, or other vendors, have done in the past.  The second ad
dealt with a relocation service; this one includes snapshots of happy families
whose move was made easier by VAX.  If you're in ZK, I have these two posted
outside my office.

Subject: PDP-11 advertising!

DEC has actually been advertising the PDP-11!

One ad I've seen is a double-page spread.  On the left is the
headline:

       "In an industry where ideas come and go, there is one notable
        exception."

On the right, there's a graph of PDP-11 sales since 1970, and the
following text:

            "The computer industry is littered with products whose time
        came.  And went.

            "That's why, when we designted the PDP-11 architecutre in
        the 1970s, we wanted to create a computer family that would
        last.  And not only last, but constantly improve and offer
        more to the people who invest in it.

            "Well, 13 years later, we're happy to say that our plan
        looks better than ever.  This year Digital has introduced
        several important new PDP-11 products.

            "Among them:

            "A series of personal computers that are being hailed as
        the new industry standard.

            "A small, powerful Winchester-based system for under
        $10,000 that opens up a whole new range of possiblities for
        both technical and commercial applications.

            "And a new microprocessor that's the equivalent of the
        PDP-11/70, Digital's most powerful 16-bit minicomputer.
        Naturally, this product has immediate value to OEMs.  But it
        also has importance for every other computer user.  Because
        now that we've goteen all that power down to one
        microprocessor, we're busy thinking of all the new PDP-11
        computers we'll be able to design.

            "Which should give you something to look forward to for
        the next 13 years."

And then there was another double-page spread for the J-11.

On the left are pictures of the Zilog 8002, the Motorola 68000, and
the Intel 8086, labelled Brand Z, Brand M, and Brand I, respectively.
The headline over them is:

                        "Born."

On the right is a picture of the J-11 with the headline:

                        "Bred."

The text:

            "Digital's new 16-bit microprocessor chips were not born
        yesterday, they were bred from years of PPD-11 systems
        experience.

            "Our low-cost T-11 and our high-performance J-11 chips
        provide the most advanced software engines ever offered to
        this industry.  Including full function operating systems
        like MicroPower/Pascal, RSX-11M-PLUS, RT-11 and RSTS/E.  And
        more than a *dozen* languages."

        Etc. Etc.

Subject: ... and we complain about SDC

I picked up the latest DECdirect catalog, in which Accessories and Supplies
peddles their wares.  In the back of each issue, they run a series of
ads for various DEC services and products.  One of these shows a VAX in the
background with a disk cartridge in the foreground.  The text says "One
dirty cartridge can bring this entire system to a standstill."  It's
promoting Media Mantainence Services for disks.

The problem is, that disk, even when sparkling clean, would bring the VAX
to its knees.  It's an RK05, which isn't supported by VMS.  To compound
the problem, the volume label clearly reads "RSX-11M V3.2".

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Furthermore, the catalog is a mishmosh with memories on one page and
software manuals on the next.  They don't even give RSX and VMS
separate pages.

Subj:   Bad Joke of the Day

Times are tough and bound to get tougher but being the survivalist corporation
that we are DEC has come up with a plan. This plan devised by the bean counting
department with the help of several larger 11/780 systems provides for a simple
solution to turning around our slumping sales. This plan is a total reversal
of the long range plan conservative approach expounded by KO. Simply stated it
is this. DEC is going to hold a SUPER SALE. We will open the doors to all of
facilities arround the country to anybody who wants to come in. EVERYTHING
within sight will be for sale. Equipment will be sold by the pound on a sliding
scale. Items over 100 pounds will go for 5 cents a pound with all else going
10 cents a pound. This is to encourage selling packaged systems. All sales will
be cash under the table and carry only. A standard 90 minute warranty is
included.

The purpose of all this is to eliminate customer disatisfaction due to
equipment deliveries and provide for increased market share. It has the added
benifit of providing a dramatic increase in cash flow.

Comments on this plan may be sent to BEAN::COUNTERS.

The DEC ads on TV seem more interested in self-congratulation than in
selling computers to small businessmen or anybody else.  They're over
before I realize that it is a DEC ad.  My roommate wonders why we're
spending all that money to reinforce the reputation of computer people:
unintelligible, and even less interesting.
