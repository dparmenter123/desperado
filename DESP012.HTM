Subject: A desperate Desperado's plea for help

From time to time, I have sent out blurbs announcing shows  being  put
on  by Patchwork Theatre of Chelmsford (MA).  I thank those of you who
have responded and attended our productions.  Now I am sending out yet
another blurb for Patchwork, but of a different kind.

Theatre groups never have enough money.  This,  alas,  is  a  fact  of
life.   Our  particular  group  rarely  makes  money  from  its summer
productions (who does?).  Therefore, we must resort to other forms  of
raising  money  in  order to be able to put on our summer productions.
An easy and profitable way of making money, we found, is to have a Las
Vegas  Night.   We've  done  this  successfully 3 times, making enough
money to carry us through our summer seasons.  The last time, however,
was  a different story.  It was reported in the following Boston Globe
article on October 10:

               3 BREAK THE HOUSE AT GROUP'S VEGAS NIGHT

     Three sharpies walked into a theater group's Las Vegas Night
     in  Tewksbury  with  phony dice Friday night [October 8] and
     cleaned the innocent dealers  out  of  about  $1500  --  but
     that's only half the story.

     The three men at one point became fearful  that  their  ploy
     was  discovered  and they walked out, leaving the funny dice
     behind.

     The dealers, unaware of the scheme that was costing them big
     money,  let  the  game continue with the phony dice still in
     play.  This enabled other players  to  take  the  table  for
     another $1500.

     Finally, a college student filling  in  at  the  dice  table
     wondered  why  the the dice easily rolled double fours three
     times in a row, and quickly learned why:  The  dice  had  no
     2's, 3's, or 6's -- only 1's, 4's, and 5's.

     That story was told to police by Joan Kennedy, administrator
     and  cofounder of Patchwork Theatre of Chelmsford, the group
     which sponsored the Las Vegas Night at the  Holiday  Inn  in
     Tewksbury.

     She said in an interview, "...our  normal  Las  Vegas  Night
     gives  us  a  profit  of about $3000.  The craps table alone
     usually wins $3000 to $4000.  Last night [Friday, October 8]
     it dropped $3100 -- $1500 to the three sharpies and $1600 to
     innocent players  who  weren't  aware  that  the  dice  were
     stacked in their favor."

     Kennedy said the theater board held an emergency meeting  to
     figure  out  how to cover the deficit, $1000 of which is due
     winning bettors who couldn't collect  Friday  night  because
     the  "house" went broke.  She said the board decided to hold
     another Las Vegas "as soon as we can book the  room  at  the
     Holiday Inn."

     Kennedy described Patchwork  as  a  young  people's  theater
     group  for  students  at  the  junior high, high school, and
     college levels.  It puts on plays  and  gives  workshops  on
     theater skills.

     She said the amateur group turned to Las Vegas Nights  about
     two  years  ago  when  it  lost  funding from the Chelmsford
     Recreation Commission because of Proposition 2-1/2.

     Kennedy said there were about 140 gamblers in the room among
     the  12  blackjack tables, three poker tables, 3 wheels, the
     roulette  table,  and  the  craps  table,  when  the   three
     strangers walked in separately.

     Kennedy said:  "None of us is a professional gambler and the
     supplier  [of  the  gambling equipment] is prohibited by law
     from  approaching  any  of  the  tables.   The   three   men
     immediately began betting heavily, apparently slipping their
     funny dice in and out of the game by confusing  the  dealers
     with loud talk, complaints, and demands for payments on bets
     that had already been paid.

     "Pretty soon word got to me on the other side  of  the  room
     that  the  craps  table was losing heavily.  When some of us
     approached the table, the men apparently became  suspicious.
     Two  walked  out  a  side  door  and the third out the front
     door."

     Kennedy said the three men were seen driving away in  a  car
     she identified, with a touch of irony, as a Monte Carlo.

That was  a  fun  night,  let  me  tell  you  (I  was  there,  dealing
blackjack).   We  were a bit upset.  But we recovered and came up with
two immediate plans for raising money:

     1.  Another Las Vegas Night.  Yes, we're getting  right  back  on
         the horse, so to speak, and having another Las Vegas Night on
         Tuesday, November 9, at the Tewksbury Holiday  Inn  (on  Rte.
         38 right off of 495) from 7 to 11 PM.

     2.  A variety show, in which members of  Patchwork  Theatre  will
         perform  their  "greatest  hits" -- selections from "You're a
         Good Man, Charlie Brown," "The Sound of  Music,"  "Godspell,"
         "Hello  Dolly,"  and  "Once  Upon  a  Mattress." In addition,
         people from other area groups are going to  perform  excerpts
         from other Broadway shows.  This benefit show will take place
         on  Saturday,  November  20,  at  8:00  PM  at  the  McCarthy
         Auditorium  on  North Rd.  (alias Rte.  4) in Chelmsford, MA.
         Donation is $5.00.

Please come lose money at our Las Vegas Night.  It's for a good cause.
And then come to the variety show, where you can see for yourself just
how good a cause it is!

P.S.  We're also putting on Charles Dickens' "A  Christmas  Carol"  on
Saturday,  December 11.  Performances are at 2 PM and 8 PM at the Wang
Labs (!) Day Care Center (formerly Center School),  84  Billerica  Rd.
(Rte.  129), Chelmsford.

                   IS THE VMS DOC SET NUGATORY?

Here's some response to the comments about DEC documentation.

Actually, although the UDA-50 hypercube was a dubious analogy, it was
an attempt on the part of the writer to express the inexpressible.
The problem with metaphors and other figures of speech in technical
writing is precisely that they are figures of speech.  They can never
express any relationship exactly.  If you visualize the universe as an
expanding balloon with dots printed on it, you may or may not gain in
understanding, but you are certainly not visualizing the universe.

I think DEC has some good books and some bad books--some of which I
wrote--but I think DEC will have to have better documentation to meet
our new markets.  I also think that documentation includes everything
the user sees, from keycaps to error messages to command formats.

The purpose of *all* software is to make the computer easier to use
and the documentation is as much a part of the software as the code.

The software does what the documentation says it does.

I agree with Mr. Middleton concerning the atrocious example given in
the UDA-50 documentation. However, a rapid defense of the reputation
of our technical writing staff is clearly in order. Constructive
criticism (fancy words meaning "review") of documentation is ALWAYS
accepted but never is available in sufficient quantity to most
writers. However, abusive statements such as the ones in his mail are
completely unwarranted. No one is naive enough to believe that our
documentation is perfect, but then again neither is the software.
However, we have thousands of customers who simply believe that
both are just about the best in the industry for their particular
applications. I recommend that we treat this unfortunate piece of
mail like another crank SPR.

By the way, I always found military manuals to be extremely boring,
repetitive, and written far beneath my level of intelligence. However,
I never read any of their computer manuals, only some of the stuff
on weapons, etc.

Subject: Nuke a Tory for amusement.

Actually the reference to NUGATORY in the MSCP spec is a Storage Systems in-
joke. Everyone has their favorite obscure words that they manage to use more
than other people. (EPONYMOUS is one of my current favorites - it's surprising
how often you can use it, if you really try.) NUGATORY was a favorite of the
author of the MSCP spec; it appeared so many times in the original drafts that
it became a kind of a joke among those who were reviewing the document.
Apparently later editing removed all occurances but the one cited, which was
kept, along with the convenient definition, for sentimental reasons and for
the amusement of those who had seen the earlier drafts.

I agree with HYDRA::MIDDLETON;  something must be done about that UDA50
manual.  Hyper-geometry has no place in technical writing.

I was surprised to hear that that he doesn't like VMS documentation,
though.  I write VMS manuals, and we have never heard from John Middleton
before this.  (I have invited him to review my current documentation plan,
though.)

Anyhow, DESPERADOES, I have decided to volunteer myself as the DESPERADO
VAX/VMS documentation ombudsman.  Send your constructive critiques of the
version 3 documents to me, DELPHI::MALONEY, and I'll make sure that the right
person sees 'em.

No vague impressions or cheap shots, though.  Remember, the Japanese
don't snipe at each other.  Right, Rosie?

We do not produce very good documentation.
But we do it a hell of a lot better than most of our competitors.

If the engineering organizations would wake up and realize that
documentation is part of the product -- NOT a service or
a fancy extra, our documentation would be the best there is.

As long as documentation is treated as the bastard child
of engineering (or even worse, the bastard child of
educational services), we will NEVER have good documentation.

As long as writers are paid less than engineers of comparable skill
level, we will NEVER have good documentation.

As long as managers continue to view writing as a non-technical
job, we will NEVER have good documentation.

As long as writers view writing as a non-technical job, we
will NEVER have good documentation.

As long as all the efforts to "help writers be more productive"
are aimed at helping writers be typesetters and book designers
and not freeing the writers from typesetting so that they can spend
their timer writing, it's useless to even think about having
good documentation.

As long as software development continues to believe "we won't need
writers when we have online documentation", we might as well
not even have writers now, because we will NEVER have good documentation.
