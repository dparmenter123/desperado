No, this is not an example of the new look for Desperado! Although if you
will check out the virtual masthead, you will see John Covert's name up
there as publisher and my name as editor.

You need to know how to reach the new management. Send contributions to
BOOKIE::NEILSEN. Send mailing list requests to CASTOR::DESPERADO_REQUEST
or even CASTOR::DESPERADO-REQUEST. Far be it from us to discriminate
against hyphens.

This is not to say that mail sent to AUTHOR::PARMENTER or KERMIT::PARMENTER
won't reach us. It will. Or that contributions sent to John won't end up
on my desk and subscription requests sent to me will be lost. About the
only thing place you can put your contribution that we won't find it
is into the trunk of a hollow tree, and I have a few squirrels on the
payroll that are working on that.

So hang by your thumbs, write if you get work, and we'll see you at Tom's
going-away party!
