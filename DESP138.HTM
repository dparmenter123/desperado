Well, kids, Christmas is at our throats once more, as my dear mother used to
say. Mind you, my dear mother was and is convinced that Christmas comes
sometime in the middle of January, and December 25 always takes her by
surprise. "Kind of early this year, isn't it?" she'll say.

Me, I'm hanging out with New England choral societies more than ever. If
you're in Southern New Hampshire, consult other  sources for news of the
Spit Brook Singers' Christmas concert. Not one word shall pass my lips.
I hope you appreciate that. It goes to my heart not to tell you that
you should sneak into Babbage at noon on Tuesday, December 17, for the
open dress rehearsal or Wednesday, December 18, for the concert. But I feel
a certain responsibility to my constituency.

What appears to go your hearts this week is Baby Puppies! I'll take that
first call now...

Subj:   Another War Story about flying...

I remember an amusing incident I experienced in September 1980. I am married to
a girl from the Philippines and we were flying out from Heathrow to Manila on a
British Airways TriStar for a months holiday and of course for me to meet the
in-laws. The first port of call on the flight out was Abu Dhabi in the Persian
Gulf and it was here that about 50 Filipino workers boarded the aircraft. They
had been working in Saudi for n years and were returning home for the first
time having made their fortune. Understandably they were in high spirits. They
sat directly behind us. The fact that my wife was the first girl from the
homeland they'd seen in n years is another story. As we dropped down over the
main island of Luzon and approached Manila these people got more and more
excited to the extent that the hostess had to be quite forceful to get them to
fasten seat belts.

Well, I've flown enough as a passenger and done enough flying myself to know a
good landing from a bad one and believe me this was a bad one. The final few
hundred feet were very shaky and as we crossed the runway threshold we dropped
like a stone. One could sense that everyone on board was aware we were about
to hit the runway hard (everyone except the Filipino workers contingent that
is!). It is a strange feeling. No one looks at each other, a silence falls over
everyone and they just grip their armrests till their knuckles are white. Well
we did hit the ground hard, we also bounced very high. At this point though
theoretically we had touched the homeland's sacred soil and all these
Filipino workers leaped up, cheered and were almost dancing in the aisles,
blissfully unaware that everyone else on board were apprehensively awaiting
the next bounce.

I'm reminded that Arthur C. Clarke has also written of his difficulties
with cranks, who generally write him letters rather than telephoning
(one of the advantages of living in Sri Lanka, no doubt).  He came up
with his solution serendipitously.  He would awaken in the middle of the
night with the idea of the Great Terran Novel and write it all down,
only to discover in the morning that the prepositions and articles were
all perfectly legible, but the important nouns and verbs were mere
scribbles.  So he would answer cranks with a letter reading something
like this:

Dear Mr. scribble,

I was very scribble to receive your most scribble scribble.  I was
impressed by the scribble, especially the scribble part.  However, I
regret that I am scribble to give this work the scribble it so richly
scribble.  I am therefore scribbling you to scribble as soon as possible

Another derivative (i.e., second-hand) item.  No self-respecting author would
have had the nerve to invent this, but fortunately it's true:

        Margaret Burke visited St. Jude's Church near Rochester, N.Y., nine days
        straight, praying for help with her financial problems.  On the ninth
        day, she found an envelope at the feet of the saint's statue and thought
        her prayers were answered.  The envelope contained $10,000 in cash.  Un-
        fortunately, the cash had been left by another parishioner as an anony-
        mous donation.  When church officials tracked down Mrs. Burke -- who had
        by then spent the money to pay bills, buy furniture, fix her car, and
        advance a daughter's education -- they had her charged with grand lar-
        ceny.  Charges were dropped soon after in response to unfavorable
        publicity.

        First, my apologies to other Delawareians for forgetting
Longword Gardens.

        While I'm on the subject (tricky, eh?),  did I mention
the Delaware State Museum in Dover?   It is a very small museum,
but has a large collection of Victrolas and Gramophones.  Last I
was there, they had listening rooms if you have an old 78rpm
record you need to hear.

        If you are farther south, toward the beach, visit the
University of Delaware at Cape Henlopen.  They have a marine
research center that gives tours.  I'm not sure if special
arrangements are needed, so call first.   When I was there
last, there were several experiments of "sea farming".  Sea
farming is the idea of cultivating shell fish -- planting
little oysters or clams in a controlled environment, and
harvesting them when they get large.   There was also a
wave tank used for a beach erosion study.   If you are
interested in scientific "museums",  be sure to stop by.

        Well gang, enough of my guided tour of Delaware.  Should
we talk about New England choral societies instead?  :-)

Winner and Still Champion

    In the bubbly battle of Coke vs. Coke, the outcome is turning
out to be no contest.  A red-faced Coca-Cola conceded last week
that its original soft drink, which the company tried to bury in
April only to revive as Classic Coke in July, is outselling New
Coke, the drink's would-be successor.  Industry insiders said that
Classic Coke led New Coke 6 to 1 in some areas.
    Coca-Cola, which last week reported third-quarter profits of
$196 million, up 12% from a year ago, was far from ready to call
New Coke a goof or to yank the heavily promoted product from
the market.  The company claims that the combination of New
and Classic Coke has made the world's leading soft drink more
popular than ever.  It also pointed out that New Coke is outsell-
ing Classic Coke 2 to 1 in Canada and as much as 10 to 1 in Puer-
to Rico, the only places outside the continental U.S. where it is
currently available.
    One question remains for consumers suffering from an acute
case of Coca-Cola confusion.  Do Cherry Coke, diet Coke and
caffeine-free Coke have the New or the Classic formula?  The
answer to that is neither.  Each drink has a separate recipe
of its own.

From USENET:

        Based on the anecdotal accounts of the use of a Coca Cola douche as
a form of contraception in the third world, and the recent New Coke/Classic
Coke debate, 3 doctors at Harvard Medical School published a letter in the
New England Journal of Medicine comparing the spermicidal effects of
New Coke and Classic.  Their result was that Classic Coke was 5 times more
effective at killing sperm in-vivo than its new emasculated formula, suggesting
not pH but rather some factor in the "secret formula" was responsible.
        The conclusion of the study was, at least in this area, "'Classic'
Coke Is It."
        It was written as a scientific account, but it was a joke -- since
sperm in found in the oviducts within minutes and hence douching is an
ineffective form of contraception.

        However, this article was picked up in the popular press, which lost
its subtle wit in the translation, and now many people fear women might try
it.   Spread the word:  it's a bad idea -- douching doesn't work for one, and
two, even Coke Classic leaves about 8% of the sperm alive after the first
minute.  Lastly, there is a small chance of the CO2 carbonation forming gas
bubbles in the blood - with serious consequences. So, restrict Coca-Cola to
your mouth.

Associated Press:  Waterbury, Conn. -

Armed police surrounded two gangland-style characters backing  out  of  a  bank
yesterday, but the incident was over before you could say "toy gun."

"It  was  an accident, a mistake," United Way spokesman John Dicenzo said after
the fund-raising event went awry.

The Banking Center, in cooperation with United Way, was rehearsing  a  skit  in
front  of its building as part of its status report on mid-campaign pledges.  A
man and a woman brandishing toy machine  guns  and  dressed  as  Depression-era
outlaws  Bonnie  and  Clyde  were  to drive up to the bank and bring in bags of
money for the United Way.

But police had not been informed, an inspector said.   When  an  patrolman  saw
suspicious activity, he called for reinforcements.

    Reproduced here in full is yesterday's Miles Kington "Moreover" column
    from the Times. Despite the serious nature of the topic, I rate this the
    most brilliant piece of satire I have seen in several years.

            ---------------------------------------------------

    Chess fans will be glued to their teleprinters today for the start of the
    long-awaited world championship between Russian maestro Mikhail Gorbachov
    and the whirlwind American master Ronald Reagan. Both are recognized as
    being the best in the world today, so many people are forecasting a long
    series of draws, but the battle for supremacy should provide many moments
    of excitement and play of the highest quality.

    Their styles provide an absorbing study of contrasts. Gorbachov is a
    typical product of the Soviet chess machine, methodical, thoughtful and
    bent on gradual domination of the board by any means. Previous encounters
    between East and West have been overshadowed by the tendency of the Russian
    champion to die just when things were getting exciting, but the Russians
    have cleverly chosen a young man this time, and whatever Gorbachov lacks,
    it will not be stamina.

    Reagan, by contrast, is a much more mercurial player, some would say
    distrait. He tends on occasion to forget that he is playing a game of chess,
    or to get the name of his opponent mixed up with somebody completely
    different, but his huge following insists that he represents all that is
    best about America and no other American has close come to challenging him.
    Here, for instance, is a recent game in which Reagan skilfully exploits his
    opponent's conventional approach to strategy.

                White Reagan; Black Mondale
                Nicaraguan Defence

        1       P-K4    P-QB4           2       P-K4    P-Q3
        3       P-K4    N-KB3           4       P-K4    resigns

    Maddened by Reagan's brilliant option of doing the same move over and over
    again, the usually unflappable Mondale blows up and resigns. This tactic
    of saying or doing the same thing over and over again is one invented by
    Reagan. Some experts call it innovatory, others say it's because he doesn't
    know any other move, but this is disproved by another recent Reagan game.

                White El Salvador; Black Reagan
                White House Offensive

        1       P-K4    P-K5!           2       resigns

    Here, Reagan uses another tactic of his own invention, that of moving the
    other man's pieces. There is no answer to this, especially when Reagan owns
    the chess board, the chess pieces and the chess officials. Another pretty
    example of Reagan's fresh approach to the game comes from a very recent
    short encounter with Prince Charles.

                White Prince Charles; Black Reagan
                Nancy Variation

        1       P-K4    Q-SW1!          2       draw agreed

    Reagan prefers short, sharp games, as if he cannot conceive of any chess
    encounter going on much beyond five moves, but Gorbachov is an
    intriguingly different customer. Here is an excerpt from a game played
    last month, starting at the 25th move.

                White Gorbachov; Black Rest of the World
                KGB Gambit

       25       Q-B6    PxQ!           26       Q=Q!!

    What this unusual sign means is that Gorbachov suddenly revealed that his
    opponent's Queen had been working for the Russians all along! In an
    amazing press conference in Moscow, the so-called Black Queen testified
    that she had been drugged and forced to play for Black against her will,
    and that from now on she would be playing for White. This turned the whole
    game in Gorbachov's favour.

    Here is another eaxample of the wily Russian's play, from a recent game in
    the Kabul championships.

                White Gorbachov; Black Afghanistan
                Tank Defence

       36       RxB,R,P,P

    What seems to have happened here is that Gorbachov actually orders part of
    the chess board to be blown up, an unconventional move but one which does
    not actually seem to be against the local rules. We have a picture,
    in fact, of two players who on their own terms are unbeatable but who
    have never met any player of their own class before, nor one so much
    outside their own experience. Our experts will be on hand to analyse every
    move between the irresistible Gorbachov and the veteran Reagan, who is
    said to be perfecting a new Star Pawn defence which Gorbachov can never
    pierce. Whatever happens, it is certain that neither side will admit
    defeat.

Subj:   A hot tip

I've never been able to keep up with popular culture, and so
my hot tip is probably something the rest of you already know,
but here goes.

As reported on WBCN this morning, the new Steven Spielberg movie,
"Young Sherlock Holmes", is quite good.  However, Mr. Laquidara
advises us not to bolt out of the theatre when the movie appears
to be over because if you sit through the credits, the ending
changes.

If you find out what happens before I do, which you probably will,
please don't tell me what happens.  There are so few surprises
left to me anymore.

    request, apparently in response to his recent receipt of our
    now world famous  "Third Party Software Catalog":

        "In order to know what had gone before, I would like
        to have a copy of each first and second party
        software catalogs if they are are still available."

    Any suggestions on how we should respond??

Subj:   Are there genetic problems with mating Desperadi?

For those of you who know DSSDEV::TABER as "&gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJTT" and for those
of you who know OZ::DAHLBERG as "KAD", this might be of passing
interest:

&gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJTT combined with KAD in holy matrimony on November 2nd 1985.
It was a wonderfully sloshy Saturday for the nervous bride and groom,
but it somehow all came together.   Mr &amp; Mrs&gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJTT then set sail,
on a frightful old tub of a ship (SS ROYALE -- be warned), for five days
in the Bahamas and three at Disneyworld.

OZ::DAHLBERG will shortly be available as OZ::TABER and, of course,
DSSDEV::TABER is always available for anything as DSSDEV::TABER.

I've already taken a broadside from a feminist friend who's complaining
that I changed my name.  Please, no more broadsides.  TABER is easier to
spell than DAHLBERG and thus makes all the sense in the world to me...

(Oh, by the way... On your next plane trip, check the pilot.  If he's
wearing Mickey Mouse ears, it's my brother-in-law Peter.)

If he's wearing Mickey Mouse ears, I'm getting off the plane, even if I don't
find out about it until after we've taken off...

And I want to know if you two met through DESPERADO, and if so, do I get a
finder's fee?
