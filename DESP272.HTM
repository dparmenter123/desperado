 Those who profess to be disturbed by what they imagine to be the
 distortion of justice inherent in the OJ defense are invited to
 ponder the defense mounted by William Aramony.  This gentleman, you
 will recall, is the former head of the United Way, accused of
 looting the charity of hundreds of thousands of dollars to finance
 life of luxury, including in Aramony's case, a romance with a
 17-year-old girl.  How could this have happened?  Aramony's lawyers
 put it forward that there were three causes:

        In the first place, the United Way's board of directors was
        not performing appropriate oversight.

        Secondly, Aramony's underlings were up to something and he
        couldn't control them.

        And the man in the middle, the defendant?  Why he's suffering
        from a rare disorder that is causing his brain to shrink.

 By the way, in case you'd forgotten that there has been more than one
 trial in recorded history, black jurors vote to convict black
 defendants every day.

 Every time he rolls his eyes, OJ loses ground with the jury.

 Not that a romance with a 17-year-old girl (particularly one who
 would romance a stuffed shirt like Aramony) would strike everybody as
 an unencumbered luxury.

 Switching our attention from the criminal to the civil courts:  A
 first-degree burn reddens and swells the skin.  A second-degree burn
 causes blisters.  A third-degree burn destroys the skin.  I don't
 doubt that the lady who spilled the McDonald's coffee in her lap was
 burned.  I don't doubt that McDonald's was careless and arrogant
 about the heat of their coffee.  That said, she did not suffer
 third-degree burns in the incident.  Could you burn a steak with
 boiling water?

Subject: E-Prime

Having recently learned of the existence of E-Prime I feel duty-bound
to advise you of it.  My source is an essay entitled "'To Be' in Their
Bonnets", written by Cullen Murphy and published in his book _Just
Curious_.

E-Prime is a human language.  It is essentially English, from which
all inflections of the verb "to be" have been subtracted.  Apparently,
a large faction of E-Prime advocates exists in the world of general
semantics.  Their concern about "to be" is summed up in a passage from
George Santayana.

    The little word "is" has its tragedies.  It names and identifies
    different things with the greatest innocence; and yet no two are
    ever identical, and if therein lies the charm of wedding them and
    calling them one, therein too lies the danger.  Whenever I use the
    word "is", except in sheer tautology, I deeply misuse it; and when
    I discover my error, the world seems to fall asunder.

Practitioners of E-Prime strive to eliminate "to be" from their
writing, but a few stouthearted individuals even use E-Prime in
speech.  Murphy interviewed the most accomplished of these, and
reports

    I expected to hear someone speaking in a slow and considered
    manner, as if picking his way uncertainly through a linguistic
    swamp, but he talked briskly and with what sounded like supreme
    self-confidence.  Yes, he said, he halted a lot when he first
    started speaking E-Prime, in 1978, and a lot of sentences ended
    abruptly in the middle when he could see himself running into an
    "is".  At times he lapsed into a kind of pidgin E-Prime.  The
    transition, in short, took some work.  "I had to cope with all
    that backlog of "is"-pattern English," he explained.  "And I had
    to do it in real time."  But [he] got the hang of it stylistically
    after a year or so, and he now strives in his speech . . . to
    effect other refinements.  These include ridding his vocabulary of
    instances of absolutism (for example, such words as "always" and
    "never", which imply immutability) and of many nouns made out of
    verbs (in particular those with a "-tion" ending, such as
    "visualization" and "procrastination", which freeze ongoing
    processes into static events). . . .  "I try to move toward a
    language that communicates the territory of my experience to
    myself and others as clearly and accurately as possible."

Of course, Murphy's essay is written entirely in E-Prime.  Wanting to
avoid the headache he claims it caused, I didn't even try.

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 Oh, my.  I take exception to the opening remark that "E-prime is a
 human language".  These are nothing but word games, playing that
 there is something mathematical or philosophical about verbal
 expression.  Who says "is" means "equals"?  (Indeed, as we know from
 Lisp, there are degrees of equality, that is EQ means "equal to the
 same thing" while EQUAL means "the same thing".)  We all understand
 that "always" may be no more than "often" and "never" may only be
 "rarely".  The objection to nouns made of verbs is sheer snobbery.
 If these folks are sincere (I see you smirking, Mr. Santayana.),
 they'd also be eliminating all figures of speech from the language.
 Only the Laconians are laconic and the only mammals are females and a
 pinafore must be pinned on the forepart and a bonfire is only for
 burning bones.

 The verb "to be" has a set of meanings just like any other word in
 the language.  Does Santayana object to these meanings of "to be"?

        "exist" -- "To be or not to be"
        "happen" -- "the wedding is tomorrow"
        "located" -- "the hat is on his head"
        "belong or befall" -- "The force is with him"
        "remain" -- "Let it be, E Primers"

 As the Jewish granny of the story says, "Smart smart.  Dumb dumb".

Tom,

I was delighted to read, and be reminded, by Dan (dan@hq.lec.com) of
Groucho's last "live" moment.  That is, Dan didn't quite finish the story
(and this is the great part).  Media history will verify that the last
line Groucho ever uttered on "This Is Your Life" was the one Dan reported
while "warming up" a female, catholic contestant.

It was the era of live censors.  It was their moment of glory and "This
Is Your Life" ended in mid-show.  Ah, but what a show Groucho. . . . and
whatta cigar!

Had it been Harpo's show, the line just wouldn't have come off as well
(honk, honk) but he might have stayed on the air.  But then, he too,
could have been accused of being horny.

&gt;From the karate mailing list:

    Due to circumstances I have been embroiled in several "real" situations.
    I have had guns pulled on me four times.  Never had a knife pulled on
    me (thank goodness).  Have been assulted with a motor vehicle.  Been
    approached by a fellow with a baseball bat.  Been involved in two
    riots (I was not the perpetrator but the recipient), plus numereous
    empty hand situations, some dangerous, and some less than serious.
    I have been in it for real with another karate egg-spurt, in a
    serious situation.  I had a student who defended himself against
    fourty (40).  My teacher was attacked by 15+ in Viet Nam.  (Fifteen
    is how many he downed before he finally outdistanced them. ha ha)
    My son has been attacked by four several years ago.  He was attacked
    by two in a knifing attempt, and I don't know what else, because he
    doesn't boast.  Those are stories that I dragged out of him for a
    reason.  I had a fellow try to hire me to murder a guy once.  But
    when he decided I wouldn't do it, tried to hire one of my students
    who was the brother of the new county attorney. They stung him bad.

I used to work at the University of Chicago library when I was an
undergraduate.  They actually have a rubber stamp that says "PERMANENT
LOAN" which is used occasionally to mark the cards of crumbly old
books that have been shipped off to rot in some other library's
cellar.

Just fyi,
