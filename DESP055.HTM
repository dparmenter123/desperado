On another geographical front, New York, New York, the city so nice they
named it twice, has screwed up so many things for so long that I and most
other native New Yorkers I know are pleasantly suprised to find that they
have done something right.

In the Riverdale section of the Bronx, just west of the Saw Mill River
Parkway, stands a twenty-story building with metal shutters on the
outside of its windows and a copse of antennae on its roof. This
building, between 254th and 255th streets, serves as living quarters
for the Soviet mission to the UN.  Around it is a 12-foot tall fence
made of what look like wrought-iron javelins, and in front of it is a
small guard house, manned by one of New York's finest.

Across from this building is a small park, just a few thousand square
feet of coblestones, a few trees and shrubs, and a couple of park
benches.  The park was once named for some minor hero of local
significance, but the City has renamed it Shcharansky Square.

Anatoly Shcharansky is an enemy of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, an enemy who has indulged in counterrevolutionary activity
by spreading illegal and untrue Western propaganda regarding so-called
violations of the Helsinki Accords by the Motherland, and this despite
the fact that it is well-known that the Helsinki Accords are little
more than a thinly disguised plot by the West to besmirch the Soviet
People and their fight for class equality.  For this, Shcharansky has
been shipped 5000 miles east of Moscow, stripped of his job, his
books, his access to professional literature - He is a physicist -
denied communication with his family, denied an exit visa, jailed,
humiliated, and abused.

I thought it a nice touch by His Honor, the Mayor, to name the front
yard of the Soviet appartment building Shcharansky Square because it
forces the Soviet citizens who live there to confront the lie that
they live every day.

Could this be the dreaded 'Real Programmer Syndrome'?
Article from Sunday Times, 13 March by Peter Wilby:

A new type of drug addict is worrying university teachers: the
computer junkie, who skips lectures for a daily fix at the terminal.
Students have been known to clock up 35 hours in four days on the
computer including 17 without a break.

Now the dons are monitoring students' use of computers and, at Brunel
University, addicts are rationed to five hours a week. Those who take
an overdose, may lose marks on course work.

Most addicts are studying computer science, but physics and
engineering students may also fall victim. Chris Reynolds, reader in
computer science at Brunel, says junkies almost invariably do badly in
exams because they concentrate on programming to the exclusion of
other areas.

He fears some students may spend five hours a night on home computers
in their halls of residence.

Computers are addictive, he says, because they are neat, tidy and
logical. "People talk to computers in the same way as children talk to
dolls. There are not likely to be any social conflicts."

Reynolds says students are encouraged by schools and parents to apply
for computer science because they have spent so much time on home
computers. "In fact, the technology they pick up isn't much use to
them because, in terms of computer languages, it's archaic. And their
enthusiasm may be the result of some personality problem. I fear that
computer science is tending to attract introverts"

Computer science attract introverts?  Nah!  In England, maybe, but not
here.

Speaking of vortices, VORTEX is the home of the keepers of the ENET
map, but since VORTEX is new to the net, I can't get the map to find
out where VORTEX is.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ......but....but... We wrote this routing stuff so you didn't need a
map! What you really need to know is, "What VORTEX's node address?".
Or in practical terms, "Who is this node #1 that I keep finding out is
reachable, anyways?"

In any case, I think Miller was just keeping node addresses 1 thru 5
reserved for so long, just so he could get #1!  Why he named it VORTEX
is beyond me.

Now for Lauren, and the uniqueness of node names in the world, too
bad. We've got an even bigger problem coming when everyone starts
trying to hook PC's onto the Enet and wants to use their last name or
something like that.  Node names will probably have to become
structured just like area codes.  The only network that I know of that
comes close to dealing with this type of problem is the proposed PCNET
(Personal Computer Net) "architecture".  PCNET nodes are qualified by
their Phone number and their Geographical coordinates in Latitude and
Longitude.   The latter is used to help figure out routing, the
former, the address.

My neighbors moved to Florida some time ago. They took all their
worldly possessions with them, save one - they left their dog, Clancy.

Poor Clancy has been staying at or around my house these past couple
of months. I would adopt him but I have an oldish (almost 14) dog of
my own, and she does not take kindly to Clancy. She has squatters
rights, but he keeps squatting on her rights. Therefore, she has not
been happy. I would like her to be happy in her declining years. So,
I'm trying to find a good home for a good dog - Clancy.

Clancy is a male Irish Setter (but he had them cut off). He would make
a great spring training present for someone. I estimate his age to be
three years, and my Vet agrees. I took him for all of his shots on
Saturday, and for a dog that [to my knowledge] has never been in a car
he was great. The Vet gave him a clean bill of health, but he could
stand to lose about five pounds.

Clancy loves the outdoors and the indoors. I had some fears when my
wife started letting him in the house, but he has excellent manners
(except in my old dog's eyes). He has not made a mess of any kind in
the house. He likes other dogs, and loves to play, especially with
children.

If anyone out there has further interest in Clancy, I have some
photos. Send me mail at BABEL::AUDIO or call me at 881-2029. I'd be
happy to show them to you.

Here's a blurb from Business Week, March 21, 1983 issue:

A money-back guarantee is now packed with every office automation computer
from Digital Equipment Corp.  The ploy--unusual in computer marketing--will
allow an unhappy customer to return his system within 20 days after delivery
for a full refund of the hardware purchase price and the software license
fees.  If history is any indication, the guarantee could spread:  DEC was
among the first computer makers to guarantee product reliability.

This is the first I've heard of this.  Does anyone know if a customer has
returned a system because they didn't like it?

American Bell is about to announce a personal workstation called the 3B-5.
According to David Fielder, president of InfoPro Systems, "the 3B-5 will
capture the market just because of the Bell name associated both with a
personal computer and with one running Bell's own Unix.  Fielder points
out that Bell's Unix, rather than the look-alike Unix's that have sprung
up, is particularly desirable among computer users.  Moreover, the
Bell Unix is must likely to be bug free since Bell invented Unix,
and thus no-one knows Unix better than Bell."

The GLOBE Tuesday ran an interesting filler about M*A*S*H. The last
episode had a Nielsen rating of 72% in the metropolitan New York area.
Morover, when the show ended that night, the flow rate in New York's
Number 1 and Number 2 water mains increased by a total of 320 million
gallons. A spokesman for the city's  Dept. of Environmental Protection
(!) said "... you'd have to have one million people flushing their
toilets at the same time to achieve that rate." Anyway, after geting
both the Nielsen ratings and this report about New York's water flow,
CBS must be, uh, flushed with pride.

By the way, the spokesman also pointed out that the flow rate often
jumps at the end of baseball playoff games, but not at the end of the
Super Bowl, apparently because there are so many timeouts in football.
Take that, you neanderthal football fans. Spring is here, and the real
national pastime will soon be back.

The note on Boston grammar was amusing, but wouldn't have made it into the
book "Boston English," (illustrated with photos of Paul Barstow as the very
propah Boston Brahmin - in what we like to call 'real life,' Paul is a pro-
fessor at Wellesley College and a part-time actor, and not at all propah).
This guide to spoke Bostonese contains such examples as 'potty': "Ah you

My comment on the 4-ball rally (rally??) is that it's a machobscenity,
about which only lousy movies could be made. The roads are hazardous
enough without a few dozen overprivileged nutcakes going crosscountry at
167 mph for a $10000 prize (or any other amount, for that matter), Burt
Reynolds and the Dukes of Hazzard notwithstanding. Can Rollerball be far

I have been fruitlessly worrying for some time about the meaning/origin of
the phrase 'the whole nine yards.'  Whenever it was used in my presence
I asked the speaker what it meant; responses have always been the
equivalent of ' . . . duhhhhhhhh . . .'  But we may have a solution!!!
After several months of well deserved harassment to establish a meaning
or stop babbling the phrase, Ron Uberti has come through.  He suggests
it might mean 'the whole nine cubic yards of concrete' in a cement-truck
load.  E.g., 'how much of this load do you want dumped for the rear patio?'
'I want the whole nine yards.'  Ron said this explanation 'sounds intuitively
right to me,' and I agree.  A quick check on the blackboard with dimly
remembered solid geometry kept hopes alive, and an equally quick check with
a local contractor confirmed that while the smallest cement truck size
is eight cubic yards, and there are many different larger sizes, that
nine cubic yards is vary definitely one of the standard sizes.  I propose
that Desperadi vote unanimously that this be accepted as the final solution.

Yesterday I got a flyer from The Bear Tribe Medicine Society wanting
to know if I'd like to take a workshop to help heal mother earth, no
thanks. Today I received a course catolog from The Omega Institute of
Holistic Studies. These are not your run of the mill courses. How about
a one week course titled "Humor, Creativity &amp; Magic" . No, well how
about "Making a True Move" or "Chinese Animal Frolics". Don't give up
yet there is always "T'ai Chi I", "Zen of Seeing", "Conference of the
Birds" and the list goes on and on. I was going to take a course in
MACRO-11 but am wondering if I'd be better off with "Neurolinguistic
Programming". I know, you're wondering who is on the faculty. How about
Wavy Gravy? He teachs "Life is a Circus I and II". They are so proud
to have him on the staff that they put his picture in the catalog.
He is wearing a baseball hat turned sideways. Not any baseball hat mind
you, but one with dandelions sticking out of it. But wait, maybe I'm judging
a book by it's cover. Among his list of credits is "known as the Santa
Claus most arrested at nuclear installations on the West Coast".
Impressed ? There's no problem if you can't attend a course they will
still be your friend. I am not joking. For $5,000 (or more) they will be
your "Lifetime Friend". I wonder if they would be my special friend for
$10,000 ? For all of you who are interested I'll list the address:

        A TOUR OF THE SIMPSON SPRING BOTTLING PLANT IN EASTON, MASS.

        Here's a tour that may appeal to those intrigued by old
machinery and one that provides handson experience in the way things
were in the 1920's.

The Simpson Spring Company of South Easton is a survivor amoung a
small group of independent soft-drink manufacturers in the US today,
and on the first Saturday of each month, though October, the plant
is open to the public.  There is a small museum where anyone with
a hankering for the mechanical can operate bottle cappers and other
machinery of bygone days.  A guided tour of the plant itself, in
full operation, leads you through the syrup room, where the oils
of vanilla, sweet birch, and cofee are made into bases for cream,
white birch, and coffee sodas; then continues to the laboratory
and the white-tiled spring room, where you can glimpse the source
of the sparkling water used in their sodas; and ends with as visit
to the bottling line.

The Simpson Spring Factory building has remained virtually unchanged
since it was designed in the '20's.  Company president Edwin White is
proud of his product, especially the all-time favorite - cofee soda.
Simpson Spring also produces Moxie and, as an added attraction, the
Moxie Horsemobile, a 1930 LaSalle with the colorful Moxie Mascot
mounted on its hood, is parked out front.  According to White, it's
"there for kids to clamber on."

Tours of the Simpson Springs plant are scheduled for September 6
and October 4, between 9 a.m and 2 p.m.  Any group larger than
15 should make arrangments by calling 238-4472.  The plant is located
just off Route 138, in South Easton.
