       TAG TEAM MATCH: COMPETING ANALYSTS VS. DUELLING BANJOS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

DEC is now analyzing the competition for the PDP-11.  Amazing, huh?
It's a new DEC, alright!  A competitive analysis group has now sprung
up and is seeking micros and off-DEC minis to play around with and
analyze.  If you have a small system and are willing to have one of
your fellow employes fiddle around with it in the interests of greater
profits, please respond to Charla Foote-Cole, or, as we know her,
ALIEN::BEING::CHARLA.

Maybe the reason the Wally Schirra commercial was shown only during
NCC last year has to do with the fact that Wally Schirra is probably
a household word in few places nowadays, one of them being of course
Houston (home of Houston Space Center). Except for Frank Borman
and John Glenn, astronauts just ain't IN these days.

NCC was of course held in Houston last year, hence the astronautical
tie in for the first PC ad campaign.

IBM does indeed make the IBM PC.  Although I can't state with any degree of
certainty the origins of the various pieces of the thing, I do know that it is
being assembled in IBM's Boca Raton, Florida plant.  Now, I admit that periph-
erals are another story entirely - e.g., the printer is an Epson MX-80 in all
but the color of its plastic.

Also, the Apple IIe does not come standard with the 80-column display, although
upper/lower case is standard. The 80-column feature is embodied on a daughter-
board that plugs into a special peripheral slot located apart from the (now)
seven standard slots.  If the purchaser elects to use the Apple 80-column card,
then he/she is constrained from installing ANYTHING in Slot 3, which is where
the 80-col card goes on older Apples.

The big wonderfulness of the Apple IIe is the chip count - 31 - on the main
board.  Of course, while making the machine cheaper and enabling the inclusion
of more features, this change also has its detrimental side.  Consider for a
moment that most of those 31 chips are Apple CUSTOM stuff - then shiver at the
price you'll pay to get the bugger fixed when one of them dies...

Also, be warned that certain programs for the Apple II+ just won't work on the
IIe.  These programs are primarily third-party stuff that uses undocumented
entry points into the monitor or DOS.  Apple gave the serious third-party
vendors a good jump toward fixing their programs by providing information on
the new internal software more than six months before the formal release of the
IIe, but not everyone was interested in changing, or so I would guess...

I have long felt that Radio Shlock hardware was not up to snuff, and I am glad
to know that I have not been alone.  A friend purchased a Color Computer for
Christmas, and he has already had to take it back for repair.  Seems someone
touched the metal part of the joystick handle, eliciting a static shock, and
the whole computer up and quit.  I have to commend the dealer, though - they
just gave him a new one.  I've heard of static sensitive machines, but to be
able to zorch something that badly in that way speaks volumes!

I'll stick with my bootleg Apple.  I built it, I debugged it, and I know how
to fix it.

Even though IBM *assembles* the PC, it's basically just another micro,
like a lot of others that various companies have cobbled together out
of off-the-shelf hardware.

And, working on the premise that anything that is humorous to somebody
is quite the opposite to someone else:  I wonder how funny Dave Barry would
find it if he (and the publications that publish his articles) knew that
we on the net readily and consistently violate his (and their) copyright
by reproducing those quite amusing columns.

I'll bet that if it were revealed that Dave Barry and New Shelter Magazine
were running copies of VMS or RSX software on their subscription list computers
and that they had got the copies "in the mail from a friend of theirs,"
we (and our Legal Department) wouldn't laugh very much at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I'll bet they wouldn't laugh much either, but I think copyright is
dead and just waiting to be boxed up and buried.

New forms of communication dictate new commercial realities.  And new
commercial realities dictate new laws.  The cassette recording and
videotape controversies are two more pieces of the same pie.  And what
about copying machines?

The copyright law as it stands is vague in the extreme, particularly
when faced with this sort of issue.  In the entire history of the
Supreme Court, only five copyright cases have been heard.  And, of
course, there's the whole issue of whether software can be copyrighted
or patented.

I say all the Dave Barry columns have been turned into software by
Digital employes by virtue of their binary encodement. Now what?

Subject: An interesting tidbit

Today's Wall Street Journal contains an article about "computerized
recruiting", and specifically mentions Connexions, a local outfit.
The following excerpt is interesting:

        One of Connexions' advertisers is Digital Equipment
        Corp., a computer maker based in Maynard, Mass.  William
        Baker, Digital's U.S. human resources manager [is this
        a fancy term for Personnel Manager? - sl], believes
        computerized recruiting "will evolve to be a major factor
        in the next two or three years."  He says "almost everyone
        in the computer industry has five terminals in a 20-foot
        radius."  Digital itself plans to post company job openings
        electronically by next year.  That will eliminate the delays
        that result from spreading the word by mail to numerous
        plants.

First of all, I thought that there was a freeze on hiring from the
outside?  If so, why are we advertising at all?  Second, although
you and I may have "five terminals in a 20-foot radius", I doubt
that the same is true of someone who is unemployed and looking for
work.  Even if the prospective job-seeker were employed, what would
his employer think about having company resources used for job-hunting?

I didn't say I was in favor of abolishing the apostrophe (Heaven forfend, as
Foodini the Magician used to say). In spite of its constantly being abused,
it still serves a useful purpose (moreso, say, than the exclamation point).
Better we should abolish that horde of seventh-grade English teachers who
persist in not teaching their students how to use it. Susan (my wife) finds
herself saddled with the impossible task of rectifying the wrongs of these
incompetent pedagogues, she being a teacher of secretarial science at a
community college. She counts it a major victory to have even one of her
students understand why "it's" is not the possessive form of "it." By the
time she gets these students, they've been committing sins like "Glady's"
for so many years they are irretrievably lost to grammar and punctuation.

On film processing:

Send a request to:

LustreColor
540 Turnpike Street
Canton, Massachusetts 02021

for their catalog, price sheet, and film mailing envelopes.

I have had good results from this outfit in all types of color
processing.  Their prices are slightly higher than Kodak and the
color quality slightly better.

Incidentally, ordinary slide-to-print processing does not produce
very good color results unless you find an outfit that does
Cibachrome prints (try looking in a popular photo magazine for
one).  The reason for this escapes me except that it's a problem
with the positive dye chemistry in the paper.

One way to get a good print from a slide (there are several, some
costing over $500!) is to request, from a processing outfit like
LustreColor, something called an inter-negative.  In essence,
they make a negative on special film from your slide and then use
this negative to make the print enlargement.  This costs about
$5.00 more (for the negative step).  Kodak may do this too, if you
request it.

Another way to get good prints from a slide is to shoot negative
film in the first place and have slides made from it.  Then
select the best slides and have prints made from the negatives
rather than from the slides.  This works rather well and you have
more options.  Kodak also does this, if you want.

Hope I was of some help.

Regards,

George

Subject: A delayed, but definitely alternate view of the DESPERADO-praised
         NBC Overnight News

This is the beginning of what might be a new genre.  You remember --
most of you are old enough, I imagine -- "straight news"?  That's
where Arch McDonald or someone equally real sat in front of a camera
and read news stories.  That was later eclipsed by "happy news," where
the actors who read words that more or less pertained to pictures of
burning buildings afterwards tried to makes jokes and prove to us that
they all really loved what they were doing, not to mention each other.

NBC Overnight now offers a new and different approach:  "smug news."

I've seen this show from its start, with co-newsreaders Lloyd Dobbins
and Linda Ellerbee.  And from their cutsie lead-ins, through their
clever introductions, to their news summaries "on a reel" and "on a
roll," all the way to their sign off ("And so it goes"), one thing
stands out -- these people think that they are quite clever, and are
very certain that we think they so, too.

To be sure, the team of Lloyd and Linda carried this smugness off with
style. The little smiles that flickered about their lips as they spoke
punny sentences, read snappy intros, or made fun of "viewer mail"
didn't infuriate in the beginning.  The literary allusions and zippy
writing sounded fine coming out of the mouths of two people who looked
and smirked the part.

But it all fell to pieces when Lloyd moved on to other projects, and
Linda won top billing and a curly-haired partner named "Bill
Schechner" (or maybe it's "Tom," and maybe I misspelled "Schechner".)
Poor Bill/Tom isn't clever.  I'd say that his uncleverness -- his
un-hip-ness -- is betrayed by the look on his face -- but it isn't,
because there is no look on his face.  This man has the blankest face,
the blankest eyes, I've ever seen on a human being.  It's not really
his fault, I'm sure, but when writers put smug lines meant to be
delivered with a smirk in this man's mouth, the effect is about the
same as a stenographer reading back the script of a Woody Allen movie.
 The stuff then sounds stupid, and you begin to feel that you're back
in the eighth grade and everyone's trying to sound cool and
sophisticated by using big words that they've read in the dictionary
but don't really understand.  And the sniping and smugness and
sniggering begins to wear, and you wonder why you aren't a normal
person sleeping soundly at this hour...

What's good about the show?  They often spend ten minutes or so
playing back uninterrupted news footage from other countries on
stories happening in the U.S., which provides a very interesting
outlook on how much American reporters color their reporting.  And
they every so often manage to find some interesting footage that
wouldn't have otherwise made it onto national TV. As soon as you get
all excited about that, they run the nth "animal story." They love
"animal stories."  They think that animal stories are cute. They think
that talking about the fact that they think animal stories are cute
is cute.

And that's the problem.  They think THEY are cute.  Very cute.

Too cute.  I'm going to bed right after David Letterman from now on.

An update, written a month after the above:  Stuffed animals.  Little
dolls.  Knick-knacks.  That's what they have on the desk in between
their twin typing tables.  The dolls are mostly on top of the books
lined up along the back of the desk -- the American Heritage, NYT
Manual of Style, that sort of thing -- but there is this little
stuffed thing that sits downstage center, staring straight at the
camera, smirking (of course).  It's probably there to fill in the
smirk pauses, the ones that happens when Bill and Linda can't smirk
themselves because they are reading massacre stories.

Bill -- his name is quite definitely Bill -- has been to diction and
reading-out-loud school this past month.  Now it looks like he's up to
the task of reading the teleprompter and speaking with minor
inflection at the same time.  His smirk needs work, though.  Lloyd
Dobbins, where are you when we need you?

Quick... Give me soap box.  [ Just got my second notice for IEEE dues... ]

I've decided not to renew my IEEE membership this year. Having to pay more
than seventy dollars for membership dues (per year) is only one very small
reason.

For some time now, I've been bothered by their attitude that real engineers
don't work for a living, but do research at leading universities.  My
roommate is an undergrad EE (a junior, I think) at ULowell, and he gets
"Potentials", the IEEE magazine for engineering students.  This month's
issue featured a lengthy article on the merits of being a full-time grad
student immediately after graduation.  The article mentioned how much more
you could learn by staying in school and how much more industry would want
you upon graduation.  In typical IEEE style, the article implied the most
honorable thing an engineer could do was stay in academia.

There is a conference taking place soon (sponsored by one of the IEEE's
special interest groups) whose theme is software *applications*.  All six
members of the comference committee are from leading universities.

There are a lot of engineers at DEC who don't have BSEE's.  They've proven
themselves through their work.  They've passed the Engineering Review
Board.  They know their stuff.  [They're often the same people that BSEE's
like me go to see when we're in over our heads.]  They are not allowed to
full IEEE members.

In one of the last publications I got from the IEEE, there was a little
eulogy with the headline "FATHER OF SILICON VALLEY DIES".  I expected to
read about Mr. Intel or Ms. Nationalsemiconductor or Leroy Motorola.
Instead, the piece commemorated the university professor (from Stanford?)
who persuaded either Mr. Hewlett or Mr. Packard to go into business.

Yes, I really believe more engineers should be persuaded to teach and do
research.  Yes, I really read some of the articles in SPECTRUM and
COMPUTER.  Yes, I want to know about engineering lectures and luncheons
taking place at area firms.

But I'd especially like to belong to a professional organization whose
interests are a little closer to mine.  I now get (for free) EDN,
Electronic Design, Computer Design and Mini-Micro Systems, all of which
have technical articles that are worth my spare time to read.  I also
glance through EE Times and Computer Systems News for the latest industry
rumors and (especially EE Times) articles exploring professional ethics and
pride.

Does anyone know of an alternate IEEE for PROFESSIONAL electrical and
computer engineers?  I'd love to join.

In response to the mail regarding 2/3 of our defense budget going for
people, not hardware...

I was listening to the Senate (one of the cable channels covers the
Congress) while they were talking about the military budget and
unemployment and the social welfare programs.  An interesting fact came
out - the number of people employed in the military is NOT included in
US employment figures.  I would guess that our unemployment figures
would look a little different if the military people were included in
the ranks of the employed.  These people should also be included in
any discussion of how much our country spends on training programs.
Most of the military employees have been trained in some way; many
have had college-level training.  Much of this training is usable
outside of the military, thus keeping ex-military folk off of our
welfare rolls.
