        An almost Norman Rockwell story.  On my morning walk I've been
        watching one house where about a year back they posted a big sign
        (evidently for their son) wishing him luck as he went into the army.
        Then, when he was sent to Saudi Arabia, the house blossomed with
        yellow ribbons.  A few weeks back there was a big banner welcoming
        him home,

        They've always had a flag on a permanent pole, but just recently the
        regular Stars &amp; Stripes has been replaced with a Desert Storm
        souvenir edition American flag with a huge Desert Storm logo with
        flashing jets and flaming tanks, like you've seen on T-shirts, and a
        sky-blue background.  When the flag is flapping, it looks like it's
        ripped, or has had paint spilled on it, or something.

        I was always a bit turned off by those Civil War regimental flags
        that had the name of the regiment embroidered on the bottom stripe,
        but this flag is way more offensive than that.  I mean, I know
        they're patriotic and they want to show it, but what would one of
        George Bush's unconstitutional flag laws say about this flag?  And
        how come Bush never talks about those laws anymore?  Maybe Dan "Mr.
        Gravitas" Quayle could go to work on this neglected area of public
        policy.

        Speaking of flags, and Flag Day, my first grandchild was born on
        Flag Day 1991, which will give a nice motif for her future
        birthdays.

        Her name is Lily and she's the daughter of David VAXUUM::
        Parmenter, a longtime contributor to Desperado and Jennifer
        Parmenter, who has never contributed, but who is known to many
        Desperados through her connections with Symbolics and Apple.

        She weighed 8 pounds 8 ounces and measured in at 21 inches and
        arrived in good order, with me and the little woman (Mrs.
        Desperado) fanning our  brows in the corner of the room and the
        other granny and Aunt Skye helping Jennifer bear down and midwives
        and nurses all over the place.  It was a scene that called for a
        Renaissance Dutch painter.

        We had a long spring in New England this year and lots of the
        summer plants came in early, including the day lilies, which
        bloomed June 13 as we were on our way to the hospital.  They had
        already thought about the name Lily, but the timing definitely
        helped them decide.

        When you have children you don't know anything, but when you have
        grandchildren (speaking from the expertise of a week's experience)
        you can take the time to be profoundly stirred.

        I was watching a documentary about the P51 Mustang, probably the
        greatest fighter plane of WWII (although the P38 Forked Lightning
        remains my personal favorite, not to mention the Hellcat).  This
        was a pretty conventional show using archival footage, canned rock
        music, and a radio announcer reading a script.  A typical
        Discovery Channel offering, in other words.  It started with the
        original development of the plane and then showed its use in
        various times and places in the war.  As the documentary arrived
        at the conquest of the Japanese home islands, the narrator talked
        about the role of the P51, including the casual acknowledgement
        that "all students of the era agreed" that the conquest was
        unecessarily brutal, that many civilians died unnecessarily,  and
        that the war was unquestionably won before any of this happened.
        The A-bombs weren't even mentioned. although obviously they made
        their contribution to the truth of the statement.

        This matter-of-fact remark would have gotten you tried for
        treason if you'd uttered it in 1945 and would have gotten you
        pilloried by politicians and the public press if you'd uttered it
        anytime between 1946 and say 1962, singled out as a softy and
        probably a Red, and yet, by 1991 it is acknowledged, accepted,
        well-known by "all students of the era".

        If we live in an information age, and we always say we do, maybe
        the experts will get their consensus together a little more rapidly
        on the small, medium, and large wars the US has participated in
        since then.

The second-most outrageous bumper sticker I've seen recently: a U.S.
flag on the left, and on the right something like "Flag Burners: Be
sure to leave your name and next of kin, so we can notify them after
we kill you.  This is PROMISE, not a threat!"

        If centuries of tradition are being overturned in Bulgaria and
        Soviet Georgia, if Manchuria is exploring capitalism and democracy
        and Spain is making dirty movies, if they're planning a Hard Rock
        Cafe for Albania,  who knows, maybe the United States will change
        in amazing ways as well.  Speaking for myself, I'd like to see a
        foreign policy that encourages democracy and entrepreneurship and
        a domestic policy that did the same.  As I was saying, it would
        mean major changes.  One party thinks the best way to benefit the
        poor is to give money to the rich and the other thinks the best
        way to benefit the poor is to give jobs to middle-class people who
        will give the poor what they need, so long as it isn't money (or
        not much anyway).

Subj:   now we REALLY REALLY don't need men... yay!
Subj:   today's humor...from Omni magazine

        In the film Sleeper, Woody Allen unknowingly walks into the
        ultimate sex machine - the Orgasmatron - and a little later
        emerges disheveled, but happy.  A genuine orgasmatron may
        materialize in the near future, says Milton Wolf, head of
        acquistions for the Getchell Library of the University of
        Nevada at Reno.

        Wolf, who has lectured at robotics conferences on these de-
        velopments, predicts that computer-induced sexual experiences
        will be commonplace within 10 years - thanks to pioneering
        work in virtual reality.

        People will hook themselves up to a virtual reality program
        similar to a flight simulator, call up their favorite sexual
        partner, establish their fantasy, and start going through the
        motions.  Users receive feedback from PC-linked biosensors
        attached to their bodies and sexual organs, resulting finally
        in orgasm.  "The evolution of man is going to be for many of
        us a relationship with our machinery that is extremely inti-
        mate," Wolf says.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I was strolling the grounds of Spit Brook, Digital's most beautiful site,
taking in the trees and flowers, bugs and birds and big green frogs when a
gang of folks strolled by discussing virtual reality and I thought "I'll
bet a virtual disk is a lot more like a real disk than any virtual reality
could be like this reality."

Little gas bubbles come up from the bottom of the pond.  The lily pads
have already grown to two inches wide.  Grackles are going after tadpoles.
Dragonflies are flashing cobalt blue.  And that's just a little bit of
what I can see.  Termites eat wood, but they can't digest it.  They have
specially adapted organisms who live in their stomachs and digest the wood
for them. There's one kind of creature that inhabits human eyelashes and
another that inhabits human eyebrows.   Reality is very active and full of
detail.  The granularity goes way down.  And way up too.  Galaxies spin
away.

Maybe "virtual" means "rude approximation for limited purposes", but that
doesn't change the meaning of "reality".

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to don the helmet and glove, but would it be
any "realer" than Dickens, or some Stone Age storyteller?

I don't know if I'd care to be a field-test site for whatever I'd have to
don to have a computer-induced sexual experience.  It would probably have
moving parts.  The interfacing and useability problems seem daunting.

While we're on the subject, the fans at Fenway have apparently taken to
bringing blow-up love dolls to ball games for those boring moments between
big innings.  I guess they got tired of the beach balls.  The ushers stab
the beach balls whenever they got near one.  Do they also stab the love
dolls?

Subject: Fearless leader missing something else?

Apparently at a news conference yesterday, the President's doctor
described George Bush's recent fatigue by saying he was kind of like
an eight-cylinder engine running on only six cylinders.  This calls to
mind the expression "not bangin' all eight", used to describe those
not meeting reasonable expectations for intellectual capacity.

How else might we describe George in his present condition?  Here's
some I can think of:

  "Two bricks shy of a load"

  "Elevator doesn't stop at all the floors"

  "A half bubble off plumb"

  "Lights are on, but nobody's home"

  "Left his groceries at the market"

  "Not playing with a full deck"

From:   DECWRL::"moon@cambridge.apple.com" "David A. Moon"
To:     jo@odi.com
Subj:   Re: two bricks shy of a load

I always thought "not firing on all eight" was invented by P.G.Wodehouse,
who used it to describe fatigue or hanged-overness rather than what
we might call in this context quaylitude.

Another variation I have heard was "no face cards in his deck."
I don't think "an hour late and a dollar short" means the same thing.

I think all the others I've heard were in your list, but surely as
computer weenies we can make up a few new ones:

  "running with a corrupted file system"

  "not booted off his hard disk"

  "no parity in his memory"

  "running with his garbage collector disabled"

  "punching with no cards in his hopper"

  "booted with /usr offline"

  "low on toner and jammed in Area 4"

and for any Multicians in the audience

  "running unintended (unattended) service"

Referring to the original subject line "Fearless leader missing something
else?", I highly recommend the song "Bush Lite" by Chris Chandler,
available on his self-published cassette tape "Stranded Musician Needs Gas
Out of Town". Call him at 617-492-3683 (that phone number is the only
"record label" information on the tape).  As an always polite person known
for his uniformly tasteful humor that never verges on bringing the blush of
shame to the cheek of modesty, I cannot say here just what it is that the
song suggests that our leader is missing.  But when he was the veep, Ronnie
sometimes let him borrow his clip-on when he went out in public.

Um, let's see, in Roget we find, among many others, witling, dizzard,
ninny-hammer, looby, hoddy-doddy, noddy, nonny, noodle, nizy, trifler,
pretty fellow (that would be the Veep), un sot ` triple htage, jobbernowl,
changeling, mooncalf, gobemouche, one who will not set the rivers on fire,
one who did not invent gunpowder, no conjuror, screw loose, tile loose,
slate loose, rats in the upper story.

Some more, bottom feeder, room-temperature IQ, drain-bamaged, pond scum,
Dan Quayle stand-in, poco loco, running with the cheese lice, strong as an
ant and twice as smart, too dumb to get arrested, Deputy Dawg's dumber
brother, dumber than a World War I general on the Western Front . . .

Surely you folks can send me some more.  "Out of toner and jammed in Area
4" is my favorite so far.

  Upon preparing for a recent trip into Quebec, I came
  across a French Phrase Book that no self  respecting
  English   speaking  tourist  of  a  French  speaking
  country should be without. Upon reading some of  the
  offerings,  I  immediately  thought  this would be a
  Desperado crowd pleasure (funny how the mind works).
  At  the very least I thought it would invoke tirades
  from  my  French   friends   about   some   of   the
  translations  and,  in turn, be worth a laugh; I can
  imagine a smart aleck "ugly American" using some  of
  these phrases.

  In  this  light,  I  submit  the  following  phrases
  extracted  from  "Wicked  French"  by  Howard  Tomb,
  published by Workman Publishing of New York, 1989:

  In Customs:
  -----------

  Bien sur, soyez le bienvenu pour reduire  ma  valise
  en miettes.
    (Of  course,  you're  welcome to tear my suitcase
     apart).

  Heureusement ce ne sont que des  valises  moches  de
  Louis Vuitton!
    (Lucky they're only tacky Louis Vuitton bags!)

  For Tiny Hotel Rooms:
  ---------------------

  Le lit est assez grande pour ma jambe.
   (The bed is big enough for my leg.)

  C'est une chambre pour un nain.
   (This is a room for a dwarf.)

  Toutes les chambres sont comme ca?
   (Every room is like this?)

  Y a-t-il tant de nains en France?
   (Are there so many dwarfs in France?)

  For The Clothing Store:
  -----------------------

  Cela aurait l'air extraordinaire.
   (This would look great.)

  Sur un extra-terrestre.
   (On an alien.)

  At the Louvre:
  --------------

   Facing the Mona Lisa:
   ----------------------

  C'est ca? Seulment suspendre au mur?
   (That's it? Just hanging on the wall like that?)

   Intelligent Comments About Art You Can Make Yourself:
   -----------------------------------------------------

  Les petits citrons  vert  de  Cezanne  vous  sautent
  pratiquement dans la bouche!
   (Cezanne's little limes almost leap into your mouth!)

  At the Restaurant:
  ------------------

  Le boudin noir est un peu trop lourd a mon gout.
   (Pig's blood sausage is just too rich for me.)

  J'ai mange du pate de merle puor aux dejeuner.
   (I had blackbird pie for lunch.)

  Je  reserve  la  lamproie  a  la bordelaise puor une
  occasion speciale.
   (I'm savin stew of blood sucking eels  for  a  very
   special occasion.)

  Sophisticated Wine Talk:
  ------------------------

  Ce Beaucastel rouge est calin et bien charnu.
   (This Beaucastel rouge is plump and amusing.)

  Quel superbe bouquet de noisettes et de sardines.
   (What a delightful aroma of hazelnuts and sardines.)

  Le Vouvray a des asperites mais il est sincere.
   (The Vouvray is pimply but forthright.)

  Ce vin a de la jambe.
   (The wine has great legs.)

  Mais il a la fesse fripee.
   (But its buttocks are wrinkled.)

  Le Chateau Montrose est une roulure sans gratitude.
   (The Chateau Montrose is an ungrateful bitch.)

  ------------------------------------------------

  On se tire, poupee.
   (Lets split, babe.)

        there was indeed a purpose behind the single and double blank
lines.
        it would be nice to have a mechanical elephant.  the walking machine is
a little too slow (well, ok, a lot too slow) for the base system for such
a beast, although the running machine might be ok when it's done.  the
finge, with a couple extra segments and a better grabber on the end
would do as a trunk.  big ears and a sily little tail present all sorts
of possibilities.

Hey, you could have an African and an Asian elephant.  The Africans are
big and square and intractable and the Asian are smaller, rounder,  and
easier to train.  And, of course, the decorative traditions of the two
regions where they're indigenous also offer many possibilities.  Tarzan
generally rode an Indian elephant in spite of his otherwise deep
commitment to African products.

  TALKSHOW: KQED radio announced a few days ago that due to lack of
funding, it was canceling its "Perspectives" commentaries. Next
morning, Doug Edwards was checking the call-in tape for listener
reaction and came across this from a women on her car phone: "My
name is Julia. Longtime listener. I'm very upset that you're canceling
'Perspectives' and I'm considering canceling my support. Please
reinstate --," followed by the sound of squealing brakes, a crash,
shattering glass, and Julia yelling "Oh s---, you've made me so mad
I just rear-ended the f---er in front of me. Have to go now." Click.
Poor Julia. Funds were restored, and "Perspectives" is back on the air.

Many New England readers will already have seen this, but I thought I would
send it in for the rest.

I just got my phone bill, and enclosed was a piece of paper that read

        Announcing...

                THE DEBUT OF NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE'S REVISED BILL

        This month, in an effort to help expedite our billing procedures,
        a few changes will be made in the appearance of your New England
        Telephone bill.

        The most significant change will be the elimination of the gold
        colored strip across the top of the New England Telephone Summary
        of Account page. This page will now appear like the others - it
        will have a light band of blue with a darker blue stripe across
        the upper edge of the page.

        Also, page titles, typed in black, will be located lower on the paper
        than in the past. In addition, the Summary of Account page will have
        the Total Amount Due boxed for easier reference.

        We hope these changes do not inconvenience you in any way. If you
        have any questions, please call your Service Representative.

It's a good thing this is Friday, so I can have the weekend to adjust. God,
I'm going to miss that gold strip!

I'm tempted to call my Service Representative to ask how these changes are
helping to expedite their billing procedures.

d. Squat above the surface, hold the mirror with both hands.
(2 people holding mirror, a hand near each corner)
e. Empty your mind of all thoughts and stare at the surface of the mirror.
(Gaze at the mirror intently without thinking about anything)
      GAZE FIXEDLY WITHOUT STARING
IMPORTANT: follow directions exactly in every detail.

32)Sculpt a comet into the likeness of Prince Henery the Navigator.

33)Art meets life: pouring water from the fridge into a glass.

how to use them, in a water tight container that won't corrode or leak
even after centuries of exsposure to salt water.
Bury this container as deep as possible under the sea floor.

45) collect all the responses to the origional posting and
all related postings. Print out the responses on green bar
computer paper. If you don't have enough paper, print them
two or three times, or just get some green bar that
has already been used. Suspend 7 foot sections of
the paper from the ceiling of a room (gallery) in a random
way so that the room is more or less filled with the
freely hanging swaths of greenbar. Calculate how many
trees gave up their lives for the paper. Multiply that
number by 12 and plant that many trees.

46). Watch a butterfly flap it's wings. Imagine the small eddies
of wind that it makes and imagine them causing a hurricane
that is never detected by the weather satillites.
(this was inspired by the posting about someone farting. The
poster of that article has the potential for a great career
as a conceptual artist, except that his work stinks.)

47) Purchase some crystals from the local new age spiritual book
store. Put the magic crystals back in the earth where they
belong. Make a map of where they are in the earth. Pray that

50)Make a pile of rocks resonate with youth and then tell them to eat
Socrates.
Call a lizard 'brother' and then place it upon those very same rocks.
Tape the dawn chorus on a reel to reel tape recorder (or ordinary).
Take the tape and strew it around the rocks with the lizard upon them
and sing "blind man" by the Buthole Surfers.

51)When you next pee into a urinal that flushes automatically, see
if the flush happens while your pee is in midstream. Note the
"wake" that is made by your urine as the water rushes down.
Imagine salmon swimming upstream. this is good luck when it happens.

52)Write "fire" with a thick black marker on a dollar bill.
Tape it to the exhaustpipe of a car somewhere and hang
out untill it's found. Try to remember the facial exspression
of the person as they find it and look around.
Write "earth" on another dollar. Hold it down somewhere by
putting some dirt on it. Hang out untill it's found. Try to remember
the facial exspression of the person as they find it and look
around. Simultaniously remember the first person.
Write "air" on a third dollar. Let it blow. Remember the facial
exspression of this person with the other two.
Write "water" on a forth dollar. Wet it. Wheen it is found remember
the persons facial exspression and the other three.
The next day try to remember all four faces as they found the
four dollars.
Be inconspicous.
Don't talk or write about it.
NO PHOTOGRAPHS.

53)DAYTWO: Take a dollar, Burn it.
Take another dollar, Make it into a paper airplane and fly it from
the highest place you can find.
Take another dollar, Bury it.
Take another dollar, Put it into a body of water.
DAY TWO: Burn two dollars, Fly two dollars, Bury two dollars,
Sink two dollars in a body of water.
DAY THREE: Three dollars
DAY FOUR: Four dollars
and so on, repeat as long as you can stand it.

54)Take a small pile of mulch, (there's a very large pile near ceramics)
about a cupful will do, pile it carefully in a damp place until it mold
grows. Hold the now moldy mulch up and blow the mold into the wind.
Dry the mulch, burn it and blow the ashes into the wind. This can be
accompanied by the chants of tibetian monks.

55)Place a pile of wet clay in front of an electric fan. Let the fan run
untill the clay dries and eventually blows away. This can be accompanied
by Jimi Hendrix's "Castles made of sand" played over and over until the
peice has disappeared.

56)Why don't you have the various media instruments interact with
signals produced by the other instruments.(from video, audio,
computers..whatever. if you have a video signal changing the
tune on a synthesizer...cool. whatever works).Start with, say,
the IIcx doing some fractals or something, have the video
inputting to a musical instrument, the instrument plays, and
the IIcx changes it's mandlebrot set for mathmatical
exploration...or something like that. Have it all interacting...
REAL TIME, with some randomness thrown in (like inputs from
an Infra Red diode, changeing the variables on the IIcx.
I,dunno, I was just thinking, why should the humans play the
music? Or edit the video? Or control the computers? Hell, hook
the IIcx to a wind-meter, and as the wind velosity and direction
change, so does the IIcx's computations.

57) drink as much water as possible every morning for seven days
 refrain from walking on concrete for 24 hours

All spelling and punctuation preserved.  I guess they're finished with this

I have three regrets in my life.  Here's one of them.  I was riding a
subway to Cambridge one day when the car was invaded by nine people all
dressed in bright red and carrying various household implements -- brooms,
telephones, spoons -- all painted bright red.  Their faces were made up
red.  It was part of a festival of performance art commissioned by the
trolley authority to celebrate the opening of some new stations.   They
stood there, striking various poses, but saying nothing.  It occurred to
me that, just as I was getting off the train, I could turn and speak out
in tones of Stentor:  "The problem with performance art is you can't tell
whether any particular thing is part of the art or not.  Is this speech
part of the performance art?"  Then I would turn and leave the train.  But
I didn't.  Hence the regret.

I must have said this somewhere before, but here I am saying it again:

     Performance art is to art as performance art is to performance.

Make up words using only the letters in the official abbreviations of the
states.  Turn to a friend and compliment them on their hairdo.  Claim to be
certain of something you're actually doubtful about.  Carry a surfboard for
a week.   Learn Japanese but tell no one.  Memorize every license plate you
see.  Do some trigonometry problems.  Tell everyone you know that the
nation of Ivory Coast has changed its name to Cote d'Ivoir.  Try to
remember if any of these suggestions were on the list you just skimmed
above.

a Pole, an American, and an Israeli.  He says, "Excuse me.  What is
your opinion of the meat shortage?"  The Russian responds, "Opinion?
What is this, `opinion'?"  The Pole responds, "Meat?  What is `meat'?"
The American responds, "Shortage?  WHAT shortage?!"  And the Israeli
responds, "`Excuse me'?!  What is `Excuse Me'?"

Subj:   Apple equivalent of (the old) Desperado

I saw a 2-page newsletter that apparently has been around for a few issues
called "Reality Check" that had some pretty good unfair but well-deserved
criticism of the company in it.  It's good to know that this type of thing
lives.  Being Apple, it was desktop-published rather than ascii emailed.

One thing they did that isn't company confidential is they took seriously
these little mailings one gets from time to time "I hope you will all join
me in congratulating Joe Blow on his new position as director of sales
for Madagascar" and in fact congratulated the people and reported on what
happened.  So figure 1 is pane a, "Typical announcement of promotion",
"blah blah blah", pane b, "Typical congratulatory message sent",
"blah blah blah", pane c, "Typical response from executive", blank,
and figure 2 is a table where the rows are different executives and
the columns are person's name, position promoted to, date of promotion,
date congratulations sent by email, date email message was read, and
date thanks were returned.  The last column is "never" in all ten cases.
There was also a terrific piece I can't tell you about on postponed
talks about new business directions.

Neat concept.  How about that for a computer industry fad?  Every time you
see a message saying that the sender hopes you will join him in
congratulating or wishing well in new endeavors some departing saint, send
the saint mail saying "I join &lt;G. Fetter Puthuff&gt; in wishing you well in
your new endeavors."

BTW, G. Fetter Puthuff is a real name.  I always wondered what the G. was for.

Seen at a discount store in Atlanta, Ga. (which one escapes me
now):

        A detailed, user friendly, VHS Video tape containing
        instructional material on how to operate your VCR.

(From the San Francisco Chronicle, Herb Caen, "Smatters of Fact")

..the Redwood City Price Club displays Ramses Extra Protection
Condoms in a box labeled "Family Size".

And, last, but not least, I hope all of the desperati celebrated
the 8th of May, International Outdoor Intercourse Day.  The cheer
appropriate to the day is:

        HOORAY, HOORAY, it's the 8th of May,
        outdoor f***ing begins today!

The wish for the day:

        "May the day be warm, the grass dry, and the spirit
         willing."

which seems an appropriate note upon to end.

Best,
