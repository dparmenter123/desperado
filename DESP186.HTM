        INTRODUCING COOKIES BURSTING WITH CHUNKY, BUMPY PERSONALITY
                   THE PEPPERIDGE FARM AMERICAN COLLECTION

        Only the bakers of Pepperidge Farm could pack so much scrumptious
        personality into classically American cookies.

        They began with timeless American favorites, like Chocolate Chip.
        Then they added a heaping measure of simple fuss and bother.

        That meant making each cookie one of a kind, with an individual
        personality all its own,  So they gave them rugged, irregular
        shapes, just as if someone had lovingly shaped each cookie by hand.

Subj:   Day in court

You know, I've read that the Justices of the Supreme Court are often heard
(by their clerks, I guess) complaining about the low quality of the
attorneys that argue cases before them.  Of course, the required level of
skill is higher in that arena, but the stakes are higher too, and the
Justices really prefer not to make important, precedent-setting opinions
when one or both sides of an issue have been presented weakly.

As I recently heard Jared Spool say: You know how dumb the average guy
is, right?  Well, half the poeple are even dumber than that!

Subj:   Desperado #2015: Illusions of Shameless Abundance

       And, in last week's Wall Street Journal, Nintendo stated that it is
       following a Trojan-horse strategy, very successfully.  Approximately 30
       per cent of all American homes have one of their computers in place.
       Good color graphics and sound, real-time response, and millions of
       trained users, all without a sign of Unix, and on an eight-bit machine
       built to be upgraded into a more obvious computer.

I've heard essentially the same argument, many times, applied to the
possibly-forthcoming proliferation of Japanese HDTV sets in the US.

By the way, there's a very interesting article in the latest New
Republic about the recent spate of new and proposed "industrial
policy" legislation, arguing that it protects American-owned
corporations, even if all their engineering and manufacturing is in
other countries, while discriminating against foreign-owned
corporations, even when they're employing Americans in the U.S.  It's
all anecdotal evidence rather than statistics, but it was interesting
to know that the only American TV company, Zenith, does essentially
all its work (engineering as well as manufacturing) in places like
Kuala Lumpur, while the only companies who are designing and
manufacturing TVs in the U.S. are Sony and Philips.  The article
argues that what the government ought to promote is training and
expertise of the people of the country, regardless of where the
company is incorporated.  It's by no means an airtight argument but
it's at least thought-provoking.

       My favorite standard is Adobe.  They did it their way and they make
       everybody buy from them and they don't give a damn what you think.

However, they are keeping prices high enough to invite competition.  We'll see.

       What ever became of the NeXt computer?

I actually saw one yesterday for the first time.  Yup, it blts bits
pretty fast.  But if you want to grow a window, it is unaccountably
slower than a Mac, almost Lisp machine speeds, and loading a program
can take a long time (I was always dubious of that optical disk).  I
know what your question really means, though, and I'd like to know too.

                                               Did they drown after the big
       splash?  And, speaking of second-go-round geniuses, how's tricks with
       ON?

They laid off about half their software engineers a while ago (with
much less fanfare than the founding of the company, needless to say).
Seems they decided to give up trying to make their own language,
database, operating system, etc, etc, and just do an application.  The
laid-off-ones (what's the word?)  said that they enjoyed working there
but felt that it was something of a sandbox, with no clear product
direction.  Otherwise the company's still closed-mouthed.

                              The Humble Dunny

         I think  it is not unfair to claim that Australians have some
         fundamental   pre-occupation,   obsession   or   fetish  with
         "dunnies".  ("Dunny"  is  not  a  terribly  polite term - one
         wouldn't  ask  for  the  whereabout  of the dunny at a dinner
         party  or  other  posh  turn.)  Perhaps  it is because of the
         humble  beginnings of the Australian toilet, or perhaps it is
         because those ramshackle outhouses that served the purpose in
         the  days  of  yore  still  render  faithful  service  today.
         Whatever the cause, the humble dunny stars in more Australian
         paintings  and photographs than any other architecture. It is
         a  formidable  contestant  to the gum tree, the koala and the
         kangaroo in its true Australian nature. You show me a picture
         of a dunny and I'll tell you if it's Australian.

         Whatever the  reason or origins, I know more funny (but true)
         stories  about  Australian  Dunnies than I do about any other
         topic  that  I  know with certainty to be truly Australian. I
         know  stories about redback spiders biting people's rear-ends
         in  dunnies.  I  know stories about people discharging loaded
         shotguns  at  occupied  dunnies.  I know stories about people
         falling  into  their  old (full) toilet pit in the process of
         moving  the shed to the new site of the dunny. I know stories
         about  dunnies  being  the  last standing monument to a house
         after a bushfire. I know stories about dunnies without doors.
         I  know  more Australian metaphors involving dunnies than any
         other topic. I know stories about the intricacies of emptying
         dunny  cans. I can draw more similarities between dunnies and
         life  in  general  than I can between life and anything else.
         All  because  I'm Australian and have reaped benefit from the
         culture.

         What follows is a synopsis of the farewell speech I delivered
         upon  my  departure  from Digital in Sydney. I hope you enjoy
         it.

         Before working  for  Digital  in  Sydney,  I worked for a CAE
         (College of Advanced Education) in Bendigo, Victoria. Bendigo
         CAE  Computing  Services  had  a single toilet for all of us,
         ladies and gents (which led to some interesting encounters in
         a  confined  space). While, the toilet door was not lockable,
         there  were  two  doors one had to pass through to get to the
         bowl  itself.  From  within the confines of the smaller room,
         one  could jam one foot against the door and listen carefully
         for  those  who might indicate their intention to invade your
         privacy  by  passing  through the first door. Loud whistling,
         screams,  and other human utterances (or the absence thereof)
         constituted the signalling system for toilet occupancy.

         In that  toilet,  there  was a toilet roll dispenser that was
         one  of  those  horrid  things  that  tries  to restrict your
         consumption  of  toilet  paper to one square at a time. (Some
         absurdly   creative   over-achieving   ex-software   engineer
         probably discovered that one revolution of the roll was equal
         to  one  toilet  paper  square dispensed, to a first order of
         approximation,  and  spent  years in search of an application
         for  the  discovery.)  I don't know anybody who has a genuine
         toilet-related  purpose  for a single square of toilet paper.
         Well,  nobody  I'd want to shake hands with, anyway. What was
         worse,  the  college  was  trying to cut down on expenses, so
         they  populated  all  toilet  roll dispensers with single-ply
         toilet tissue.

         When I  went  to  Sydney  to  interview  with  Digital, I had
         occasion  to  use a toilet. Mens' and womens' facilities were
         segregated  in  Digital,  Sydney  and  in my use of the mens'
         room, I observed that there were two toilets. Each had in its
         own  lockable  booth  and  the toilet paper dispenser was the
         same as the ones I have always used at home. That is, you can
         choose  to take the entire contents of the toilet roll if you
         think  your needs are great enough. Perhaps Digital had taken
         a  gamble  on  the  satisfaction of its employees and assumed
         that   disatisfied   employees   would  not  take  out  their
         frustrations  with the corporation by needless consumption of
         toilet  paper. Alternatively, they decided that the dedicated
         employee   would   seize   the  opportunity  to  madly  write
         extraneous ideas on the paper provided.

         What's more,  the  toilet paper was two-ply. I knew then that
         this  job  would  be  a  step  up.  At  the  relatively small
         sacrifice of those interesting encounters in confined spaces,
         I took the job. My satisfaction with segregation, privacy and
         infinite  toilet  paper  supply was short-lived, and, while I
         never  took  out  my  frustrations by consuming excess toilet
         paper,  there  wasn't  much more than that infinite supply to
         keep me in Digital in Sydney.

         When I  went  to  America  to  interview at Digital's at Spit
         Brook  Road  facility,  I also had occasion to use the toilet
         facilities   (Americans   call   them  "bathrooms"  to  avoid
         offending  the  innocent,  I  think) I was in for a surprise.

         Not only is a blackboard provided in each separate, lockable,
         segregated,  private booth, with adequate chalk (usually only
         one  colour  though), but, fastened to the wall in each booth
         is  a toilet seat cover dispenser. You operate a little lever
         on  the dispenser and out the bottom pops the beginnings of a
         disposable  (flushable,  no less) toilet seat cover. You pull
         on  that  tab  and arrange the cover on the toilet seat. When
         your visit is near completion, you flush toilet (I don't know
         the  American  euphemism for this activity - it doesn't arise
         in  conversation  terribly often). There is a tab on the seat
         cover  that  actually  hangs  down into the water. When water
         starts  to  swirl  around the bowl (as water does in American
         toilets,  for  a  reason  I  am yet to fathom) the disposable
         cover   gets  caught  up  in  the  currents  and  eddies  and
         disappears  along  with  everything  else. It was then that I
         knew that I would work here.

                        HOW TO THINK ABOUT CHINA

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

The Chinese government announced that no one was killed in Tiananmen Square
in Beijing.

The only good feeling remaining about the Chinese democratic movement is
that the events of April and May prove that oppressed people do understand
what democracy is about and forty years of announcements like that and deep
training in the evils of "bourgeois" values (built on top of three or four
thousand years of looking at things in quite a different way) haven't
worked.

This month's events in Hungary and Poland are still encouraging, but plenty
of Hungarians and Poles have been killed in this century.

Alan Dershowitz, lawyer-columnist (and Alan Dershowitz fan) called a bunch
of prominent left-wing organizations and individuals for comments on the
Tiananmen massacre.  Most of them were "unavailable for comment", but a
few stepped bravely forward:

    William Kunstler:  "No comment."  (Kunstler says he doesn't ever
    criticize "socialist" regimes for fear of supporting "red baiters".)

    Noam Chomsky: "No comment."  Chomsky describes himself as "defender of
    the underdog".  Bow-wow.

    The PLO: "It is an internal problem.  We are not going to get
    involved."

    The Nation:  (Paraphrase of comments printed before the massacre.)  The
    student movemnt vindicates "Gorbachev's main thesis" rather than
    "imported Western values".  Funny, I thought I heard them talking about
    Abraham Lincoln and Patrick Henry and Martin Luther King, and was that
    a Russian statue they were carrying?

    National Lawyers Guild:  The Chinese situation is "too complex and
    fluid" for immediate comment; they need "more information and
    discussion".

It's so nice not to have an ideology, to be able to condemn cruelty and
tyranny as it rises, without having to wait for approval from the central
board of thinkers.

What follows has been pretty widely circulated, but I think everyone should
get a chance to see it.  There have been some dubious bits of
multi-forwarded, misattributed network sendings in the course of the
glories and horrors of China in the past few weeks, but this rings true.

I wish it didn't.

                            CAI LING'S REPORT

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Translation of the full transcript of a tape made by Cai Ling,
leader of the student movement on June 8 as published in a Hong
Kong paper: Oversea's Chinese Economic Journal.  Cai Ling was
sobbing as she was doing the recording.

------

June 8, 1989, 4 pm.  I am Cai Ling, Supreme Commander of Defence
of Tiananmen, I'm still alive.
    On the evening of June 3, between 8, 9 and 10, the situation
got worse and worse.  News of people being beaten to death kept
coming in, more than ten times.  Our Command issued a statement,
our only slogan: Down with Li Peng government.
    At 9 pm sharp, all the students at Tiananmen stood up, raised
our right hands and swore, " I pledge that for the cause of
developing democracy in our motherland, for the prosperity of our
country, to prevent a small group of conspirators from
undermining out great motherland, to prevent our one billion
population from white terror, I pledge our young lives to the
defence of Tiananmen, to defend the republic.  Our heads may be
cut off, our blood may be shed but we will not allow the loss of
people's square.  We will defend to the last with our lives."
    After 10 pm, our command told everybody that since April,
when the movement was mainly that of a patriotic student
movement, and into May when the movement turned into a people's
movement, our principle has always been peaceful demonstration.
The highest principle of our struggle is peace.  A lot of fellow
students, workers, citizens of Beijing came to our command post
and said this was not the way to conduct the struggle, you should
take up arms and some of us were quite agitated.  Our command
said to them, we are here for peaceful demonstration, the highest
principle of peace is to sacrifice ourselves.  That's how we
were, we linked hands, shoulder to shoulder, we came out of our
tents, we were singing the Internationale and we set on the steps
of the monument, peacefully.  With our peaceful eyes, we awaited
the arrival of butchers, we knew we were conducting a war between
love and hate, not a war between arms and violence.  We all knew
that this democratic peaceful movement has peace as our highest
principle and we didn't want it to end with fellow students using
sticks and bottles to fight those armed with bayonets, tanks, the
soldiers who had lost their senses, that would be the greatest
tragedy of our movement.
    We were just sitting there quietly, waiting to sacrifice
ourselves.  Then our loudspeakers played "Descendants of Dragon",
fellow students were singing along with tears in their eyes, we
were holding on to each other, we held hands.  Each of us knew
the end was here, the time to sacrifice our lives for our people
was here.
    There was a young student, he was 15 and he wrote his last
testimony.  I can't remember his exact words, I only remembered
one thing he said to me.  He said, "Life is strange, there is
only a fine line between life and death, sometimes I see a worm
crawling along, when it moves a little, it will get trampled on
and will never move again."  He was only 15 and he thought about
death.  Republic, please remember, this child fought for you.
    Between 2 and 3 am, we had to abandon the public address
system at the bottom of the steps and moved up to the one on the
monument itself.  Those of us in command went around the monument
to comfort our fellow students and to mobilize them.  We were
just sitting there.  Some said, the first row was most
determined,  fellow students in the back row said they are just
as determined, if the first row got attacked we would not run
away.  I told them a very old story.  "There was an ant hill with
one billion ants.   One day the hill was on fire, the ants
realised that they must get through the fire if they were to be
saved.  So some of the ants held together and rolled towards the
fire, those on the outer edge were burned to death but the rest
of the ants lived.  Fellow students, we are on the square, we are
standing on the outer edge of our people."  Each of us understood
that only through our sacrifice could we save the republic.  We
sang the Internationale.
    Later, several compatriots, He Dejian and others on hunger
strike said they couldn't bear it.  They said, "Kids, don't
sacrifice yourselves here?"  But we students were very
determined.  Some went to seek out the army to negotiate, to find
someone who was responsible for "cleaning up the square" and
offer to leave the square peacefully if our safety were
guaranteed.
    At this time, our command were soliciting the opinion of
students whether to stay or to leave.  It was decided that we
should leave.  But while we were preparing to retreat, those
butchers did not keep their words.  The soldiers in helmets and
with bayonets came charging up the monument, before we could
announce our decision to retreat.  They destroyed our speaker
system and defaced the monument.  It's people's monument, how
could they shoot at the monument.
    The rest of the students were retreating, we were crying,
fighting.  Some citizens told us not to cry, we said we'll be
back, because this is the people's square.  But we learned later
that some students still believe the government and soldiers
would not hurt them, they thought the worst case would be to be
forcibly taken away.  They were too tired and were sleeping in
tents, the tanks made meat pies out of them.
    Some said two hundred or so students had died.  Some said
over four thousand died in the square.  The actual figure I still
don't know, but those on the outer edge, those belonging to the
autonomous workers union were all dead, they had at least twenty
to thirty people.  I heard when students were retreating,
soldiers in tanks and APC's put abandoned tents, clothes and
students' bodies together, poured gasoline over them and set them
on fired.  Then they washed the grounds and not a trace of
evidence was left.  The symbol of our democratic movement - the
goddess of liberty was ran over by a tank and broke up into small
pieces.  We linked hands, went round Chairmen Mao's Memorial Hall
towards the west and saw about 30,000 armed soldiers, many
students cried "Dogs, fascists".
    The soldiers were heading towards Tiananmen.  We passed
Liubuko, member of our command were in the first row.  On the
afternoon of June 3, Liubuko was the site of one of the first
bloody battles, debris, trash cans, burned out were everywhere.
We went from Liubuko to Chang An Blvd.  We saw burned out
vehicles and broken cobble stones, obviously a fierce and bloody
battle was fought there but there was not one body around.  We
learned later that the fascists were mowing people down with
machine guns, the soldiers coming from the back would pick up the
bodies and put them on buses or trolleys.  Some of them might
still be alive when picked up and must had suffocated to death
among all the bodies.  These fascist covered their crimes well.
    We were marching back to the Square.  The citizens of Beijing
tried to turn us away.  "Kids, do you know they have machine guns
set up?  Don't sacrifice yourselves!"  We then left through Xidan
to retreat to our campus.  On the way, we saw a mother crying out
loud, her kid was dead.  I could see from the body that it was
killed by soldiers and laying on the street.  I continually
received reports that people got shot.  These citizens didn't
commit any crime, they didn't even shout slogans.
    A friend of mine told me, he was trying to stop tanks in
Chang An Blvd around 2 am.  He saw with his own eyes, a girl not
very tall, with her left hand on her hip and her right hand
waving and stood in front of a tank.  She was ran over and became
a meat pie.  He was holding a fellow student each with his left
and right hands.  His friend on his right was shot and fell, then
his friend on his left was also shot and fell. He was lucky to be
alive.  On the way back, we saw mothers looking for their kids,
wives looking for their husbands and teachers looking for their
students.
    The machines guns all round had banners on them, "Support the
correct decision of the Party Central Committee".  Students were
greatly angered by this banners and tore them down.  The radio were
saying the army was in Beijing to take care of the rioters, to
maintain the order of the capital.  I think I'm most qualified to
say that students were not rioters.  Every Chinese with
conscious, put your hand on your heart, think about it, the kids
were holding hands, sitting by the monument and waited for the
arrival of butchers.  Are these rioters?  If they are rioters,
would they be sitting there quietly?
    How far has fascism gone?  Shamelessly, against their own
conscious and they telling the biggest lies.  If the soldiers
who mowed down innocent people are animals then what are those
lying in front of cameras?
    As we were leaving the Square and on Chang An Blvd, a tank
was charging our way.  It fired tear gas.  It ran over students,
over their legs, their heads.  Many were could not die in one
piece, who are the rioters?
    It was like this, our fellow students leading in front, we
maintained our pace, it was like this.
    Fellow students were wearing masks, the tear gas made our
throats really soar and painful.  For those who have already
sacrificed their lives, what would bring them back.  They would
forever echoed on Chang An Blvd.
    Those of us who walked back from Tiananmen, those who were
still alive came back to Beijing University.  There were many
students from other campus and other cities, we had prepared beds
for them.
    We were in deep sorrow.  We were alive.  But there were many
more who stayed at the Square, stayed on Chang An Blvd.  They'll
never come back, never.  Some of them were young, very young,
they'll never be back.  Afterwards, we got information related to
June 3.  At 10 pm, Li Peng gave three orders.  First, the
soldiers could shoot.  Second, the army must move will all haste
and they must win.  By the morning of June 4, they must totally
recover the Square.  Third, the leaders and organizers of the
movement are to be killed at will.
    Compatriots!  The ruthless and insane 'puppet' government are
still moving the army around.  A massacre is going on in Beijing,
perhaps a massacre is also going on in other parts of the
country.  But compatriots, the darker it gets, the sooner will
dawn arrive.  When the fascists are pursuing senseless crack
down, then a real people's and democratic republic is to be
borne.
    A critical life and death situation has arrived for our
country.  Compatriots, every citizen who has conscious, every
Chinese, awake!  The final victory belongs to civilians.  The
'puppet' Central Committee leadership of Yang, Li, Wang and Bo is
not far from destruction.

    Down with Fascism.
    Down with Military Rule.
    People will triumph.
    Long live the republic.

Long live the republic.  People will triumph.  Down with Military Rule.
Down with Fascism.  And you can have Noam Chomsky, William Kunstler, The
Nation, and the National Lawyers Guild.  I do not believe you would have
found I.F. Stone among such pusillanimous pissants.

Cai Ling's title is apparently incorrectly translated.  Here's an
authoritative correction.

    "Supreme Commander of Defence of Tiananmen" is probably a mis-
    translation.  There is no word "defence" in the title in Chinese, in
    the transcript published in one Hongkong newspaper.  Does anyone have a
    tape of the broadcast?  "Wo shi TianAn Men guangchang zhihuibu zong
    zhihui."  Literal translation: "I am(was) Tiananmen Square directing-
    department chief director"   Other translations for "zhihui" as verb or
    noun include "conduct(or)."

Subject:  "Huh?"

Desperado #2015, which seems to come from you, contained
a press release by Richard M. Stallman.  He ended the
release with the typical "30" (or "xxx"), but he wrote
it in hexidecimal, as "1E".  There was a question, which
you may have asked or seen, as to whether "1E" and "xxx"
were the same thing.  The hex-to-Roman table answers
that question, as well as about 69 others.

You may use the table for whatever purpose occurs to you.

On a different, but vaguely related matter ...  Should you,
in a fit of madness, require the details of a base-three
number system, I can supply it.  It has the unusual property
that you negate numbers by rotating them about the
horizontal axis.  I'm sure that fellow Desperadi who have
no interest in mathematics would be bored to death.

41 lxv           The number "-30-" or "30" or "xxx" has been
42 lxvi          used by generations of news reporters to indicate
43 lxvii         the end of a story.  Some people have many theories
44 lxviii        to explain this number.  Others think the answer is 2A,
45 lxix          but they're wrong.  It isn't the answer; it's the
46 lxx           error code.

So, there you have it, 1E *is* 30 in hex, which generations of Desperadoes are
accustomed to seeing at the bottom of each issue in the form xxx.

Digital Standard Runoff supports upper-and-lower-case octal Roman numerals,
in case you ever need any.
