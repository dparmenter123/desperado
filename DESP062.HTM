Inscribed on the *edge* of the new British pound coin, on top of the

The new one pound coin (much smaller than the old British penny) has a motto
around the edge which I think means:

        Digital makes the best computers for ancient Egypt.

I hereby announce the Relief Fund for Ex-System Managers.  This fund will
gratefully accept contributions to provide relief for that system manager
who has recently retired from the nerve-frazzling, hair pulling, sleep
depriving, sanity destroying job of dealing with yo-yo vaxes, ignorant
users, mid-afternoon game players, DMC-11s, Field Circus Clowns, managers
who like system privileges, and other scuzzy, crawly things that live under
rocks.

The purpose of the Fund is to provide relief in the form of beer (LOTS of
beer), shelter (at the Copley Plaza Hotel--I don't like the gold braid on
the caps of the doormen at the Ritz), and entertainment in certain Washington
St. clubs (the identity of which will be disclosed only after the payment
of a to-be-determined disclosure fee).

Contributions will be accepted in all forms, as long as it's cash (and in
small bills, please).  Kruggerands will be reluctantly accepted, but are
discouraged (have you ever tried to spend a Kruggerand in the Combat Zone?).
Contributions should be sent to:

Should you want a reciept (for tax purposes, of couse), please enclose a
stamped, self-addressed envelope.  Receipts are contingent on obtaining
non-profit status from the IRS, so don't hold your breath.

I would like to take this oppurtunity to thank in advance all you kind-

I was recently in Key West, Florida where I spent an afternoon poking
around art galleries and sponge markets. It seems that Key West has a
resident philosopher, Captain Tony (he is also a fisherman). Captain
Tony's bearded face, along with his favorite sayings, appear on many
picture posters of the Keys. My two favorites are:

(Captain Tony peering off towards the sunset; a woman's nude body
superimposed on the sun)

        "The sex drive gets greater as you reach the equator"

(Captain Tony superimposed over the picture of a sailboat)

        "All you need in life is a healthy sex drive
         and a big ego. Brains don't mean shit."

I returned to Massachusetts once again convinced that we live in a great
country.

        Arkedelphia, Ark.(AP) A 55-year-old widow is to serve a seven-day
sentence at the local Holiday Inn for driving while intoxicated. Local
jails do not meet state standards for housing women; and Arkansas' new
drunken driving laws call for a mandatory jail sentence. It would
cost the Arkedelphia police department $630 to house the woman in the
nearest (compliant) jail.

I was fortunate enough to attend an exhibitors' preview of "Superman III"
this past weekend.  If you're a fan of these films (and be honest with
yourself -- when the temperature and humidity both soar over 90 this July,
are you really going to quibble about plot and characterization?  Don't be
silly), you'll definitely like this third installment, which was directed
entirely by Richard Lester, and which stars, in addition to Christopher
Reeve, Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang, Robert Vaughan as the evil (pronounced
ee-vilh) Ross Webscoe, and Richard Pryor as Gus Gorman.  Margot Kidder, who
was almost written out of this one, makes only cameo appearances.

Lester's work includes "A Hard Day's Night," "The Three Musketeers," "The
Knack (and How to Get It)", "The Ritz," "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Forum," and part of "Superman II."  He's an outstanding film-maker,
in my opinion, and does a pretty good job with this movie.  The first half
or so is fast and often funny, which is to say vintage Lester.  The second
half gets somewhat bogged down, unfortunately, due to the grim way Superman's
latest personal crisis is portrayed.  The movie becomes somewhat schizophrenic
at that point, which is a shame, because large parts of it are marvelous.

It wouldn't be entirely accurate to say it's a "Richard Pryor film," but
there's no doubt the movie revolves around his character.  Pryor is quite
good, although he doesn't break any new ground.  Reeve and O'Toole make a
nice couple.  And, of special interest to DESPERAOs, much of the plot
revolves around computers.

All in all, I give it 3 capes.  If you see it with an emptier bladder than
I did, and are further unencumbered by the presence of two loud and stupid
people immediately behind you, you may enjoy it even more than I did.

And a special tip o' Clio's hat to British Airways and their ad agency for
their new ad campaign.  The first commercial, in which they show graphically
how many people they fly per year, is an outstanding combination of parts of
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and James Blish's saga beyond the stars,
"Cities in Flight."  Even looks good in 12" B&amp;W.

The federal Drug Enforcement Administration has requested Vermont
real estate brokers to inform them whenever rental clients fit a
"profile" of possible drug dealers or smugglers.

According to the DEA, "The renter/purchaser or 'front person' is usually
a male between the ages of 22 or 32 years.  This individual is well-dressed,
from out-of-state and representative of an affluent life style.  This indi-

     This past Sunday night, May 15th, I was able to attend the PHC Roadshow
     performance that has made its way to the east coast.  I was able to get
     tickets thanks to the telephone system, plastic money, and the slow
     response of New Yorkers to snap up the tickets to this fine show.
     We ended up with seats in NY's Town Hall (not City Hall, and I don't
     know the history behind the name) that were in the upper balcony,
     (a.k.a. the stratosphere) about 4 rows from the back.  The view of the
     stage was fine, since the slope to the upper balcony approached that of
     an A-frame roof!!  The show was started at 8:00 PM SHARP!! (Radio
     discipline, I guess) and featured the following regulars from PHC:

                Garrison Keillor (of course)
                The Butch Thompson Trio (himself, Bill Evans and Red Maddock)
                Stoney Lonesome (a seven or so piece bluegrass group)
                   I can't keep track of 7 people's names in one band!!
                Peter Auschrusko (string player quite good!!)
                  (Splelling??)
                And Greg Brown, folksong writer (Slow Food, The Iowa Waltz)

    The first half of the performance alone was nonstop, with the action
    shifting smoothly from one player to the next for better than an hour; and
    to see how much effort these people put into the performance was quite
    amazing.

    The show, though not broadcast, was taped, for possible broadcast at a
    later date, and the demeanor was one of a live radio braodcast. I was
    quite pleased to see Garrison himself, in his cream-colored suit, red tie,
    and white shirt.  He really does walk and talk, and does not merely stare
    out from the backs of album covers.  I found it somewhat surprising that
    for certain portions of the show Garrison just stands onstage, hands in his
    pockets, and sort of taps his feet to the music.  Many high points to the
    show...Red Maddock doing the "Clouds of Joy" Bubblebath commercial, the
    Stoney Lonesome singers doing "Answer your phone", a promo for the phone
    company, to the tune of "Praise the Lord, I saw the light", but
    probably the best was "News from Lake Woebegone", where Garrison, standing
    alone onstage spun a yarn for better than 30! minutes, with the whole
    audience hushed.   The basic theme was "Reliability, why you don't want it,
    especially when its something you don't want to come around (like exams,
    chorale practice, etc.)".  The tale ranged into hopes for signs of the
    first warm day of sping in Minnesota, wanting to sing in a church with a
    choir, not wanting to sing all by yourself in chorale practice, at least
    not in front of EVERYBODY.  Problems with being 13 years old, and being
    told to sing about, "Septmember is in my mistress' bosom," and not being
    too knowledge able about either, and quite curious to maybe sort of know
    a little more about both (i.e. mistess' and/or bosoms).  The most striking
    moment was when Garrison started to sing the refrain from the schoolkids'
    modified "battle hymn of the republic",

                Glory, Glory, How peculiar,
                Teacher hit me with a ruler,
                So I bopped her on the bean
                With a rotten tangerine,
                And she ain't gonna teach no more..

   Not so much that he sang it, but the whole audience joined in, and they
   knew it to the same lyrics !!  (is this one a schoolkids classic?)

   Other nice thoughts from the performance:

        The audience was VERY well-behaved (perhaps the shy people were an
                influence).
        With the program, they handed out a copy of Minnesota Public Radio's
               WIRELESS catalog, wich lists all the PHC goodies you can buy;
               at FAR less than the $$90.00 WGBH asks for an album..
        Also, an advace order form for the paperback version of "Happy to be
        Here", Garrison's book, as well as the 1983 PHC Tour album, when
        released.

        The greatest irony was the location of the theater; Town Hall is
        located on 43rd street near Sixth Avenue, one block north and east
        of Times Square.  An unusual juxtaposition: Sleaze, gore and basic
        obscenity a block away, and we had a packed house listening to some
        good bluegrass and folk music, dry humor, and story telling.  As Pete
        Seeger announced at GEAR-UP '81, the eastern bicyclists rally in New
        Paltz, NY; "A thousand peole gather here in the country to go out and
        ride bicycles.  Maybe there's hope for this world yet."

                                        Heaven's, they're tasty!

                    SEARCHING FOR A SUPERCOMPUTER

          A group of scientists is about to launch America's
          first   non-commercial   program   to   develop  a
          supercomputer   --   one   that    will    perform

          advanced   models.    The    Lawrence    Livermore
          Laboratory,  the  Los  Alamos National Laboratory,
          and a California think tank called SRI are teaming
          up  to  form  SPREAD:   the  supercomputer project
          research experiment in advanced development.   The
          challenge in building a supercomputer is finding a
          way to coordinate several high-speed computers  so
          that  they  can  work  on the same problem without
          interfering with each other.  Using  four  Digital
          Equipment  Corp.   computers  wired  into the same
          memory bank, SPREAD will explore the effectiveness
          of  different  operating systems and languages.  A

          similar  research,  as  are  a  number of Japanese

Yesterday's WSJ has an article that seems prompted by the agreement made between
Stewart Brand and Doubleday for "The Whole Earth Software Catalog" to be
published in July 1984.  I'm sure this will be run along the traditional Whole
Earth lines with the exception that "real" salaries will be paid to the
editorial staff, as much as $30,000!!!  So if you want to write about software
products here's your chance to earn "nominal" fees or if you know of a really
neat software product here's the chance to promote it.  Or if you are really
interested in editing and researching personal computers, here's a slim chance.

Amdahl Corp. is deliberating on whether to make a public product

Aspen are written in the IBM instruction set. The operating system
