Subj:   Happy Birthday!

I'm guessing that "tomorrow" is August 4th?  Here's a few other
things that happened on that date ('sides WWI)...

    1693 -- Champagne is invented by Dom Perignon
    1755 -- b. Nicolas-Jacque Conte, Inventor of the modern pencil
    1790 -- United States Coast Guard founded
    1875 -- d. Hans Christian Anderson
    1914 -- Britain declares war on Germany, US declares her neutrality
    1921 -- b. Mitchell Herbert "Herb" Ellis, McKinney, TX, Guitarist
    1947 -- b. Rick Derringer (orig. Zehringer), Guitarist, Vocalist
    1962 -- b. Roger Clemens, ML Baseball Player

Happy birthday!

Nice crowd of Leos.  Herb Ellis is the bluesiest of modern jazz guitarists and
Rick Derringer led the hottest of the talk-show bands, the Off Broadway Band
on Lifetime Cable channel.  (I contemn Paul Shaffer.)

"I love long walks, particularly when taken by people who annoy me."

                                        - Oscar Wilde

                                    =*=

        One need not have read "Lady Chatterly's Lover" to find something
        shocking to the PMRC in this grand old song.  Everybody sing!

                        WHEN YOU WORE A TULIP

                              Key of A

                When you wore a tulip, a big yellow tulip
                And I wore a big red rose
                When you caressed me
               'Twas then heaven blessed me
                Such a blessing no one knows
                You made my life cheery
                When you called me dearie
               'Twas down where the blue grass grows
                Your lips were sweeter than julep
                When you wore a tulip
                And I wore a big red rose.

        I found this in an old songbook from a tavern called "Jim's Place"
        in Put-in Bay, Ohio.

        Speaking of grand old songs, the State of Connecticut has adopted
        "Yankee Doodle Dandy" as their state song.  But where Yankee
        Doodle was originally abjured to "mind the music and the step and
        with the girls be handy", the version officially approved in
        Connecticut reads "with the folks be handy".  This is an insult to
        us all, particularly our colonial girls.

Being politically correct has its occasional problems
For instance, this correction in the July 21 Fresno Bee,
reported by John Hughes: "An item in Thursday's Nation
Digest about the Massachusetts budget crisis made
reference to new taxes that will help put Massachusetts
'back in the African-American.'  The item should have
said 'back in the black.'"

Subj:   Flagging the dog

More info on the flag code than you ever wanted...

Actually the code caught up with the electricfication of the U.S. of A.
sometime in the 1970's, now you may fly a flag after sundown if it
is illuminated.  The capital is not the only place in the U.S.
where the flag can be flown after dark (and now w/o illumination...)

By tradition, the flag was also allowed to be flown in the plaza in
Taos, New Mexico at night.  Although I am a bit foggy on the details,
I think this tradition stems from an all-nighter involving Kit Carson
(or was he at the Alamo?) and a bunch of attacking indians.  Kit boldly
ignored the U.S. flag code during this scirmish, and kept the flag up
as a sign that he had not given up.  Early the next morning, the calvary
arrived to take names and numbers, and generally make sure that this country
would be free to elect ex-movie stars to the presidency...

I would not have come to this amazing info, except that my parents
owned a small clothing shop just off of the plaza several years ago.
The town was overrun at the time with loud Texans whose appendages
were weighted down with large pieces of ugly gold jewelry.  My parents
thought they were all well off from the oil bisness, but I guess we
now all know that they were more likely spending money aquired from
their local S&amp;L.

&gt; Or the flag the size of two football fields that Ronald Reagan
&gt;dedicated a few years ago, designed to be displayed lying on the ground!

Not egg-zacko-lilly...  Actually, the flag in question was made in my
hometown of Evansville, Indiana (Yeah!) by a bunch of little old
ladies at a uniform factory.  It was to be hung from the
Verra-something Narrows Bridge in NY, as a "welcome home" gesture for
the American hostages released from Iran.  Said stars and stripes were
first displayed laying on (not the ground) the hardstand (concrete, no
less) at the Dress Regional Airport in E'ville.  Now you know the rest
of the story (or more than you ever wanted to know).

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Ack-sho-eggo-zackly, there were two (or more) big flags.  Both were
displayed on the ground.  The two-football-field one I mentioned, and now
this one designed for the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge.  When they picked the
bridge flag  up off the concrete and finno-zackly hung it from the bridge
itself the flag flapped so hard in the winds it ripped itself to shreds
the first day.

So, when they upgraded the flag code, did they eliminate the requirement of
displaying the flag from the radiator cap on automobiles?

&gt;He's already the most plagiarized writer since Max Ehrmann (quiz time:
W&gt;hat did Max write?),

That's EASY!  "Desiderata".  Commonly said to be "found in Old St.
Paul's Church in Baltimore, dated 1692", or something like that.  Max
published it in 1928.  I found this gem in high school, when my
literature teacher, Clifford Nelson, and I wrote to the church.  They
sent the history of the poem, including its misquoted origins.  Mr.
Nelson was known to his students as "Chappie", and was a character
equal to our own Mr. Parmenter!  Example: When Chappie was in the Air
Force, he had a reputation for leaving formation to shoot down flocks
of geese with his guns...until he came back once with the leading
edges of his wings covered with large dents.

Subj:   CACTUS, SINGLE, PLURAL, WHATEVER

Found the following in "The Secretary's Handbook" published by Macmillan.

"Many nouns retain their foreign plurals for formal and scientific
material and use the English plurals in nontechnical or informal writing."

cactus-cacti-cactuses
fungus-fungi-funguses
gladiolus-gladioli-gladiioluses

So both cacti and cactuses are correct.

I'm glad to see that the "Handbook" reached the same conclusion that the
Desperado Grammer Club reached, but I still say "cactuses" is comfortable
and "cacti" is prickly.

   Knock, knock.
   "Yes?"
   "You Melville?  H. Melville?"
   "That's right.  The 'H' is for 'Herman.'"
   "Yeah, well, lookahere, Herman, my name's Dowd.  With the National
Endowment for the the Arts?  Formerly with Sen. Helms' office?  I come to
talk to you about this here book you hope to get a grant for."
   "I must say, I'm a bit surprised to receive a personal visitation."
   "We only visit what you call your borderline cases.  And that's what you
are, Herman.  A borderline case.  I wanna talk to you about this book to
see if we can clear up the concerns the NEA's got."
   "Well, of course.  Do come in."
   "Good.  Now, let's get down to cases.  First off, this hero of yours.
This Ishmael.  That a Jew name?"
   "Well, it's certainly Old Testament, although Ishmael is Presbyterian."
   "That was a real good answer, Herman.  Let me write that down.  A lotta
good Christian taxpayers might not be real happy supporting a book they
think's all about somebody who don't believe in Jesus.  On the other hand,
lots of folks do love the first part of the Bible.  OK, what about this guy
named Queequeg?  He some kinda nigra?"
   "Actually, if you peruse with diligence you'll find he's a Pacific
Islander."
   "Oh, yeah.  Here it is.  From 'Kokovoko'.  Dang queer name.  Where in
the heck is it?"
   "Well, of course, it doesn't exist in reality.  I refer to it as an
'uncharted island.'  You see, my desire is to portray a whaling crew that
represents all the peoples of the world, and..."
   "I don't know, Herman.  We're getting a lot of flak these days over all
the kids in this country who don't know nothing about geography.  And here
you go makin' up places, and wanting taxpayers to help pay for it.
Couldn't we just say he's from Atlanta or Phoenix?"
   "Now, just a moment, my good man.  What do you mean, 'we'?"
   "Don't get touchy.  Let's just mark this item for further discussion."
   "...this is not OURS, but rather what I consider to be my masterp-..."
   "I SAID, Herman.  Let's move on.  Take a look at this part where Ishmael
and Queequeg go beddy-bye together in the Spouter Inn.  Now, is that really
necessary?"
   "It's symbolic.  It is a precursor of the common fate they will
encounter upon Capt. Ahab's whaling ship, and by extension the common fate
of all human beings on..."
   "But, Herman, they are SLEEPING together.  In the same BED.  Two
FELLERS!  Not only that, but one of 'em's a 'harpooner.'  Now I know you
artistes are real proud of your sly little images and all, but don't you
think that's a little obvious in its homersexual overtones?"
   "Just what, Mr. Dowd, would you alternatively suggest?"
   "They could just shoot a game of eight ball, like regular buddies.  They
could go bowling.  Pick up a coupla gals."
   "Good Lord."
   "We're a little troubled also by the whales.  Bad enough the animal
rights nutballs are gonna be all over us, but do these whales have to be
sperm whales?  That's awful 'reproductive' sounding.  Makes a lot of us
real uncomfortable.  Especially that scene where the crew's sittin' around
HANDLIN' the damn stuff, breaking up the lumps and whatnot.  You got your
blue whales, you got your gray whales, you got your killer whales -- why
not hunt those critters instead?  I mean, whales is whales, as far as the
average taxpayer is concerned."
   "I...I see."
   "Now, about the title."
   "I thought you;d sojourn 'round to that."
   "I got no problem with the 'Moby,' of course.  No one'll know what the
hell that means anyway.  But as for the other word... well.  Herman, you've
got to understand.  Innocent little children are going to see this book on
the shelves."
   "Perhaps then I ought to rename it to evoke the utmost benign
association in children.  Would the NEA find "Moby Breast" more to its
liking?"
   "Aw, HECK, no.  That's worse.  I was thinkin' more of a title that'd
reassure people from the git-go.  Something like, "Angling with Ahab."  Or,
how about this:  "You Can Call Me Ishmael, But That Don't Mean I'm a Jew."
That one's got a REAL nice artistic ring to it, don't you think?"

&gt; Rattlesnake:  The THIRD white meat.

Yup.  Years ago, the company I was with in that life had just set up
shop in its new facility on the edge of nowhere.  Well, actually, all
of southern Florida is pretty much nowhere, but this particular piece
of cutting-edge nowhere was on the western rim of Fort Lauderdale.  To
the west was nothing but scrub grass, a mound of construction fill into
which we had lots of fun shooting .41 Magnum rounds on our lunch hour,
and the levee.  On the other side of the levee was the Everglades,
alligators and all.

One sunny afternoon, somebody called the sheriff to report a snake
sunning itself on the front lawn.  (This was one sheriff before Bob
Butterworth, who made it his first order of business to sell all of
Broward County's radar equipment, saying his department had more
important things to do than pass out speeding tickets.)  Not content
with being just any old snake, this one was a six-foot Eastern
Diamondback.

The minions of the law arrived in due course; it being a truly balmy
afternoon, the snake was still there, enjoyng the bright Florida sun.
The new arrivals, lacking a sense of humor, weren't prepared to agree
that the present tenant was entitled to remain.  They solved the
dispute by the simple expedient of introducing the reptile to the
business end of a sawn-off 12-bore shotgun.  Needless to say, the snake
wasn't exactly charmed by the introduction.  It made the serene, if
sudden, journey to a better life. The assassin picked up the mutilated
corpse and was going to dispose of it, when we engineers broke in with,
"Er, ah, couldn't you just let us have it, please?"

The deceased was given over into our charge, and one of our number,
Mike Brown by name, took it into his care.  A few days later, Mike
arrived at work bearing a package of freshly smoked snake.  Best smoked
meat I ever ate, bar none.  Contrary to the opinion that goes around
among those who have never tasted rattlesnake, it didn't taste even a
little bit like chicken, smoked or otherwise.  None I've had since did,
either.

I wonder if Mike still has that snakeskin belt...?

Back when I was a Boy Scout in south Georgia, I used to be *so* proud that
although there were only four kinds of poisonous snakes in the United
States, we in south Georgia had all four kinds.  Now that I am camping in
New Hampshire, I am *so* glad that they don't have any poisonous snakes of
any kind.

I was standing around the office one day talking with a group and I said
something about having found some money lying on the ground.  Someone said
"I never look at the ground when I walk."  Two other people, one from
Alabama and one from India, said they always watched the ground.

Snake-smart is even rarer than street-smart in the cubbies of southern New
Hampshire.

    Chere Maitre!

    I return to the lists with this snappy little item from the "Noted
    with Pleasure" column in the New York Times Book Review:

    "(To munch on the memory of a deceased friend may be a pleasant way
    of evoking him or her. This is from "Funeral Cookbook" in "A
    Kipper with my Tea: Selected Food and Essays" by Alan Davidson
    (North Point).

    There is a custom which I have met only in Thailand, whereby a
    person composes a small cookbook before his or her death, so that
    it can be distributed as a keepsake to the mourners attending the
    funeral.

    The recipes, typically no more than a score, are likely to be
    those which the deceased especially enjoyed. They need not have
    been composed or used by the deceased, but often are. Sometimes
    they incorporate little anecdotes and attributions."

    The quote goes on for another 20 lines or so, essayizing and
    drawing ponderous conclusions, but my immediate reaction was NOT,
    as Dave Barry puts it, "What an amazing variety of belief systems
    the human community has developed to deal with the complexity of
    life on this planet!" No, my immediate reaction was, "Hmm. The
    carrot cookies, definitely, and the Russian potato salad of
    COURSE, and I couldn't possibly leave out November Pie, and I'd
    like to include the recipe for piccadillo that I got out of
    Woman's Day in 1978, and Elizabeth David's rice salad and pan bagna,
    and would I have room for the nonettes de poulet Agnes Sorel?"

    My only question is, once I've produced this feuilleton, am I then
    honor-bound to drop dead?

                      I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS TOO LONG

A couple of weeks ago I had to go down to the World Trade Center in Boston to
do a dry run of my DECworld workshop, "VAXcluster Fundamentals: Distributed
Computing at Its Best".  I didn't have to be there until late morning, so I
decided to get up a little late, go over the presentation while I ate
breakfast, and then head for Commonwealth pier.

Because my folks were visiting, I decided to have breakfast at the Sunnyside
Cafi in downtown Ashland near my house.  This way I could do some serious
reviewing of the material without having to appear rude to my folks.

When I arrived at the cafi, I was seated at one of the small tables in the
non-smoking section.  Seated in a booth diagonally across from me was a couple
who I would guess were in their early thirties.  He had on a tee shirt that
said something like, "A bad day fishing beats a good day at the office".  The
woman was one of those people who should not wear short shorts but insists upon
doing it anyway.  (Maybe we need a constitutional amendment about that.)

Brief snatches of the couple's conversation penetrated my prepping.   Their
dialog was peppered with such pithy phrases as,  "He don't got no..." and, "I
don't give a rat's ass if...".  One of them expressed a negative opinion about
the acquittal of "Helga Marcus and all her damn shoes".  I took a moment from
my studies (and my ham and cheese omelet) to value the differences and marvel
at the richness of our various social strata.

I was returning to my slides (and my omelet) when I heard, "...use DECpaint
for...".  I was impressed.  Our products have a wider scope than I thought.  I
was wondering if this could really be true.  Had our products really achieved
this much market penetration?  I tried to listen a little closer and my efforts
were rewarded with, "...but DECpaint can't...".

I abandoned my slides (but not my omelet) to concentrate on picking up more of
the conversation.  I wanted to determine just what application this unlikely
couple had for DECpaint.

I didn't have to wait long for an answer.  They decided that, "Three gallons of
deck paint should be enough to do the whole fuckin' porch".

Some friends of mine were sitting around in a diner in Lowell discussing
whether disk drives needed a software-accessible serial number on the disk in
addition to the metal plate with the serial number.  Someone walked over
from another table and very kindly offered to help them grind off and
replace the serial numbers from any cars they should care to steal.

Once, coming home from Tewksbury, my car crapped out and I was forced to
drive across a rush-hour intersection at 3 mph, accompanied by the outrage
of the cop directing traffic there.  I pulled into a service station on the
corner and solved the problem by jamming my lug wrench down the throat of my
carburetor (jammed butterfly) and then pulled the car over to the pumps to
fill it up.  The cop was off duty by then and wandered over.  "You're
putting gas in *that* thing?  Oh, well, I guess they burn better with a full
tank."

Subj:   New England pitfall for unwary visitors

Lobster eating is no simple accomplishment.  Not only do you
have to watch what you put into your mouth, you have to
watch what comes out.

As evidenced by the experience of two recent female guests
on two different occasions.  These ladies were of somewhat
dainty appetite and, like most modern day folks, ate the
good part first.  One hates to waste lobster, however, and
so one offers to the other diners who may have appetite
remaining:

Lady #1:  Does anyone want my body?

Lady #2:  If anyone wants my body, they can have it.

Needless to say, there were many takers on both occasions.
So beware.  Better to eat the body @i(first) so that the
worst one can be heard saying is "Does anyone want my
claws".  (As you can see, it is safer to eat the tail and
legs too, in that order, before offering to divest.)

Subj:   How CAMBRIDGE is it?

I wasn't going to inflict this on anyone, but the beginning of
Desperado #3033 (the woman speaking to her children) made me change my
mind:

We've been looking for some furniture for Tess's room.  Celeste called
a few stores yesterday, and after speaking to a woman at a store in
Cambridge, drove there to follow up what seemed to be a promising
lead.

After looking at some of the furniture, she couldn't find the pieces
in the price range that had been quoted on the phone.  She went up to
a saleswoman and said, When Celeste first said, "I called
...." (and no more than that), the woman's initial reply was, "What do
you want to do, flog me?"

So Celeste tried again, "I called earlier and asked about shelves, and
was told --"

The woman interrupted immediately.  "You didn't say you wanted it in
white!"  Celeste started to say something, but the woman interrupted
again: "You're projecting hostility -- I can feel it!!"  Celeste gave
her the most civil reply she could muster and walked out.  She wound
up buying the same thing she saw at the place in Cambridge at a store
somewhere else.

Subject: Re: Network Temperature Protocol
Newsgroups: comp.protocols.tcp-ip

In article &lt;9007210040.AA28109@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU&gt; you write:

&gt;As part of a distributed computing experiment, we are considering
&gt;setting up a Sun workstation, with a bi-metallic strip and small coil
&gt;temperature device, and providing a network wide reading, combined
&gt;with time of day service and cartesian location data.

Actually, the facilities for doing most of this are already available on
the internet.  If you run NTP (network TIME protocol) on a host, you can
certainly provide the time of day service.  To determine the temperature,
you need only look at the drift rate of the clock relative to the a
reference clock which corrolates rather nicely to the temperature of the
crystal in the clock of your computer.  You'll find that its trivial to
see day/night variations of the clock and hot vs. cold days.  All you need
do now is calibrate the drift rate to the temperature.

I'm sure Dave Mills can describe the use of NTP as an earthquake predictor
in another message.  This would be another important factor in picking
a location for a holiday.

Folks,

Louie refers to an incident where an NTP primary time server, perched almost
atop the Loma Pietra fault, mysteriously abandoned chime a couple of minutes
BEFORE the recent quake. We were tempted to investigate application of NTP
as earthquake predictor, until we learned that a fortuitous power failure
within BARRNET happened to quench its chime. Now, we are concentrating on
the nature of that precipitous failure as a possible earthwuake predictor.
Meanwhile, on the night of the quake, NTP turned out to be a useful monitoring
tool and provided much comfort that at least computers in the area, much less
people, were safe and that circuits out the Pacific were still operation.
Actually, what that was doing was confirming that the NASA Ames massive
single point of failure was still up. A UPS failure there later in the
evening conked out the entire Pacific.

Subj:   And you thought "he or she" was a nuisance

        This piece is (mostly) by my old friend Don Chesley, a hacker
with no access to the net at this time.  Don has a sense of humor that
is, um, well, *different*.  Once as a student at Columbia University,
he took advantage of the takeover of the office of the university
president to forge a letter on official university letterhead to his
parents, telling them that their son had been expelled, and, by the
way, would they like to contribute to the alumni fund?  He's also an
ex-physicist who has been known to worry about quaternions and the
like.  Somehow, thinking about algebraic tables of one sort or another
led him to this "research paper".  (I've edited it slightly for clarity,
but the original is not substantially longer.)

        "It is a well-known fact of botany that there are in general
three genders of flowers -- male, female, and perfect.  Each
individual plant may posess one or more types of flower; for example,
oak trees usually have male and female flowers on the same tree (such
an arrangement being called 'monoecious'), willow trees generally have
only male flowers or only female flowers ('dioecious'), cherry trees
have perfect flowers, and some maple trees have male and perfect
flowers on the same individual tree (one possible form of 'polygamy')
It is immediately apparent that there are 8 different combinations of
flowers possible (including having no flowers of any kind).  Thus
there are in essence 8 possible genders of trees (or other plants).
This obviously causes problems in referrring to or addressing trees
with pronouns.  This appalling situation has motivated the present
work, which one hopes will lead to better communications between
ourselves and our leafy fellow beings.

        "The pronouns to be proposed here will be composed by
stringing together basic units composed of a prefix indicating
person, and a suffix indicating gender..."

        Now, you might think that Don would make do with just the
normal English families of pronouns -- first, second, third persons,
etc., etc.  -- but no, not our Don...

        "In some cases, the plural will be indicated simply by
specifying each individual explicitly; in other cases, generic plural
indicators will have to be added.  Inclusivity and exclusivity in
first person plural pronouns will be denoted by infixes -- 'na' for
inclusive, 'va' for exclusive.  Examples given below will make these
general remarks clearer."

        "The simplest part of these new pronouns is the indicator of
person.  For first person, the prefix 'mi' will' will be used, with
'ti' for second person, and 'as', 'at' or 'ay' for third person,
depending on whether the individual referred to is 'here', 'there', or
'yonder' (i.e. out of sight), respectively.  The need for a
distinction between famililar and polite forms has not yet been
established, but courageous researchers are at this very moment
engaged in field surveys to answer this question."

        "The gender-bearing part of the pronoun must now be described.
A simple diagram will be of great aid in constructing the appropriate
syllable:

                m[ale]  f[emale] p[erfect]

present         b       o        g
absent          p       i        c

...Thus, a male ash tree has m present, f absent, and p absent, so the
gender syllable will be 'bic' ('b' for m present, 'i' for f absent,
and 'c' for p absent).  A male ash tree referring to himself (note
that in this case the ordinary 'he' can be used) would thus use the
pronoun 'mibic'.  An oak tree having both male and female flowers (but
no perfect ones) and which is out of sight of the speaker would be
referred to as 'ayboc' -- 'ay' for 'out of sight' and 'boc' meaning m
present, f present, and p absent.  A male ash referring to himself and
an oak he's addressing would thus use either 'mibictinaboc' as the
inclusive dual, or 'mibictivaboc' as the exclusive dual first person
pronoun."

        Unfortunately, the paper ends at this point, with no more
clarifying examples.  On the other hand, maybe it's just as well...

Hello people,

    This memo is about a tea pot.

    You might think from such a simple opening statement that what follows
is a parable with a deep and important meaning. Not so. Just the latest news
from the land of the Oranje.

    It all started, as they say, when we had purchased a hi-tech tea-pot
(well, a modified Thermos flask) and began to read the instructions (I did say
hi-tech). It quickly materialised that the person writing the instructions
was either one of four things :

a) A Principal Technical Writer , "pushing the edge of the envelope" by
   experimenting with the idea of using black humour in instructions to
   encourage the reader to read through them.

b) A Senior Technical writer, who feels hard done by for not being made
   a Principal Technical Writer, and is taking it out on the reader.

c) A misguided Technical Writer, who was told by the Senior Technical writer
   that the readership is mentally deficient with a maximum IQ of 50.

d) A not for long Associate Technical Writer, who thinks technical writing is
   when you use a stencil, and who's IQ is lucky to be 50.

Or, if you have any other suggestions, let me know.

The instructions start innocuously enough, by the description of how the vacuum
flask works. The first indication that something is wrong is when we are warned
    "Never eat directly from the container",
causing us to check again that we have bought a tea pot. Shortly after, we read
    "Having paid hard-earned money for this flask, you are certain to
     want to get the best out of it and use it daily. Your flask will
     serve you well if you READ these instructions CAREFULLY and follow
     them! After all, it is your money! And now, prepare to concentrate
     for 5 minutes - and switch those little grey brain cells into
     'memory store'".
Next a description of how to make tea and coffee and then
    "...the contents will keep warm for around 20 hours. - after all,
     little liquid = little heat = rapid cooling. (This is logical and
     has nothing to do with the quality of the flask)."
Still on the subject of heat,
    "Placing the flask on a hotplate ruins the flask and the coffee will
     not reheat anyway because if the heat cannot get out then none will
     get in.  However, if you have been tempted to try this out we will send
     you replacement parts - but this will cost YOU money."
Next, on to cleaning and,
    "Never submerse the flask or the stopper in water or put it in the
     dishwater. - After all, you wouldn't put your fridge in a bath full of
     water to clean it, would you ?"
And then, my favourite,
    "Please do not take the flask apart. There are many other more suitable
     objects to satisfy an inquisitive mind."
Still on the subject of potential damage,
    "If (the flask) happens to get damaged ...you will at best be left
     with a flask to adorn your cabinet. You need not expect it to keep
     anything warm again."
Then on the warranty,
    "You will have to foot the bill should a new glass lining be necessary.
     Or do you know of any companies that will replace broken plates free
     of charge ? The idea would not occur to you. Nor us!"
Finally, in summary,
    "It would not be such a bad idea to keep these instructions where you
     can find them again....Thank-you for taking the trouble to read
     through these instructions. We hope you enjoy using your vacuum
     flask."

Not as much as I enjoyed reading the instructions.

        Regards.

Heard this from a fellow Australian a while back, and thought I would pass
it on.

There are several things, that Australians living abroad miss, but notably,
for the purposes of this tale, they include Wines (specifically Old Ports),
Berocca by Roche (an effervescent Vitamin B tablet that does wonders for
hangovers), and  Panadeine a codeine based Headache Preparation, not
available in the U.S.
It seems that an Australian was due to visit the United States, and so
asked a few Expats that he would be visiting, if there was anything that he
could bring. As he went through customs on arrival in the U.S., he was
asked if he was carrying anything for anyone else. He opened his brief
case, and showed the agent, two bottles of port, 3 packets of 100 headache
tablets, and half a dozen rolls of Berocca.

To which the Customs agent commented, "You will need more booze than
that..."

(But then, he probably hasn't experienced good Australian Port.)

QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR
ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED DEFINE YOU AS

  I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing
ice.  I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch
breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention.
I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning
operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for
three days in a row.

  I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I
can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and
I can cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes.  I am an
expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.

  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once
single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basis from
a horde of ferocious army ants.  I play bluegrass cello, I was
scouted by the Mets.  I am the subject of numerous documentaries.
When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard.  I
enjoy urban hang gliding.  On Wednesdays, after school, I repair
electrical appliances free of charge.

 I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless
bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy
evening wear. I don't perspire.  I am a private citizen, yet I
receive fan mail.  I have been caller number nine and have won
the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a
traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400.  My deft
floral arrangements have earned me fame in international circles.
Children trust me.

  I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly
accuracy.  I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David
Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire
dining room that evening.  I know the exact location of every
food item in the supermarket.  I have performed covert operations
for the CIA.  I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a
chair.  While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated
with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery.  The
laws of physics do not apply to me.

  I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all
paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact
origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of lifebut forgot to
write it down.  I have made extraordinary four-course meals using
only a Mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize-winning clams.  I
have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri
Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.  I have played Hamlet, I
have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.

  But I have not yet gone to college.

Organization: Rutgers University, Newark, NJ

&gt;If you are writing programs
&gt;for commercial sale you shouldn't be using BASIC.  If not you still shouldn't
&gt;be using BASIC for anything but quick and dirty stuff.  If you feel you must
&gt;use BASIC then you shouldn't be protecting them but rather let others see the
&gt;actual code.
&gt;D'Arcy J.M. Cain (darcy@druid)     |

I continue to make several thousand dollars a year on shareware programs
that I have written in BASIC, and I laugh at this kind of elitism all the
way to the bank.  I am an English professor and I use spaghetti code to
write  programs more complicated and more useful than those of most
computer science  graduates who pontificate these linguistic prejudices.

I once won "Best Article of the Year" from the Hong Kong Computer Society
(the  professional group of people who run the computers in the world's
third largest banking center and at one of the world's most complex
airports) in recognition  for an article that I wrote about programming in
a language simpler yet than  even BASIC, namely in WordStar 3.3's
MailMerge, which I enslaved to teach me  Cantonese.

Good programs derive from imagination far more than from mindless mastery
of codes.  My style-checker is extremely popular with professional
journalists not because I can get the lightning speed of some of the
competition, but because my program monitors what good writers really  care
enough about monitoring.  My program that manages writers' circulation of
manuscripts is used by several hundred writers, at least two of them among
the most published poets of our time.  I have even turned over the code to
a computer science class or two just so they could laugh at it, and still
eat humble pie, cause honey, they would have to have as many hundreds of
publications as I have (MUSES tells me today that it is at 764) before they
would begin to imagine all the bells and whistles that writers welcome in a
good program.

Of course I would like to have a version of my program in assembler or some
other more powerful code, but for now I settle for the ever newer and
faster chips that keep it trucking and keep those who use my program from
the drudgery that used to plague their circulation and bookkeeping.

I'm also delighted when I snoop at many other *.EXE programs and discover
that others with programs that do good things have used BASIC source code.

Yes, if I were starting afresh, I would use C or Pascal, but I am not
starting afresh, and I dare some "experts" to catch up.

I had the same problem in learning Cantonese.  When I had a vocabulary of
10 words I was into the streets talking to real people and learning
rapidly and naturally.  Some of my colleagues who were afraid to say Neehow
(hello) until no one had laughed at them, studied the language for three
years before they gave up and still sit in their gweilo (white ghost)
apartments talking English only.

The ideal would be to have programmers and users collaborate, but I find
most programmers much too arrogant to consider that, and most users  too
illiterate about binary approaches to be able to identify what  can
actually be put into on/off logic.

At Chinese University several of my colleagues in computer science used to
send their senior students to play by me ideas for their senior  projects.
Of course I  advocated  innovative projects in the humanities, but  I could
well see why most opted for yet on more office management program, or  a
new file management program:  they were safer and not subject to the
caprice  of "humanists" so ill educated as to tell a machine, merely: "Tell
me whether  that sentence is right or wrong."

        Richard P. Feynman was a member of the Rodger's commission that
investigated the Challenger disaster.  The commission would not include some of
his thoughts and so he issued a "minority of one" report.  I take his minority
of one more seriously than any commission.  He is no longer alive - how sad.

        Personal observations on the reliability of  the  Shuttle
        by R.  P.  Feynman

        Introduction
        ------------

             It appears that there are  enormous  differences  of
        opinion  as  to the probability of a failure with loss of
        vehicle and of human  life.   The  estimates  range  from
        roughly  1  in  100  to 1 in 100,000.  The higher figures
        come from the working engineers, and the very low figures
        from management.  What are the causes and consequences of
        this lack of agreement?  Since 1 part  in  100,000  would
        imply  that  one  could put a Shuttle up each day for 300
        years expecting to lose only one, we could  properly  ask
        "What is the cause of management's fantastic faith in the
        machinery?"

             We have also found that certification criteria  used
        in  Flight  Readiness  Reviews  often develop a gradually
        decreasing strictness.  The argument that the  same  risk
        was  flown before without failure is often accepted as an
        argument for the safety of accepting it  again.   Because
        of this, obvious weaknesses are accepted again and again,
        sometimes  without  a  sufficiently  serious  attempt  to
        remedy  them,  or  to  delay  a  flight  because of their
        continued presence.

             There are several sources of information.  There are
        published criteria for certification, including a history
        of modifications in the form of waivers  and  deviations.
        In  addition, the records of the Flight Readiness Reviews
        for each flight document the arguments used to accept the
        risks  of  the flight.  Information was obtained from the
        direct testimony and the  reports  of  the  range  safety
        officer, Louis J.  Ullian, with respect to the history of
        success of solid fuel rockets.  There was a further study
        by  him  (as  chairman  of  the launch abort safety panel
        (LASP)) in an attempt to determine the risks involved  in
        possible  accidents  leading to radioactive contamination
        from attempting to fly a plutonium power supply (RTG) for
        future  planetary  missions.   The NASA study of the same
        question is also available.  For the History of the Space
        Shuttle  Main  Engines,  interviews  with  management and
        engineers  at  Marshall,  and  informal  interviews  with
        engineers  at Rocketdyne, were made.  An independent (Cal
        Tech) mechanical engineer who consulted  for  NASA  about
        engines  was  also  interviewed  informally.   A visit to
        Johnson was made to gather information on the reliability
        of  the  avionics  (computers,  sensors,  and effectors).
        Finally there is a  report  "A  Review  of  Certification
        Practices,  Potentially  Applicable to Man-rated Reusable
        Rocket  Engines,"  prepared   at   the   Jet   Propulsion
        Laboratory  by  N.  Moore, et al., in February, 1986, for
        NASA Headquarters, Office of Space Flight.  It deals with
        the  methods  used by the FAA and the military to certify
        their gas turbine and rocket engines.  These authors were
        also interviewed informally.

        Solid Rockets (SRB)
        -------------------

             An estimate of the reliability of solid rockets  was
        made  by  the  range  safety  officer,  by  studying  the
        experience of all previous  rocket  flights.   Out  of  a
        total  of  nearly  2,900  flights,  121 failed (1 in 25).
        This includes, however, what may be called, early errors,
        rockets  flown  for  the  first few times in which design
        errors are  discovered  and  fixed.   A  more  reasonable
        figure  for  the  mature  rockets might be 1 in 50.  With
        special care in the selection of parts and in inspection,
        a  figure  of  below  1 in 100 might be achieved but 1 in
        1,000 is probably not attainable with today's technology.
        (Since there are two rockets on the Shuttle, these rocket
        failure rates must be  doubled  to  get  Shuttle  failure
        rates from Solid Rocket Booster failure.)

             NASA officials argue that the figure is much  lower.
        They  point  out  that  these  figures  are  for unmanned
        rockets but since the Shuttle is a  manned  vehicle  "the
        probability  of mission success is necessarily very close
        to 1.0." It is not very clear  what  this  phrase  means.
        Does  it  mean  it  is  close to 1 or that it ought to be
        close to 1?  They go on  to  explain  "Historically  this
        extremely  high  degree of mission success has given rise
        to a difference in philosophy between manned space flight
        programs   and   unmanned   programs;   i.e.,   numerical
        probability usage versus  engineering  judgment."  (These
        quotations  are  from  "Space  Shuttle Data for Planetary
        Mission RTG Safety Analysis," Pages  3-1,  3-1,  February
        15,  1985, NASA, JSC.) It is true that if the probability
        of failure was as low as 1 in 100,000 it  would  take  an
        inordinate  number  of  tests to determine it ( you would
        get nothing but a string of perfect flights from which no
        precise figure, other than that the probability is likely
        less than the number of such flights  in  the  string  so
        far).   But,  if  the  real  probability is not so small,
        flights would show troubles, near failures, and  possible
        actual  failures with a reasonable number of trials.  and
        standard statistical  methods  could  give  a  reasonable
        estimate.   In  fact, previous NASA experience had shown,
        on occasion, just such difficulties, near accidents,  and
        accidents,  all  giving  warning  that the probability of
        flight failure was not so very small.  The  inconsistency
        of  the  argument  not  to  determine reliability through
        historical experience, as the range safety  officer  did,
        is   that   NASA   also  appeals  to  history,  beginning
        "Historically this high  degree  of  mission  success..."

        Finally,   if   we  are  to  replace  standard  numerical
        probability usage with engineering judgment,  why  do  we
        find  such  an  enormous disparity between the management
        estimate and the judgment of  the  engineers?   It  would
        appear  that, for whatever purpose, be it for internal or
        external consumption, the management of NASA  exaggerates
        the reliability of its product, to the point of fantasy.

             The  history  of  the   certification   and   Flight
        Readiness  Reviews will not be repeated here.  (See other
        part of Commission reports.) The phenomenon of  accepting
        for  flight,  seals that had shown erosion and blow-by in
        previous flights, is very clear.  The  Challenger  flight
        is an excellent example.  There are several references to
        flights that had gone before.  The acceptance and success
        of  these  flights  is  taken as evidence of safety.  But
        erosion and blow-by are not  what  the  design  expected.
        They are warnings that something is wrong.  The equipment
        is not operating as expected, and therefore  there  is  a
        danger  that it can operate with even wider deviations in
        this unexpected and not thoroughly understood  way.   The
        fact  that  this  danger  did  not  lead to a catastrophe
        before is no guarantee that it will not  the  next  time,
        unless it is completely understood.  When playing Russian
        roulette the fact that the first shot got off  safely  is
        little comfort for the next.  The origin and consequences
        of the erosion and blow-by were not understood.  They did
        not   occur  equally  on  all  flights  and  all  joints;
        sometimes more, and sometimes less.   Why  not  sometime,
        when  whatever conditions determined it were right, still
        more leading to catastrophe?

             In spite of these  variations  from  case  to  case,
        officials  behaved  as  if  they  understood  it,  giving
        apparently  logical  arguments  to   each   other   often
        depending  on  the  "success"  of  previous flights.  For
        example.  in determining if flight 51-L was safe  to  fly
        in  the face of ring erosion in flight 51-C, it was noted
        that the erosion depth was only one-third of the  radius.
        It  had been noted in an experiment cutting the ring that
        cutting it as deep as one radius was necessary before the
        ring  failed.   Instead  of  being  very  concerned  that
        variations  of   poorly   understood   conditions   might
        reasonably  create  a  deeper  erosion  this time, it was
        asserted, there was "a safety factor of three." This is a
        strange use of the engineer's term ,"safety factor." If a
        bridge is built to withstand a certain load  without  the
        beams  permanently  deforming,  cracking, or breaking, it
        may be designed for the materials used to actually  stand
        up  under  three times the load.  This "safety factor" is
        to allow for uncertain excesses of load, or unknown extra
        loads,  or  weaknesses  in  the  material that might have
        unexpected flaws, etc.  If now the expected load comes on
        to  the new bridge and a crack appears in a beam, this is
        a failure of the design.  There was no safety  factor  at
        all;  even  though  the  bridge did not actually collapse
        because the crack went only one-third of the way  through
        the  beam.  The O-rings of the Solid Rocket Boosters were
        not designed to erode.  Erosion was a clue that something
        was  wrong.   Erosion was not something from which safety
        can be inferred.

             There was no way, without full  understanding,  that
        one  could  have confidence that conditions the next time
        might not produce erosion three times  more  severe  than
        the   time   before.    Nevertheless,   officials  fooled
        themselves into thinking they had such understanding  and
        confidence, in spite of the peculiar variations from case
        to case.  A mathematical  model  was  made  to  calculate
        erosion.    This  was  a  model  based  not  on  physical
        understanding but on empirical curve fitting.  To be more
        detailed, it was supposed a stream of hot gas impinged on
        the O-ring material, and the heat was determined  at  the
        point  of  stagnation  (so far, with reasonable physical,
        thermodynamic laws).  But to determine  how  much  rubber
        eroded  it was assumed this depended only on this heat by
        a formula suggested by data on  a  similar  material.   A
        logarithmic  plot  suggested  a  straight line, so it was
        supposed that the erosion varied as the .58 power of  the
        heat,  the .58 being determined by a nearest fit.  At any
        rate, adjusting some other  numbers,  it  was  determined
        that  the  model  agreed  with  the  erosion (to depth of
        one-third the radius of the ring).  There is nothing much
        so   wrong   with   this   as   believing   the   answer!
        Uncertainties appear  everywhere.   How  strong  the  gas
        stream  might  be was unpredictable, it depended on holes
        formed in the putty.  Blow-by showed that the ring  might
        fail  even  though not, or only partially eroded through.
        The empirical formula was known to be uncertain,  for  it
        did not go directly through the very data points by which
        it was determined.  There were a  cloud  of  points  some
        twice  above,  and  some twice below the fitted curve, so
        erosions twice predicted were reasonable from that  cause
        alone.    Similar   uncertainties  surrounded  the  other
        constants in  the  formula,  etc.,  etc.   When  using  a
        mathematical  model  careful  attention  must be given to
        uncertainties in the model.

        Liquid Fuel Engine (SSME)
        -------------------------

             During the flight of 51-L the  three  Space  Shuttle
        Main  Engines  all  worked  perfectly,  even, at the last
        moment, beginning to shut down the engines  as  the  fuel
        supply  began  to fail.  The question arises, however, as
        to whether, had it failed, and we were to investigate  it
        in  as much detail as we did the Solid Rocket Booster, we
        would find a similar lack of attention to  faults  and  a
        deteriorating  reliability.   In  other  words,  were the
        organization weaknesses that contributed to the  accident
        confined  to the Solid Rocket Booster sector or were they
        a more general characteristic of NASA?  To that  end  the
        Space  Shuttle  Main  Engines  and the avionics were both
        investigated.  No similar study of the  Orbiter,  or  the
        External Tank were made.

             The engine is a much more complicated structure than
        the  Solid Rocket Booster, and a great deal more detailed
        engineering goes into  it.   Generally,  the  engineering
        seems  to  be of high quality and apparently considerable
        attention is paid to deficiencies  and  faults  found  in
        operation.

             The usual way that such engines  are  designed  (for
        military   or   civilian  aircraft)  may  be  called  the
        component system,  or  bottom-up  design.   First  it  is
        necessary  to  thoroughly  understand  the properties and
        limitations of the materials  to  be  used  (for  turbine
        blades, for example), and tests are begun in experimental
        rigs to determine  those.   With  this  knowledge  larger
        component  parts  (such  as  bearings)  are  designed and
        tested individually.  As deficiencies and  design  errors
        are  noted  they  are corrected and verified with further
        testing.  Since one tests only  parts  at  a  time  these
        tests   and   modifications  are  not  overly  expensive.
        Finally one works up to the final design  of  the  entire
        engine, to the necessary specifications.  There is a good
        chance, by this  time  that  the  engine  will  generally
        succeed,  or  that  any  failures are easily isolated and
        analyzed  because  the  failure  modes,  limitations   of
        materials, etc., are so well understood.  There is a very
        good chance that the modifications to the engine  to  get
        around  the final difficulties are not very hard to make,
        for most  of  the  serious  problems  have  already  been
        discovered and dealt with in the earlier, less expensive,
        stages of the process.

             The Space Shuttle  Main  Engine  was  handled  in  a
        different manner, top down, we might say.  The engine was
        designed and put together all  at  once  with  relatively
        little  detailed  preliminary  study  of the material and
        components.   Then  when  troubles  are  found   in   the
        bearings, turbine blades, coolant pipes, etc., it is more
        expensive and difficult to discover the causes  and  make
        changes.   For  example,  cracks  have  been found in the
        turbine blades of the  high  pressure  oxygen  turbopump.
        Are  they  caused by flaws in the material, the effect of
        the oxygen atmosphere on the properties of the  material,
        the   thermal   stresses  of  startup  or  shutdown,  the
        vibration and stresses of steady running,  or  mainly  at
        some  resonance at certain speeds, etc.?  How long can we
        run from crack initiation to crack failure, and how  does
        this  depend  on power level?  Using the completed engine
        as a test bed to  resolve  such  questions  is  extremely
        expensive.  One does not wish to lose an entire engine in
        order to find out where and how failure occurs.  Yet,  an
        accurate  knowledge  of  this information is essential to
        acquire a confidence in the engine  reliability  in  use.
        Without  detailed  understanding,  confidence  can not be
        attained.

             A further disadvantage of  the  top-down  method  is
        that,  if  an  understanding  of  a  fault is obtained, a
        simple fix, such as a new shape for the turbine  housing,
        may  be impossible to implement without a redesign of the
        entire engine.

             The Space Shuttle Main Engine is a  very  remarkable
        machine.  It has a greater ratio of thrust to weight than
        any previous engine.  It is built  at  the  edge  of,  or
        outside  of, previous engineering experience.  Therefore,
        as  expected,  many  different   kinds   of   flaws   and
        difficulties  have turned up.  Because, unfortunately, it
        was built in the top-down manner, they are  difficult  to
        find  and  fix.   The  design  aim  of  a  lifetime of 55
        missions equivalent firings (27,000 seconds of operation,
        either  in  a mission of 500 seconds, or on a test stand)
        has not been obtained.   The  engine  now  requires  very
        frequent  maintenance and replacement of important parts,
        such as turbopumps, bearings, sheet metal housings,  etc.
        The high-pressure fuel turbopump had to be replaced every
        three or four mission equivalents (although that may have
        been  fixed,  now) and the high pressure oxygen turbopump
        every five or six.  This is at most ten  percent  of  the
        original specification.  But our main concern here is the
        determination of reliability.

             In a total of about 250,000  seconds  of  operation,
        the  engines  have  failed  seriously  perhaps  16 times.
        Engineering pays close attention to  these  failings  and
        tries  to  remedy  them  as quickly as possible.  This it
        does by  test  studies  on  special  rigs  experimentally
        designed for the flaws in question, by careful inspection
        of the engine for suggestive clues (like cracks), and  by
        considerable  study  and analysis.  In this way, in spite
        of the difficulties  of  top-down  design,  through  hard
        work, many of the problems have apparently been solved.

             A list of  some  of  the  problems  follows.   Those
        followed by an asterisk (*) are probably solved:

        1.  Turbine blade cracks in high pressure fuel turbopumps
            (HPFTP).  (May have been solved.)

        2.  Turbine  blade  cracks  in   high   pressure   oxygen
            turbopumps (HPOTP).

        3.  Augmented Spark Igniter (ASI) line rupture.*

        4.  Purge check valve failure.*

        5.  ASI chamber erosion.*

        6.  HPFTP turbine sheet metal cracking.

        7.  HPFTP coolant liner failure.*

        8.  Main combustion chamber outlet elbow failure.*

        9.  Main combustion chamber inlet elbow weld offset.*

       10.  HPOTP subsynchronous whirl.*

       11.  Flight acceleration  safety  cutoff  system  (partial
            failure in a redundant system).*

       12.  Bearing spalling (partially solved).

       13.  A  vibration  at  4,000  Hertz  making  some  engines
            inoperable, etc.

             Many  of  these  solved  problems  are   the   early
        difficulties  of a new design, for 13 of them occurred in
        the first 125,000 seconds and only three  in  the  second
        125,000  seconds.   Naturally, one can never be sure that
        all the bugs are out, and, for some, the fix may not have
        addressed  the  true cause.  Thus, it is not unreasonable
        to guess there may be at least one surprise in  the  next
        250,000  seconds,  a  probability of 1/500 per engine per
        mission.  On a mission there are three engines, but  some
        accidents  would  possibly  be contained, and only affect
        one engine.  The system can abort with only two  engines.
        Therefore  let  us  say that the unknown suprises do not,
        even  of  themselves,  permit  us  to  guess   that   the
        probability  of  mission  failure do to the Space Shuttle
        Main Engine is less than 1/500.  To this we must add  the
        chance  of  failure  from  known,  but  as  yet unsolved,
        problems (those without the asterisk in the list  above).
        These  we  discuss  below.  (Engineers at Rocketdyne, the
        manufacturer, estimate the total probability as 1/10,000.
        Engineers  at  marshal  estimate  it as 1/300, while NASA
        management, to whom these engineers report, claims it  is
        1/100,000.   An  independent engineer consulting for NASA
        thought 1 or 2 per 100 a reasonable estimate.)

             The history  of  the  certification  principles  for
        these  engines  is  confusing  and  difficult to explain.
        Initially the rule seems to have  been  that  two  sample
        engines  must  each  have  had  twice  the time operating
        without failure as the operating time of the engine to be
        certified  (rule  of  2x).   At  least  that  is  the FAA
        practice, and NASA seems to have adopted  it,  originally
        expecting  the certified time to be 10 missions (hence 20
        missions for each sample).  Obviously the best engines to
        use  for  comparison  would  be  those  of greatest total
        (flight plus test) operating time -- the so-called "fleet
        leaders."  But  what if a third sample and several others
        fail in a short time?  Surely we will not be safe because
        two were unusual in lasting longer.  The short time might
        be more representative of the real possibilities, and  in
        the  spirit  of  the  safety  factor of 2, we should only
        operate at half the time of the short-lived samples.

             The slow shift toward decreasing safety  factor  can
        be  seen  in  many  examples.   We take that of the HPFTP
        turbine blades.  First of all  the  idea  of  testing  an
        entire  engine was abandoned.  Each engine number has had
        many important parts  (like  the  turbopumps  themselves)
        replaced  at frequent intervals, so that the rule must be
        shifted from engines to components.  We accept  an  HPFTP
        for  a  certification  time  if two samples have each run
        successfully for twice that time (and  of  course,  as  a
        practical  matter,  no longer insisting that this time be
        as large as 10 missions).  But  what  is  "successfully?"
        The  FAA calls a turbine blade crack a failure, in order,
        in practice, to really provide a  safety  factor  greater
        than  2.   There  is  some  time  that  an engine can run
        between the time a crack originally starts until the time
        it  has  grown  large  enough  to  fracture.  (The FAA is
        contemplating new rules that take this extra safety  time
        into  account,  but only if it is very carefully analyzed
        through known models within a known range  of  experience
        and  with  materials  thoroughly  tested.   None of these
        conditions apply to the Space Shuttle Main Engine.

             Cracks were found in many second stage HPFTP turbine
        blades.   In  one  case  three  were  found  after  1,900
        seconds, while in another they were not found after 4,200
        seconds,   although  usually  these  longer  runs  showed
        cracks.  To follow this story further we  shall  have  to
        realize that the stress depends a great deal on the power
        level.  The Challenger flight was to be at, and  previous
        flights  had  been at, a power level called 104% of rated
        power level during most of  the  time  the  engines  were
        operating.    Judging  from  some  material  data  it  is
        supposed that at the level 104% of rated power level, the
        time  to  crack is about twice that at 109% or full power
        level (FPL).  Future flights were to  be  at  this  level
        because  of heavier payloads, and many tests were made at
        this level.  Therefore dividing time at  104%  by  2,  we
        obtain  units  called equivalent full power level (EFPL).
        (Obviously, some uncertainty is introduced by  that,  but
        it  has  not been studied.) The earliest cracks mentioned
        above occurred at 1,375 EFPL.

             Now the certification rule becomes "limit all second
        stage  blades to a maximum of 1,375 seconds EFPL." If one
        objects that the safety factor of 2 is lost it is pointed
        out  that  the  one  turbine  ran  for 3,800 seconds EFPL
        without cracks, and half of this is 1,900 so we are being
        more  conservative.   We  have  fooled ourselves in three
        ways.  First we have only one sample, and it is  not  the
        fleet  leader, for the other two samples of 3,800 or more
        seconds had 17 cracked blades between them.   (There  are
        59  blades  in the engine.) Next we have abandoned the 2x
        rule and substituted equal time.  And finally,  1,375  is
        where  we  did see a crack.  We can say that no crack had
        been found below 1,375, but the last time we  looked  and
        saw  no  cracks  was  1,100 seconds EFPL.  We do not know
        when the crack formed between these  times,  for  example
        cracks   may   have   formed   at   1,150  seconds  EFPL.
        (Approximately 2/3 of the blade sets tested in excess  of
        1,375  seconds  EFPL had cracks.  Some recent experiments
        have, indeed, shown cracks as early as 1,150 seconds.) It
        was important to keep the number high, for the Challenger
        was to fly an engine very close to the limit by the  time
        the flight was over.

             Finally it is claimed  that  the  criteria  are  not
        abandoned,  and  the system is safe, by giving up the FAA
        convention  that  there  should   be   no   cracks,   and
        considering  only a completely fractured blade a failure.
        With this definition no engine has yet failed.  The  idea
        is  that  since  there  is sufficient time for a crack to
        grow to a fracture we can insure  that  all  is  safe  by
        inspecting  all  blades  for  cracks.  If they are found,
        replace them, and if none are found we have  enough  time
        for  a  safe mission.  This makes the crack problem not a
        flight safety problem, but merely a maintenance problem.

             This may in fact be true.  But how well do  we  know
        that  cracks  always  grow slowly enough that no fracture
        can occur in a mission?  Three engines have run for  long
        times  with  a  few  cracked  blades (about 3,000 seconds
        EFPL) with no blades broken off.

             But a fix for this cracking may have been found.  By
        changing  the  blade shape, shot-peening the surface, and
        covering with insulation to exclude  thermal  shock,  the
        blades have not cracked so far.

             A very similar  story  appears  in  the  history  of
        certification  of  the  HPOTP,  but we shall not give the
        details here.

             It is evident, in summary, that the Flight Readiness
        Reviews  and certification rules show a deterioration for
        some of the problems of the  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine
        that  is  closely  analogous to the deterioration seen in
        the rules for the Solid Rocket Booster.

        Avionics
        --------

             By "avionics" is meant the computer  system  on  the
        Orbiter   as   well  as  its  input  sensors  and  output
        actuators.  At first we will restrict  ourselves  to  the
        computers   proper   and   not   be  concerned  with  the
        reliability of the input information from the sensors  of
        temperature,   pressure,   etc.,  nor  with  whether  the
        computer output is faithfully followed by  the  actuators
        of  rocket  firings,  mechanical  controls,  displays  to
        astronauts, etc.

             The computer system is very elaborate,  having  over
        250,000  lines  of  code.   It is responsible, among many
        other things, for the automatic  control  of  the  entire
        ascent  to orbit, and for the descent until well into the
        atmosphere (below Mach  1)  once  one  button  is  pushed
        deciding  the landing site desired.  It would be possible
        to make the entire landing automatically (except that the
        landing  gear  lowering  signal  is expressly left out of
        computer control, and must  be  provided  by  the  pilot,
        ostensibly  for  safety  reasons)  but  such  an entirely
        automatic landing is probably not  as  safe  as  a  pilot
        controlled  landing.  During orbital flight it is used in
        the control of payloads, in displaying information to the
        astronauts,  and  the  exchange  of  information  to  the
        ground.  It is evident that the safety of flight requires
        guaranteed  accuracy of this elaborate system of computer
        hardware and software.

             In brief, the hardware  reliability  is  ensured  by
        having  four  essentially  independent identical computer
        systems.  Where possible each sensor  also  has  multiple
        copies, usually four, and each copy feeds all four of the
        computer lines.  If the inputs from the sensors disagree,
        depending   on  circumstances,  certain  averages,  or  a
        majority selection is used as the effective  input.   The
        algorithm  used  by each of the four computers is exactly
        the same, so their inputs (since each sees all copies  of
        the  sensors)  are  the same.  Therefore at each step the
        results in each computer should be identical.  From  time
        to time they are compared, but because they might operate
        at slightly different speeds a  system  of  stopping  and
        waiting  at  specific  times  is  instituted  before each
        comparison is made.  If one of the  computers  disagrees,
        or  is  too  late  in  having its answer ready, the three
        which do agree are assumed to be correct and  the  errant
        computer is taken completely out of the system.  If, now,
        another computer fails, as judged by the agreement of the
        other two, it is taken out of the system, and the rest of
        the flight canceled, and descent to the landing  site  is
        instituted,  controlled  by  the two remaining computers.
        It is seen that this is  a  redundant  system  since  the
        failure of only one computer does not affect the mission.

        Finally, as an extra feature of safety, there is a  fifth
        independent  computer,  whose  memory is loaded with only
        the programs of ascent and descent, and which is  capable
        of  controlling the descent if there is a failure of more
        than two of the computers of the main line four.

             There is not enough room in the memory of  the  main
        line  computers  for all the programs of ascent, descent,
        and payload programs in flight, so the memory  is  loaded
        about four time from tapes, by the astronauts.

             Because of the enormous effort required  to  replace
        the  software  for  such  an  elaborate  system,  and for
        checking a new system out, no change has been made to the
        hardware  since the system began about fifteen years ago.
        The  actual  hardware  is  obsolete;  for  example,   the
        memories  are  of  the  old  ferrite  core  type.   It is
        becoming more difficult to find manufacturers  to  supply
        such   old-fashioned   computers  reliably  and  of  high
        quality.  Modern computers are very much  more  reliable,
        can  run  much faster, simplifying circuits, and allowing
        more to be done, and would not require so much loading of
        memory, for the memories are much larger.

             The  software  is  checked  very  carefully   in   a
        bottom-up  fashion.   First,  each  new  line  of code is
        checked, then sections of code or  modules  with  special
        functions  are  verified.  The scope is increased step by
        step until  the  new  changes  are  incorporated  into  a
        complete  system  and  checked.   This complete output is
        considered  the  final  product,  newly  released.    But
        completely   independently   there   is   an  independent
        verification group, that takes an adversary  attitude  to
        the  software  development  group, and tests and verifies
        the software as if it were a customer  of  the  delivered
        product.   There  is additional verification in using the
        new programs in simulators, etc.  A discovery of an error
        during  verification  testing is considered very serious,
        and its origin  studied  very  carefully  to  avoid  such
        mistakes in the future.  Such unexpected errors have been
        found only about six times in  all  the  programming  and
        program  changing  (for new or altered payloads) that has
        been done.  The principle that is followed  is  that  all
        the  verification  is not an aspect of program safety, it
        is merely a test of that safety,  in  a  non-catastrophic
        verification.   Flight  safety  is to be judged solely on
        how well the programs do in the  verification  tests.   A
        failure here generates considerable concern.

             To summarize then, the  computer  software  checking
        system  and  attitude  is  of the highest quality.  There
        appears to be no process  of  gradually  fooling  oneself
        while  degrading standards so characteristic of the Solid
        Rocket  Booster  or  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine  safety
        systems.   To be sure, there have been recent suggestions
        by management to curtail  such  elaborate  and  expensive
        tests  as  being unnecessary at this late date in Shuttle
        history.   This  must  be  resisted  for  it   does   not
        appreciate  the  mutual subtle influences, and sources of
        error generated by even small changes of one  part  of  a
        program  on  another.   There  are perpetual requests for
        changes as new payloads and new demands and modifications
        are  suggested  by  the  users.   Changes  are  expensive
        because they require extensive testing.  The  proper  way
        to  save  money  is  to  curtail  the number of requested
        changes, not the quality of testing for each.

             One might add that the  elaborate  system  could  be
        very   much   improved   by   more  modern  hardware  and
        programming techniques.  Any  outside  competition  would
        have  all  the  advantages  of starting over, and whether
        that is a good idea for  NASA  now  should  be  carefully
        considered.

             Finally, returning to the sensors and  actuators  of
        the  avionics system, we find that the attitude to system
        failure and reliability is not nearly as good as for  the
        computer  system.   For  example,  a difficulty was found
        with certain temperature sensors sometimes failing.   Yet
        18  months  later the same sensors were still being used,
        still  sometimes  failing,  until  a  launch  had  to  be
        scrubbed  because  two  of  them failed at the same time.
        Even on a succeeding flight this  unreliable  sensor  was
        used  again.   Again reaction control systems, the rocket
        jets used for reorienting and control in flight still are
        somewhat  unreliable.   There is considerable redundancy,
        but a long history of failures, none  of  which  has  yet
        been  extensive  enough  to seriously affect flight.  The
        action of the jets is checked by sensors,  and,  if  they
        fail  to  fire  the computers choose another jet to fire.
        But they are not designed to fail, and the problem should
        be solved.

        Conclusions
        -----------

             If a reasonable launch schedule is to be maintained,
        engineering  often  cannot be done fast enough to keep up
        with  the   expectations   of   originally   conservative
        certification  criteria designed to guarantee a very safe
        vehicle.  In these situations,  subtly,  and  often  with
        apparently logical arguments, the criteria are altered so
        that flights  may  still  be  certified  in  time.   They
        therefore  fly  in  a relatively unsafe condition, with a
        chance of failure of  the  order  of  a  percent  (it  is
        difficult to be more accurate).

             Official management, on the other  hand,  claims  to
        believe  the  probability  of failure is a thousand times
        less.  One reason for this may be an  attempt  to  assure
        the government of NASA perfection and success in order to
        ensure the supply of funds.  The other may be  that  they
        sincerely believed it to be true, demonstrating an almost
        incredible lack of communication between  themselves  and
        their working engineers.

             In  any  event  this  has   had   very   unfortunate
        consequences,  the  most serious of which is to encourage
        ordinary citizens to fly in such a dangerous machine,  as
        if  it  had  attained the safety of an ordinary airliner.
        The astronauts,  like  test  pilots,  should  know  their
        risks,  and  we  honor  them  for their courage.  Who can
        doubt that  McAuliffe  was  equally  a  person  of  great
        courage,  who was closer to an awareness of the true risk
        than NASA management would have us believe?

             Let us make  recommendations  to  ensure  that  NASA
        officials  deal  in  a  world of reality in understanding
        technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to
        be  actively trying to eliminate them.  They must live in
        reality in comparing the costs and utility of the Shuttle
        to  other  methods  of  entering space.  And they must be
        realistic in making contracts, in estimating  costs,  and
        the  difficulty  of  the projects.  Only realistic flight
        schedules should  be  proposed,  schedules  that  have  a
        reasonable  chance  of  being  met.   If  in this way the
        government would not support them, then so be  it.   NASA
        owes  it  to the citizens from whom it asks support to be
        frank, honest, and informative, so  that  these  citizens
        can  make  the  wisest  decisions  for  the  use of their
        limited resources.

             For  a  successful  technology,  reality  must  take
        precedence  over  public  relations, for nature cannot be
        fooled.

        So, there wasn't anything I felt like cutting from it, so I left it
        full length.  I don't know that drummer-lockpicker-raconteur
        Feynman ever uttered a boring word.

        Another Friday:  We're working on a scheme to post Desperado as a
        moderated usenet thingamabob.  Should be interesting to see what
        the difference between class circulation (current method) and mass
        circulation (out there in sf_lovers land where "Close the pod bay
        doors, Hal" is still witty).  This ish will be posted there for
        them to "vote" on.  Hope we don't get "blackballed"!

        They already have a rec.humor.funny.  Is there a rec.humor.unfunny?
        .witty?  .dippy?  .shaggy?  We're not going for .humor anyway,
        we're going for rec.mag.desperado.

        We'll continue to distribute by mail also, of course.  And the idea
        of a moderated newsgroup is to make them come to me with their
        emendations, extensions, and lucubrations (lubricious, or not)
        rather than simply entering them on the spot.  And then, HA! HA!,
        I can reject them without explanation if I so choose!

        Over in the embryonic inculcation area, Desperado 3036 features
        hiloarious parodies of Unix and Mac programmer's manuals, my review
        of the "Soldier's Manual of Common Tasks", some keen stuff about
        haikus, at least three complaints about me, one from my own
        number-one son, along with a paragraph remarkably
        similar-to-yet-different-from this one about Desperado 3037, which
        has already begun the coral-reef-like process of Despergrowth.
