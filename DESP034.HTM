******************************************************************************
My two roommates and I spent Sat. evening at a friend's house with
Bob and Peter Grosso and another friend, Jim.  We all left our friend's at
the same time.  My roommates and I arrived home without incident;  at about
1 AM we were awakened by the phone and Bob and Peter told us the bizarre tale
which follows...

Subj:   As my Daddy said, this year can only get better!

And the saga continues.  Last month it was the 16-car pileup on an icy
bridge which near totaled my car, a case of being in the right place at the
wrong time.  This time however, trouble came and sought me out.

Saturday evening whilst returning from a friend's home in Nashua with my
brother Peter and my friend Jim, in the car which had been lent to me by the
autobody shop, we were rear-ended on Amherst Street.  As I pulled over to
assess damages and exchange civilities with this new acquaintance, my overtures
of friendliness were snubbed as the offending vehicle sped from the scene.
Although we copied the license plate number from the retreating vehicle, the
beer bottle waved out the window gave credence to the possibility that said
perpetrators might be in a stolen car, in which case, I would be left
responsible for property damages.

There was no question in my mind but that I would give pursuit.  I was driving
a 1972 Buick LeSabre with an enormous V8, two brand new tires on the front
and snow tires on the rear.  The goons didn't have a chance of getting away.
Whereas they were drunk and scared, I was sober and mad.  Since it was late at
night and traffic was light, I was not concerned about the possible jeopardy to
others on the road.  The driving of the fleeing vehicle was erratic and
reckless, so I did not press the pursuit closely, being content to keep them in
sight until they lost control of their vehicle.  At my brother's suggestion I
held the horn on, in expectation of potentially alerting the attention of the
Nashua Police.

I followed the car down a side street where they lost control at a corner and
spun around.  As I slowed my vehicle to a stop I realized to my horror that the
driver intended to ram me head on.  Apparently I was involved in an incident
which was more than I had bargained for.  I had expected two young punks whom
the three of us would have little trouble handling. Assured that my brother had
fastened his seat belt I braced myself and took the collision head on.  I
learned from my last accident that that is the way to minimize damage to the
frame of the car.  Fortunately the other car had little distance in which to
gain sufficient speed to decommission my vehicle.  After the impact I was
pleased to discover that I had better traction and the more powerful engine.
As the snow tires proceeded to tear up the tarmac, I drove the other vehicle
back against two trees, in the hopes of pinning him until the neighbors who
had been awakened by my incessant horn could alert the police.

Unfortunately, these efforts were too successful. I panicked the driver of the
other car.  He brandished a knife, yelling, "I've got a knife, back up or I'll
kill you".  His passenger courteously shared his beer with us by throwing the
bottle against my windshield.  This courtesy did nothing to calm me and I
continued to hold his vehicle pinned as my brother furiously kicked at the
passenger door with both feet. I still had enough presence of mind to suggest
he try exiting through the window.  As he sped to a nearby house to alert
police, the driver of the vehicle must still have thought we would back down.
Too bad I was so scared now at this point that I never even entertained the
thought. He must have gotten out of his car in expection that we were
abandoning ours.  I saw the knife he was waving, and I saw that this guy was
big. I rolled up the window Peter had exited and locked the door.  Under the
circumstances, not a very bright move as I had just closed Jim's and my route
of escape.

About this juncture in the narrative, everything begins to happen with such
rapidity, and Jim, Peter and I were so shook up that our actions were driven
purely by reflex.  Once Peter ascertained that neighbors had in fact alerted
the police, he began to search for something to use in defense.  Perhaps it was
his picking up a garbage can which triggered the other driver into desparate
action. The driver ran to my door and smashed his fist right through the
window.  Jim must have unlocked the passenger door, I didn't have time.  Peter,
on seeing the guy coming through my window with the knife, yanked open the door
which he previously couldn't kick open, as Jim and I fell out into the street.
While we fled to a safe distance, the passenger of the other car, backed mine
up, freeing their car, and then they sped off in their car.  Regrettably, there
was no time to think of taking the keys with me, and although they made the
same mistake, at this juncture, there was no thought of further pursuit.  I
didn't want to catch these guys.  As they departed, the driver took time to
flip up his license plate in an effort to conceal it, thus lending hope that it
was in fact, his vehicle.

Police arrived shortly thereafter.  Their response time was as good as could be
expected.  They responded with three vehicles which converged on the scene.
Since it wasn't all that late, about 11:15 on a Saturday night, my horn
attracted the attention of at least three local residents who witnessed the
entire incident, the ramming and attack. Police took pictures and statements
and recovered a piece of the other vehicle from the street. The kicker is this,
the computer in Concord was down and it would not be until Monday morning that
the police could attempt to trace and locate the owner of the vehicle.

Subject: A Final Solution for Unemployment in Detroit

On PBS's "All Things Considered" last night, there was a story about a
group of German writers that is sending food and other forms of relief
to Detroit.  According to the head of the group, this is in part a
gesture of gratitude for the generosity that the United States showed
to Germany following the war, and partially an attempt to point out
the contradiction inherent in a country that can spend billions and
trillions on defense, yet have people out of work and in desperate
straits in its cities.  He then went on to say something like this:
"One MX missle could solve all of Detroit's social problems."

I think he meant the money spent on one MX missle, but I'm not sure.

Subject: Even Dick Summer needs inspiration

Coincidences do happen, though I am not one of those people who ascribes
them to anything but randomness.  I just read in a recently-published
anthology of George O. Smith (an early science fiction writer whose work
I enjoyed much as an adolescent - it's a bit dated now) that the "one
hen, two ducks,..." nonsense originated in a military intelligence test,
the idea of which was to test short-term memory using something so
senseless that normal mnemonic aids would be useless.  While Dick seems
to have changed it around a bit for improved cadence, the source was
unmistakable.

The best references to Murphy's Law I ever saw was a series of Royal Air Force
posters aimed at Flight Line Engineers. Each depicted someone performing some
maintenance job on an aircraft and unknowingly demonstrating Murphy's Law to
the reader. Eg: Putting the wrong grade fuel in an aircraft because all the
connectors were the same no matter what the fuel was. Anyway the point is that
the posters only had two words on them:

"Chop meat" is clearly meat that is chops, not chopped.  An "old-fashion guy"
is, equally clearly, someone who likes (wears, perhaps?) old fashions.  Of
course, making off-the-wall interpretations like these can be hazardous to
your health, as, for example, assuming that someone having a gay time is a

The best American car of 1982:  The 1983 Firebird.  As a refined version of the
                                1982 Firebird, this car continues to amaze me.
                                The designers have reduced the drag coefficient
                                to less than 0.3; they could go farther if GM's
                                rules on engine cooling were not so strict.
                                The car handles and performs as well as can be
                                expected, what with smog motors and such, and
                                it is even quiet, comfortable, and reasonably
                                economical.  This commentary, by the bye, is
                                from a confirmed Honda owner.  Note that I do
                                not include the Camaro with the Firebird.  The
                                Chevy engineers had the opportunity to use the
                                fold-down headlights and they didn't do it; I
                                consider that decision a major styling blunder
                                as well as an engineering error (it increases
                                the drag significantly).

The best new computer of 1982:  The DEC personal computer series, and not just
                                because I am a DECie (or a Digit, or whatever).

The best political cartoon:     The January 2, 1983, "Doonesbury."  It was, af-
                                ter all, drawn in 1982...

The best cartoon of any sort:   "Bloom County" with all its continuing
insanity. Anyone wishing to intergurn at me for any of these choices
knows where I can be reached.

The best rock concert of the year: Elvis Costello at the Cape Cod Coliseum.
This guy has *star* quality and writes good songs too.  The minute he
peeped out from behind the amp with a shy sly look on his face sold me
completely and his shy little smiles - Elvis Costello? - his crack
band, The Attrractions - his mix of old stuff and new - it was a hell
of a show.

Worst warmup act of the year:  Dead heat between Talk Talk at the
Costello concert and the dreadful (little joke there) reggae band that
opened for The Clash in Providence.

Despite a few experiments, I find myself unable to call him Elvis, so
I call him Costello.  What ever happened to Elton Motello, by the way?

Subject: Our plural

I think it's nice for people to acknowledge Spanish by spelling the
word DESPERADOS. However, the actual Spanish word is "desesperados."
The prefix des- means "without," "lacking," "opposite of," and so forth,
like the English dis-. The verb "esperar" means "to hope for," "to
expect," "to wait for," and so forth. "Esperado" is usually the past
participle, as in "Hace muchos meses que han esperado el dinero" (they've
been expecting the money for many months). Un hombre desesperado
is a person without hope or expectations for the future, such as an
outlaw who can't hope to be forgiven or to live a normal life. Spanish
tends, even more than English, to use participles as nouns, too, so this
person is also called simply a desesperado. Another topical case is the
new Argentine word desaparecido, meaning someone who is not likely to appear
again (having, for instance, been dropped into the Rio de la Plata from
a helicopter).

The word "desperado" is actually a contraction invented by English speakers
in the old days, like "lariat" for "la reata." After some brief discomfort,
I grew comfortable with the spelling DESPERADOES because it seems to
emphasize the true origins of the word. I'm reminded of one of my favorite
Thurber cartoons: A man and woman are sitting in their armchairs, in
what should be a scene of domestic stability. The man is saying, "With
you, Lida, I have known peace, and now you say you're going crazy."

        There are 7 conventional parts of speech (you should see what
the modern grammarians can do tho), and the pronouns, conjuctions, and
prepositions are closed finite sets, except for slang. I don't see how
anybody is going to beat "home" as "The Word that is the Most Parts of
Speech".
        I think there's more promise in searching for the word(s)
with the most diverse meanings (like "sanction" which is its own antonym),
or the greatest number of different meanings (I think the winner is "set").

I nominate "jack" as the word with the most meanings, with "dog" close
