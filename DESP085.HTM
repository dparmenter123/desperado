Folks,

I'm doing what I can to keep them Desperados coming, but I have to do
what I'm paid for first.  If you have sent me stuff and wondered if
and when I'd ever use it, well, that's what happens whenever you send
me something, but it's worse towards the end of a release.  Micro/RSX
marches on.  Desperado always slips.

I'm thinking of more frequent, shorter editions.

Also, despite requests from many sources, Desperado remains an
underground DEC employe benefit.  If you ask me to add a subscriber
outside the company, I won't.

I hope you're all being discrete about forwarding Desperados.  As the
ghastly, stupid chain letter I've gotten (and refused to forward)
three copies of indicates, the network world is here, and anything
*you* forward on-line can get *me* into trouble.

What are the words to the Patty Duke show??   I have the first verse
and the chorus, but I lack the other verse(s).   Any insight into this

Americans call budgerigars parakeets.  Australians call Australia Oz.

From: SNO78A::HUGHES
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER

The discussions on varmint-removal remind me of the great Australian
sport of budgie-bricking (a budgie, or budgerigar (not sure of that
spelling) is a small parrot type of thing that some people keep as
pets for some reason - noisy messy things as far as I can tell).
Anyhow, budgie-bricking requires that you bring two house bricks
together at some speed with the budgie in between (does it hust I hear
you ask...only if you get your thumbs in the way). Expert mode
requires the use of only one brick.

So, if you are ever in Australia and you see someone standing around,
holding a brick and calling "Here budgie, budgie" (or the alternate method,
holding a budgie in your hand and calling out "Here brick, brick"), you
will know what is going on.

Likewise, if ever spot someone in greater Boston standing in their garden
with a brick...I will know what is going on.

To:   PARMENTER

The latest (Fall 1983) issue of CoEvolution Quarterly (from the people
who brought us the &lt;nth&gt; Whole Earth Catalogue) suggests "Gecko as
Roach-deterrent". A gecko is a nocturnal, insect-eating lizard,
described as a "polite, cleanly addition to the home". The author
bought two of the seven-inch version (half of which is tail) and
claims that his household population of roaches is steadily declining.
Check it out.

Geckos live only in hot climates.  The lizards wander around in the
dark eating insects.  Every time they eat one, you hear a chitinous
click.

Subject: Our friend Nikola

For all those Nikola Tesla admirers out there in Deperadoland, how
about this?

Nikola spent his last years after his parting of the ways with Thomas
Edison right here in Colorado Springs, as most of you know, doing
experiments with wireless transmissions of energy.  In fact, he once
blew out a rather large, rather expensive generator owned by the city.

During recent excavations for expansion of the Colorado School for
Deaf and Blind, the contractors came accross the remnants of what is
believed to be Tesla's laboratory in which he conducted most of his
experiments.  Right now, it's not known what's going to be done with
all this, but there is a movement to have a Nikola Tesla Appreciation
Day/Week/Month/Year here in the Springs sometime soon.  For those
Desperadi who would like to be kept aware of the plans surrounding
this, send mail to TSC::MOLSON::OREILLY, and I'll try to keep track of
things.

I met the "Mad Hacker" at Decus and found him to be large, blonde, and

excavations.

I also heard a rumor at Decus that Tokio Rose was warming up her
transmitter for another round of rumor and ruin.

Subject: New Holidays...

Desperado readers in Europe who have followed the news of the
new holiday in the U.S. (and who have always been amazed by the
comparative lack of holidays and vacation in the U.S.) may find
it interesting that (in this Desperado's opinion) Digital will
not pick up this holiday.

Currently the Roxbury (the plant Ronnie visited in Boston) observes
this holiday as the "location choice" holiday instead of Patriot's
Day (which is otherwise only observed in Massachusetts and Maine).

Digital already ignores several Federal holidays: George Washington's
birthday, Columbus Day, and Veterans' Day choosing to do what in most
cases seems more reasonable -- to observe the Friday after Thanks-
giving and, depending on the date of Christmas and New Year's, to
provide a longer weekend around those days.

A comparison of the types of holidays is interesting:  In the U.S.,
Christmas Day is the ONLY religious holiday (and some may argue that
Christmas is not observed as a religious holiday in this country).

In Germany (or actually Bavaria, which has the most), of the fourteen
legal holidays, only three are not religious holidays:  (May Day, Day
of German Unity, and New Year's Day -- which some may argue is a
religious holiday: Feast of the Circumcision).

And as long as we are on the subject of time off -- one wonders when/if
the U.S. will ever come around to allowing the amount of vacation time
which Europeans get.  Most countries provide five to six weeks of
vacation.  France requires DEC to give employees an extra eight
days of vacation over and above the normal 5 1/2 weeks because
employees are required to put in a full 40 hour week, rather than
the 39 hours which is the legal work week.

Subject: Disgusting node/user names

The machine was an Ed Services machine.  Most of Europe is of the
opinion that naming nodes by function/location is "better" than our
"cutesy" naming scheme.  Thus that machine is Ed Services machine
number four.

There should be no reason for giving users silly numeric IDs, but
apparently Ed Services sets up a bunch of accounts for each course
without regard for the actual users, then gives out a list of
pre-existing accounts at the beginning of the class.

I was there too.   I won $262.50 at the quarter slots and $110.00 at
the Roulette tables.   I felt compelled to give most of it back, but
did come away with enough to cover the miscellaneous expenses for the
week.   It all seemed so insignificant when a foreigner won $190,000
(That's right, one-hundred-ninety-THOUSAND) dollars at the craps
table, and the $500.00 minimum 21 table with two armed guards standing
by it with ONE person dropping several tens of $500 tokens on every
round.   He wasn't winning.   Must have been the casino's way of
getting their $190,000 back.

I figured it out in about two days.   The best description I could
come up with was "Concrete, Steel, Glass, Plastic and Spandex"

By the way, there are NO clocks in the casinos, and even the clocks in
the "Clock Shop" were not right (save for one, but in order to know
which one, you had to look at your watch)  I wonder if it was a city
ordinance?

Also, DEC is really big in several of the casinos.   At the Las Vegas
Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton there is a real-time RSTS (Or it used
to be) system coupled with LOTS of LSI-11's which monitor the slot
machines.   They know EXACTLY what comes in and what goes out when
they get emptied and if there is any difference, someone has lots of
explaining to do.   Rumor had it that about 15% of the crew quit when
the system came on line about 4 or 5 years ago.   Bally Corp,
manufacturer of the majority of the slot machines in the world hired
Ted Sarbin (Real RSTS freaks know who he is) to finish the job.

Subject: The Birds

Ever felt vaguely miffed at those folks who park their shiny new cars
in the farthest reaches of the parking lots, placing them diagonally in
the (usually vain) hope that no one will dent them?

Last week I was strolling through the ZK parking lot, enjoying the
autumn weather, when I noticed a commotion at the far end of the lot.
Approaching the scene, I discovered a very large, glossy black crow
having a noisy fight with the sport mirror of a (diagonally-parked)
blue Toyota! He was hanging on to the mirror bracket and flapping
his wings, and making quite a racket; obviously, the intruder in the
mirror was causing him to lose face.

The crow would lose his hold on the mirror every now and then, and would
flap up to the top of the car and try to crane his neck (so to speak) to
see the reflection; he'd hop around on the roof for a while, cursing in
crow, and then he'd go for the mirror again. When I left, he was still
hanging in there, but he was gone when I left the plant that night;
whether he thought he won, or just gave up, I'll never know.

I wonder if crow-claws can scratch a car's finish, and if so, did the
owner realize what had happened - or does he or she think that it was
the work of vandals, their attention drawn to the shiny cars in the
far reaches of the lot ...
