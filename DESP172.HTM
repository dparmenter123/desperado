            "Out of the night when the full moon is bright,
            Comes a horseman known as Zorro.
            This bold renegade carves a Zee with his blade,
            A Zee that stands for Zorro."

Hello everybody.  I'm back.  BFD, right?  You bet.

Many and profound and inexpressible thanks to Therry Neilsen-Steinhardt,
who thought she had a lifetime to get tired of doing this, but underwent a
reverse slip and got tired sooner than she planned.  In the meantime, the
fairy who takes care of all Desperados, good and bad alike, had caused me
(a/k/a Our Flounder) to come back to DEC and accept the baton.

Therry and I talked about killing it off, refocusing on conference-room
whiteboards as the medium of choice, skywriting, fortune cookies, mattress
tags, faces in tortillas, runes, vegetable letters, albums of song
parodies, milk cartons, footsteps in the snow, semaphore signals,
table-rapping, pipe-tapping, or notes left between the pages of hymnals,
but after all that consideration here I am back at the old stand dealing
out free-verse hamburgers and loose apothegms like they were going out of
style, which, no doubt, they are.  Chiliasm, the next big trend.  You read
it here first.

I'll tell you more about how different everything really is in a future
issue, but for now, note that the major change is a definite reduction in
DIGITAL-specific material so I can justify sending it out to all my buddies
who work elsewhere on the net.  (When necessary, if necessary, I'll do a
Company-Confidential edition, but for the most part, free for all here at
Liberty Hall.)

Older Desperados will recall the enormous amount of numerological
significance that was attached to my departure from DEC and will note with
awe that my new hire-date is the determinedly non-octal, but alimentarily
evocative
                                   8-8-88.

So, here we go.

Best wishes, cranky as ever,
your buddy,

Tom Parmenter

The Surgeon General's performance in stopping smoking has been rated pretty
much peachy keen, but my recent (semi-voluntary) removal from a nonsmoking
environment (Symbolics) to a smoking-barely-tolerated environment (DEC) has
made me aware of one troubling failure of this policy.

While the adult smoking population has dropped from over 60 percent of all
adults to under 30 percent, and while the pariah-dog treatment of smokers
is approaching the Thugee/Dacoitry level, there has been a shocking and
inexplicable rise in tobacco-smoke allergies.

In the unenlightened past when cigarette-smoking was universal and
cigar-smoking was more common than cigarette-smoking is now, the incidence
of tobacco-smoke allergies was .03 per 100,000, but now that smoking is
engaged in less and less by an evermore despised and dispersed minority,
tobacco-smoke allergy is endemic.

Not only is it endemic, it is much more virulent than ever before.  The
allergic person's health can be threatened by one cigarette being consumed
some 30 yards away, in the unenlightened, but apparently healthier past,
the nonsmoker's motto was "Blow some my way."

And what happened to all the cuspidors?  Where are the tobacco-abusers
supposed to spit?

After several years of dogged experimentation, Chester Carlson of New York
produced the first xerographic copy at his laboratory in Astoria, Queens,
on October 22.  The ordinary-looking piece of waxed paper simply read
"10-22-38 Astoria," but it represented a technological breakthrough that
would at last satisfy the reproductive urges of office workers everywhere.

Synopsis of film shown at MFA on the 23rd of September:

The sequel to `Black Cannon Incident', `Dislocation' by Huang Jianxin
(1987, 96 minutes) is a science fiction saga of a downtrodden
engineer's struggle to become a top-notch executive.  His innovations
earn him a chrome and plastic fantasy office, a secretary and a
chauffer-driven car.  However, he is forced to attend so many
pointless meetings that he can't get on with his work.  His solution
is to construct a robot to attend meetings for him.  All is well until
the robot rebels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I finally found a 1948 reprint of Audels Carpenters and Builders Guide
    (4 volumes) last week. These volumes contain among the greatest amount
    of practical and useful information I have seen in any set of books.
    The books are out of print, but may be found occasionally at antique
    and used book stores. I paid $20 for my set, while a friend in Illinois
    paid $25 for a set.

    Given the age of the books, they lean heavily toward hand tools and
    hand production methods. I have used the books both for practical
    reference of such things as construction techniques (both building and
    furniture), load and bearing limit tables, etc., and for reference when
    trying to identify the intended use of a few curious antique tools.

    The frontispiece speaks of an attitude which seems to be almost entirely
    missing in today's work:

         When we build, let us think that we build forever. Let it not
         be for present delight nor for present use alone. Let it be
         such work as our descendants will thank us for; and let us
         think as we lay stone upon stone, that a time is to come when
         those stones will be held sacred because our hands have
         touched them, and that men will say, as they look upon the
         labor and wrought substance of them, "See! This our father
         did for us."

And finally, a note from Therry, and NOT her last contribution to Desperado:

Desperadim, I am packing it in. It's been a great three and a half
years, but the divine afflatus is no longer upon me. There is nothing
like documenting a V1.0 product to realign one's priorities.  Why, I
barely have time to listen to the rock and roll lyrics that have been
furnishing us with headlines.

                     MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

          When Marcus Aurelius and I were callow youths, we did a
          stint in Lawrence, Kansas at KU ("Rock chalk, jay hawk, go
          KU!) We had no money; our only amusement was filling up the
          car with gasoline at 23 cents a gallon and driving around,
          reading aloud to one another. He is a good reader; he was
          reading Scott's The Lady of the Lake to me, and when we got
          to the line "These are Clan Alpine's warriors true/ and
          Saxon, *I* am Roderick Dhu", I drove off the road into a
          cornfield.

          We finally fulfilled the promise of our early days. The two
          of us just came home from two weeks in Scotland;
          a week in Edinburgh at the largest music, art, and
          drama festival in the world, and a week wandering around
          the North of Scotland. Here are a few vignettes from our
          travels:

          1. Watching a seven-foot tall countertenor costumed as a
             Chaldean astologer loom out of the backlit misty dark-
             ness of Greyfriars Kirk during a performance of Daniel
             and the Lions, the medieval morality play. To hear that
             unearthly sound come from that unearthly body gave us
             our first hint that we had somehow left the planet as
             we know it.

             And the sight of the lion did nothing to dispel that im-
             pression. Roughly the size of a Ford Aerostar, born aloft
             by three black-costumed dancers (one each for two sep-
             arate, well-clawed paws and the third for the massive,
             bemaned head), it menaced the front row of the audience,roaring
             a roar that shook the piers of the chancel. An angel ap-
             peared, bearing a wiggly sword like a snickersnee, and
             brought it to all six of its knees.

             The Festival wasn't all cheap sensation, of course, I
             did hear a viola recital and a Victorian musicale and
             two operas (sort of) and Jorma Hynninen singing Sibelius
             lieder and a performance of Midsummer Night's Dream that
             featured a setting of the song Ye Spotted Snakes with
             Double Tongue that could take its place on WFNX with no
             questions asked.

          2. Edinburgh and Stirling both have imposing castles on the
             top of glacial hills, and Edinburgh also has Holyrood
             House, former home of Mary Queen of Scots. All three,
             like most places in Scotland, are known by who was mur-
             dered there. At Holyrood, there is even a brass plaque
             to mark the spot where Mary's favorite, David Rizzio,
             handed in his dinner pail. At her feet, so the story goes.
             Marcus Aurelius was much impressed by Rizzio's end, but
             my own favorite murder took place at Stirling Castle.
             There's a nice little garden at the end of a passage,
             overlooking the surrounding countryside. It's known as
             the Douglas Gardens, Lord Douglas having landed there
             after James II murdered him at dinner and flung his body
             out of the window. Then there's always the Drummond sis-
             ters, all three poisoned by disgruntled nobles who wanted
             James IV to repudiate the eldest one, his favorite at
             the time, and marry some respectable English princess.
             I'll skip lightly over the various massacres.

          3. Bagpipers coming out of the haggis! Kid in a bright green
             Mohawk playing a pibroch, a long, weird, wailing lament;
             handsome young man playing "Will Ye No Come Back Again",
             while an eight-year-old kid sang along and matched him
             ornament for ornament; wild-eyed young men in plaids,
             which is the Highland predecessor of the kilt, playing
             the Highland predecessor of the bagpipes. The plaid is
             fourteen yards of primitive tartan; you lay it out on
             the ground, pleat it here and there and then roll your-
             self up in it. It streamed behind these two like a bat-
             tle flag, leading me to wonder what happened when some
             enterprising foe stuck a pike into it. Add long hair in
             a pigtail, an old yellow dog, a two-handed sword and a
             tiny round shield called a targe. From which the word
             'target' uncomfortably derives.

             And a troop of pipers marching down Princes Street, pre-
             ceded by smiling cops on prancing horses; my eyes fill
             with tears, and my fists itch for a claymore.

          4. Getting trapped on Princes Street by half the popula-
             tion of Edinburgh, turned out to watch the Glenlivet Fire-
             works Display, a two-hour production performed to the
             sounds of Handel played by the Scottish National Orches-
             tra. And broadcast over the Beeb, and further broadcast
             out of every window along every street in the neighbor-
             hood. Loud shrieks of "OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAAAAH-
             HHHHHH!" Fireworks the universal language. Finally strug-
             gled home along the slightly raffish Rose Street, gut-
             ters running with Scotch and delicious Edinburgh ice cream.
             Those Scots do live.

          5. Our favorite object at the Museum of Antiquities: among
             the Bonnie Prince Charlie relics, examples of Edinburgh
             silversmithing, beakers courtesy of the Beaker People,
             and paisley shawls, we found a set of twelfth-century
             Norse chesspersons, each wearing a woeful face full of
             late medieval angst. The pawns are depicted as Berserk-
             ers, each chewing a tiny leather-edged shield. Postcard
             in my office; drop by anytime.

          6. Twisting through the streets of Dollar in our little rental
             car to cries of "Mind yer left!" from the passenger. The
             cheerful Burn of Sorrow runs its brown and noisy route
             through the streets while far above the town, which used
             to be called Dolor, the dread Castle Doom drees its weird.
             Our first glimpse of the tall fortress comes through dead
             trees; virtually all you can see is the fluttering ban-
             ner of Scotland at the top of its five-story tower. We
             end up negotiating the last quarter mile to the castle
             hand over hand. The Campbells, whose fortress Castle Doom
             used to be, were a businesslike lot, responsible for a
             large number of crimes against hospitality, including
             the Massacre at Glencoe. Just outside the beetle-browed
             Great Hall is a pit prison; slide somebody into that and
             let them listen to the grunts and cries for more uisque-
             beach from the banqueting hall just outside their ou-
             bliette. Don't drop in on Campbells.

          7. Seeking shelter from a proper deluge in the driest thing
             we could scare up: a distillery. This distillery boasted
             a cat named Towser, who held the world's record for mouse-
             catching: in excess of 30,000 in the course of a long
             and illustrious career of 24 years. She now resides with
             the morning stars, regretted by all. Except the mice.

          8. Lifelist additions: chaffinch, visible largely from park-
             ing lots; hooded crow, an interesting gray crow with black
             wings and head; gray heron, rather like a great blue but
             duller; a red-throated diver; house martins skimming the
             surface of the swollen Tay, diving through the arches
             of Thomas Telford's beautiful 1812 bridge at Dunkeld;
             and of course the bird they think is a robin, half the
             size of our robin. We would look something up in great
             excitement, only to find it described as "quite the com-
             monest sort of finch". Not to us!

          9. Palaces in Scotland are rarely older than the fifteenth
             century, because Robert the Bruce slighted most of the
             older ones. You get a little grumped with the Bruce when
             your object is castles, but it doesn't do to say so. The
             Bruce may have slighted the medieval castles, but he left
             the oldest sites alone. We saw Rough Castle, a Roman fort,
             near Stirling, and Clava Cairns, a Stone Age burial site,
             near Inverness.

             Rough Castle is a huge Roman camp on the Antonine wall,
             built to supplant Hadrian's Wall. What's left is an acre
             of ditches, formidable earthworks, and a causeway. We
             were there with a young family and an older chap with
             an ancient, creaking Golden Retriever and the most im-
             penetrable burr I've ever heard. Young family scrambled
             up the earth wall and went haring around the campsite,
             young dad turning to us and remarking cheerfully "Ye need
             a guid imagination, don't ye!" Older Chap points out the
             salient (pun intended) features, including the lilies,
             a group of 12-foot deep pits with sharpened stakes at
             the bottom, positioned just outside the gates. "Fa' doon
             ane o' those, ye'd no be climbin' oot agane!" he said
             with relish. And over the whole camp, the most dizzy-
             ingly sweet fragrance, of hundreds of wild heliotrope
             flowers.

             I'm still reluctant to talk about Clava Cairns, because
             I'm still spooked, frankly. Three ancient stone passage
             graves, made of heaps of stones, surrounded by curb stones
             carved with cup and ring ornaments. The graves are sur-
             rounded by standing stone rings, and it's very quiet and
             rather cold. Easier to talk about the little old lady
             we saw stealing apples from the adjacent orchard, but
             since we were stealing blackberries from the hedges our-
             selves...

          10.We landed on the Isle of Skye in a howling gale, and fought
             our way up the sheltered (hah!) west coast of the is-
             land, seeing only glimpses of the last wilderness in Eu-
             rope, the Cuillin Mountains. The Skye sheep are renowned
             for the wild originality of their countenances, and they
             were everywhere; beside the road, *in* the road, halfway
             up the impossible craggy slopes of the Cuillins. Only
             one stood morosely pressing her black and white nose to
             the door of the sheepshed, the picture of woe.

             Marcus Aurelius was determined to see a broch, a Bronze
             Age hill fort. There's a handsome one on the Isle of Skye,
             and thither we struck. Looks like the bottom of a round
             tower built of rough stone. It's not very tall, but el-
             egantly engineered: a double wall with a staircase in-
             side. When your lookouts hallooed of longboats, you'd
             bundle your village inside it, leaving the sheep in the
             inner court, and climbing the walls to hurl offensive
             materials at marauders. Considering just how offensive
             sheep can be, you could call the broch a perfectly bal-
             anced ecosystem. Between a meadow full of sheep, their
             offensive material, and the winds howling across 3000 miles
             of ocean, we had a hard time breaching the walls our-
             selves.

          11.Loch Ness! Didn't see the monster; she was out being a
             bunch of logs, or the mirage known as Looming, or folie
             a deux, or mass hysteria or something. She has often been
             sighted from the ruins of the largest castle in Scot-
             land, Castle Urquhart (which, you will remember from Lo-
             cal Hero, is pronounced Urkutt). The Bruce had nothing
             to do with the destruction of this one; the inhabitants
             blew it up themselves in 1692 to prevent its falling into
             the Wrong Hands. Enough of it remains to give you a won-
             derful idea of the sort of things that went on in a cas-
             tle, like keeping doves, and going to church, and draw-
             ing water, and dropping things on passersby. Since Nessie
             is fond of the place, tours often stop by to check out
             the loch, a beautiful former fjord. On hand for their
             entertainment was a tall handsome piper with a formidable
             mustache, busking for shilling in the parking lot above
             the castle. But the National Trust keeps a soldier to
             the castle, and he leaned on a ruined wall, listening
             raptly to the music, until he saw us looking at him. He
             shook himself like a cat who has fallen off a sofa.

          12.There's always something to see out a Scottish window:

             Sitting in the window embrasure of our nice hotel in Ed-
             inburgh, drinking a cup of lapsang souchong and watch-
             ing the sun on the otherwise brooding towers of Edin-
             burgh Castle. (icon for breathing on fingernails and pol-
             ishing them on shoulder of sweater, the while wearing
             a smug grin).

             Sitting in a window embrasure at Linlithgow Palace, look-
             ing down on the approach to the castle, winding through
             the graceful gate, and idly imagining a dinner party at
             Linlithgow, the butler scuttling around, while host and
             hostess watch out the front window and yell at the
             guests "Yoo hoo! I declare, it's just so good to *see*
             you! Come right on in!"

             Sitting in the window embrasure of our hotel on the Isle
             of Skye, drinking a cup of lapsang souchong, watching
             the little islands in the bay of Portree. Watching them
             sit like cats in the sun, watching them vanish into im-
             prenetrable fog, watching them emerge from the mists as
             the fog turned to a blistering downpour. In the space
             of four and a half minutes by my watch.

             Sitting in another window embrasure at Linlithgow Palace,
             watching a sailing lesson in the loch below the palace.
             We watched luffing and jibing from the windows of the
             Great Hall, open to the Heavens, filled with light and
             wind and pigeons being blown from one side to the other.
             The Palace is five stories high, lacks roof, is filled
             with terrifying spiral staircases and sawhorses telling
             you not to go any further (hah!), and is the only palace
             we saw that had flying buttresses.

             Sitting at the window of our hotel in Inverness, drink-
             ing a cup of lapsang souchong, watching the light fade
             from the stonebuilt Victorian facades across the river.
             The Ness races quietly past, the trees whisper in the
             evening wind. It begins to rain.

          13.Italian doctors have identified a syndrome they call Stend-
             halism, the symptoms of which include fainting, dizzi-
             ness, and disorientation. The 19th centrury French nov-
             elist exhibited these symptoms when he first visited Flo-
             rence. He was apparently overcome by the proximity of
             so much great art.

             What I want to know is, can you call it Stendhalism if
             you are overcome by magnificent scenery. virtually de-
             void of the hand of man? We drove from Mallaig to Fort
             William, and every time we drove around a corner, we would
             be stunned to find yet another vista of mountains, lochs,
             trees, you name it. The end came at Glenfinnan, where
             Bonnie Prince Charlie summoned the Clans to join him in
             restoring his father, the Old Pretender, to the throne
             of Scotland. Picture, please, magnificently craggy cloud-
             topped mountains, flanks glistening with a recent rain,
             little white clouds scudding across a blue sky, a loch
             sparkling in the sun, studded here and there with is-
             lands topped with graceful trees waving in a gentle breeze,
             a noble old house on the banks, its outlines obscured
             by bright red Virginia creeper vines, and an early nine-
             teenth century railroad bridge, many-arched, built of
             mellow old stone. Over the bridge chuffed a small, bright-
             green steam engine, pulling six carriages and trailing
             clouds of steam, and occasionally emitting a picturesque
             hoot that echoed across the valley. When the train dis-
             appeared into a glen, an F14 on practice maneuvers tore
             across the sky about 200 feet over our heads. We had to
             lie down and have someone bathe our temples with laven-
             der water.

          14.On our last day, we visited yet one more fine old cas-
             tle, that of Doune. And it was raining, as it was so of-
             ten. And the caretaker of the castle was off somewhere,
             and we had to wait 45 minutes to get into this 14th cen-
             tury castle (how the Bruce missed it, I don't know). We
             walked around damply, admiring the two rivers that run
             past the castle, whispering and rippling in the increas-
             ing downpour. Finally I went back to the car and sat lis-
             tening to piano trios on the Beeb and thinking dark thoughts
             about the caretaker in his warm, dry little wherever,
             having his tea.

             We did finally achieve the castle, notable for having
             been neither blown up or improved over the centuries.
             The Great Hall had old leaded glass windows in poor re-
             pair, melted or broken, but one had a little opening to
             let in the fresh air. Three swallows sat on the ledge
             of this opening, determined to stay dry, chattering and
             scolding and flapping at any other swallow that aspired
             to perch. One shouldered past the them and flew around
             the Great Hall, swooping and dipping.

          15.Time to pack it in, check in the rental car, make our
             way to a pleasant hotel near the airport, and have our
             dinner of venison and guinea hen, overlooking a sopping
             wet croquet game in a garden that tells you why you could
             learn to put up with the sozzle.
