    Clawed pepper:

    The recently late Claude Pepper died as a House memeber, but had also
    been a senator.  He was bounced from the Senate by a red-baiting
    opponent who termed him "Red Pepper" for his liberal views.  All's fair
    in politics, but Pepper really got screwed in this election.  The
    Florida voters were dismayed to learn that Pepper was "a practicing
    extrovert", that he had "matriculated" at the university, and, worst of
    all, that his sister was a "thespian".  His campaign never recovered
    from these vicious attacks.  Claude showed 'em, however.  He went off
    and became a millionaire lawyer and then came back into the House
    twelve years later and devoted the rest of his life to promulgating the
    proposition that Social Security was an insurance program and not a
    Ponzi scheme.

    The computer business is the opposite of the fish business, where the
    little fish is eaten by the bigger fish who is eaten by the bigger
    fish, ad infinitem.  We have to worry about the littler guy.  In this
    month's Games Magazine, two new user interfaces are announced.  One is
    a glove that permits you to control the system by waving your fingers;
    the other is a sort of zone in front of the screen where you wave your
    hands around significantly.

    And, in last week's Wall Street Journal, Nintendo stated that it is
    following a Trojan-horse strategy, very successfully.  Approximately 30
    per cent of all American homes have one of their computers in place.
    Good color graphics and sound, real-time response, and millions of
    trained users, all without a sign of Unix, and on an eight-bit machine
    built to be upgraded into a more obvious computer.

    Nintendo spent the first hundred years of its existence as a
    playing-card manufacturer.  Sounds like they know how to play poker,
    for sure.

    If you feel like to do something to contribute directly to the
    Pro-democracy movement in China, there is an opportunity that you can
    make a personal impact. Let me be more specific.

    The Boston Chinese Students( Harvard, MIT, ETC ) have established an
    Information Exchange Center near Newton with the help of a local
    religious organization called WALKER ECUMENICAL CENTER. This
    Information Exchange Center relays Pro-democracy information all over
    the world to many Chinese cities by telephones and FAX machine. It also
    receives information/rumors from those cities through personal
    contacts. I made a vist to this center yesterday and found its
    operation very effective. If you would like to know more it, please
    call the center directly at 617-969-3919.

    The contribution that you could make is to help the Information
    Exchange Center pay its phone bills. The bills have been accumulated to
    about $25K over the past few weeks and still growing. Many are collect
    calls from China.

    Your donation is tax deductible. Please make chect payable to "WALKER
    ECUMENICAL CENTER" 144 HANCOCK ST. AUBURNDALE, MA 02166. Please mark
    the memo line on your check with "FOR CHINA PHONE BILLS".

Subj:   Engineers as Professionals

&gt;       ...a cheap, deceptive attempt to take advantage of the professional
&gt;       reputation and image developed by real engineers over a century or
&gt;       so without acquiring a comparable level of professional knowledge,
&gt;       qualification, and capability.

        Not to be confused with the unprofessional reputation and image
        propagated by members of the engineering "fraternity"? It's true
        that Professional Engineers have to go through training, exams, and
        review boards, but that doesn't stop some real winners from getting
        their PE stamps.  My favorite was the bozo my ex-husband had to
        deal with, who designed a sprinkler system for a 60 lb water
        pressure, because the two sources at the site were 20 and 40 PSI,
        respectively.

                                    BY
                                ROBERT WALSER

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    ESTEEMED GENTLEMEN,

    I am a poor, young, unemployed person in the business field, my name is
    Wenzel, I am seeking a suitable position, and I take the liberty of
    asking you, nicely and politely, if perhaps in your airy, bright,
    amiable rooms such a position might be free.  I know that your good
    firm is large, proud, old, and rich, thus I may yield to the pleasing
    supposition that a nice, easy, pretty little place would be available,
    into which, as into a kind of warm cubbyhole, I can slip.  I am
    excellently suited, you should know, to occupy just such a modest
    haven, for my nature is altogether delicate, and I am essentially a
    quiet, polite, and dreamy child, who is made to feel cheerful by people
    thinking of him that he does not ask for much, and allowing him to take
    possession of a very, very small patch of existence, where he can be
    useful in his own way and thus feel at ease.  A quiet, sweet, small
    place in the shade has always been the tender substance of my dreams,
    and if now the illusions I have about you grow so intense as to make me
    hope that my dream, young and old, might be transformed into delicious,
    vivid reality, then you have, in me, the most zealous and most loyal
    servitor, who will take it as a matter of conscience to discharge
    precisely and punctually all his duties.  Large and difficult tasks I
    cannot perform, and obligations of a far-ranging sort are too strenuous
    for my mind.  I am not particularly clever, and first and foremost I do
    not like to strain my intelligence overmuch.  I am a dreamer rather
    than a thinker, a zero rather than a force, dim rather than sharp.
    Assuredly there exists in your extensive institution, which I imagine
    to be overflowing with main and subsidiary functions and offices, work
    of the kind that one can do as in a dream? -- I am, to put it frankly,
    a Chinese; that is to say, a person who deems everything small and
    modest to be beautiful and pleasing, and to whom all that is big and
    exacting is fearsome and horrid.  I know only the need to feel at my
    ease, so that each day I can thank God for life's boon, with all its
    blessings.  The passion to go far in the world is unknown to me.
    Africa with its deserts is not to me more foreign. Well, so now you
    know what sort of a person I am. -- I write, as you see, a graceful and
    fluent hand, and you need not imagine me to be entirely without
    intelligence.  My mind is clear, but it refuses to grasp things that
    are many, or too many by far, shunning them.  I am sincere and honest,
    and I am aware that this signifies precious little in the world in
    which we live, so I shall be waiting, esteemed gentlemen, to see what
    it will be your pleasure to reply to your respectful servant,
    positively drowning in obedience,

                                                                    Wenzel

    Re the "shoulders-of-giants" quote: a notoriously witty Harvard
    physicist, Sidney Coleman, explains that Newton had an ego; what he had
    *meant* to say was, "If I have seen farther than others, it's because
    I've been surrounded by midgets."

Notoriously witty, indeed.  We used to call him "El Sid", because of his
literary upper-crust humor.

Example: once he wanted to raise a window shade, but someone had tied
the string attached to it in a truly impressive knot.  "I see that
Gordius has preceded me here, and I, Alexander, have left my sword at
home."

The first problem set in his relativistic quantum field theory class
started out with a quote from Paracelsus: "He who can do nothing, knows
nothing."

    Survival Research Labs:
        "Illusions of Shameless Abundance Degenerating into
         an Uninterrupted Sequence of Hostile Encounters"
    28 May 89, San Francisco

The event was held underneath the 80 Freeway, between Third and Fourth
Streets.  I'm not good at crowd numbers, but I'd guess that there were
around 5000 people there.  Especially the San Francisco art crowd.
The Lucid contingent numbered about ten.

The staging area was large, decorated with artsy black and white
prints and aluminum foil.  There were torches that consisted of pieces
of 2-inch diameter Plexiglass (or similiar material) that just burned
at one end.  There were dead animal carcasses and assorted rancid meat
hanging from the two west corners, flanking a large painted cloth.
There were two large hanging blue cornucopias filled with fish and
rotting fruit.  There was a pyramid of 15 or so old upright pianos,
and a single upright piano hanging from a rope in the center.  Other
bits of artwork, sculpture, and randomness were present.

Recorded music at the beginning of the event included bagpipe music,
Sousa marches, concert band marches, and tapes of random phone
conversations.

The first robot looked like a dinosaur skelaton, or a giraffe, but
much larger.  A wheel in back, two non-movable feet in front, and a
working jaw atop a working neck.  It moved by applying pressure to the
ground with it's jaw, lifting it's front paws off the ground.  It's
motions looked like a dinasaur would look.  It started munching on one
of the suspended cornucopias, and when the contents spilled out,
munched on the stuff on the ground.

Nearby was a 4-wheeled device with a junkyard electromagnet.  It would
bop around the stage picking things up and moving them around.

An air cannon was on the other side.  Remember those Mattel bazookas
from around 1967 that shot loud blasts of air?  Well, this was bigger.
Six 12-foot long, 1 foot diameter PVC tubes mounted together.  At the
business end of each one was a fuel/cylinder/sparkplug contraption
that could be remotely aimed and triggered.  It could shoot off six
deafening blasts in a row.  It was loud for me and I had earplugs on.
Later they turned it on the audience at point blank range.

A walking robot, about the size of a pickup truck, had four
individually controlled feet.  It made a grand entrance as it spit a
stream of some fuel that smelled like turpentine.  A spark gap in
front ignited the stream and it could throw a flame 20 feet or so.
This started the pianos on fire.

Then the auger device made it's entrance.  It's also about the size of
a pickup truck, but on three wheels and with a roughly 12 foot long
finger in front.  The finger has four sections joined by universal
joints and is manipulated by pnuematically driven cables.  At the end
of this "finger" is a giant rotating drill bit.  It started attacking
all sorts of things and hovered over the audience for a while.

There's also this stationary fire machine.  It's an old truck engine,
driving a 4-foot diameter centrifugual blower that blasts fuel (also
smelling like turpentine) from two 55-gallon drums through maybe six
spark gaps out onto the stage.  This contraption created an
exceedingly hot explosive blaze of fire about the size of two houses.
'Almost burned my eyebrows off and I was in the third row.

The pianos were burning fiercely at this point.

We had to leave our position at this point because the fire machine
was leaking fuel, and that fuel was coming towards us.  So I went down
to the other end where the dinasaur was tearing the large cloth to
shreds and munching on the decaying meat.  Then it started munching on
the junkyard magnet robot, rupturing a fuel line, spewing gasoline all
over.  Okay, so I have to move again.  At this point the cornucopias
were ablaze.

After over an hour of this, the dinosaur got stuck in the remains of
the burning pianos and fell over.  They tried to get it out and put
out the fires but they were only partially sucessfull.  Four of the
air cannon tubes had melted limp.  The audience clapped politely.
Nobody was injured as far as I could tell -- I suffered only a small
piece of ash in my eye and weird dreams later that night.

Best comments overheard:

  "I'm sure glad I didn't drop that acid earlier this evening."
  "They're never gonna get those piano working again."

Here are some comments from Usenet.  There are some discrepancies
between my observations and theirs, but hey, that's the way these
things go.

I went to the Survival Research Show on Sunday night, under the I280 bridge
in San Francisco. It was quite interesting, although I really wanted to see
some of the machines tear into each other.

What we saw were various diesel powered, radio controled machines made to
look like monsters from your worst childhood drug nightmares. One had a
"jaw" on the end of a three jointed "arm", another had a giant screw-auger
on the end of a similar arm, another had six huge carbide cannons that were
LOUD (especially under the bridge), another had a BIG flame thrower (capable
of shooting house-sized flames about 30 feet, yet another was of the design
of one of those "tree grinders", which spat pulverized wood and garbage on the
audience.

The real thrill came when the giant flame blower set fire to a stack of eight
pianos. If you have ever been to a house fire, imagine this under a bridge in
the city of San Francisco. The machine with a jaw on it took several bites out
of a giant cournucopia (hanging by large cables from the underside of the
bridge) filled with rotting veggies and garbage. Then the giant screw-auger
thing  and the giant tree-grinder thing teamed up....the screw thing attacked
the giant cornucopia, and the rotting veggies fell into the tree-grinder,
which promptly shot pulverized rotting fruit and garbage onto the audience.
Before this, the tree-grinder had spit pulverized wood statues at the audience.
All this time the giant carbide cannon thing was assaulting the hearing of the
audience. The giant screw-auger thing rushed the audience several times, and
I was sure that at least one person was going to die horribly with a giant
screw in his/her head.

All during this time the stack of eight burning pianos kept of getting more
and more out of control....the flames were hot and big. At one point, two
of the "techies" with Survival Research tried to slow the fire with CO2
extinguishers....HAH!!! Like pissing on a forest fire! Burning embers filled
the air, and I personally saw one land on the head of one of the people in the
audience. Needless to say, many of the women attending the show had retired
to the back fence by this time in an effort to protect their "long-term
investment" in their hair, least their moussed-up "rooster do's" explode into
flames!

In the end, I don't think that anyone died (luckily) or was serioulsy injured.
However, in this day and age of litigous pursuit, I find it hard to imagine
that any individual or group would be so lax and careless with the safety of
the audience....in a way, it was very refreshing!!! :-)

The giant flame-blower thing could have bar-b-q'ed 100 people in less than
5 seconds, and I am not kidding or exaggerating one bit. The giant screw-auger
thing could have easily skewered several people, especially when it rushed the
audience. Remember, these things used radio remote control, the same
commercially available systems that RC airplane modelers use. God knows what
might have happened if some taxi cab operator had "keyed-up" near-by! At one
point, the giant flame-thrower thing seemed to be "attacking" on of the other
machines.....what if the diesel tank had exploded?

Does anyone know (just out of curiosity) if the Survival Research group had to
get the Fire Marshall's permission to do this show? Did they need to get
insurance in order for the city to grant them a permit? Based on what I saw,
I find it hard to believe the city was told the truth about what was going to
happen than night. Anyway, I havn't been to a good house fire in a while, so
this kind of "quenched my thirst".

Anyway, I survived....I was covered with ash and soot, and my right ear rang
for several hours (but the hearing in that ear has been damaged for about two
years, thanks to a Judy's concert). I feel better in a slight way, having seen
something like I imagine the future to be (a la the Road Warrior). Did anyone
else on the net see the show?

For nine bucks, it was worth it....but of course, if I had done it, it would
have been bigger, louder, more distructive, and generally more thrilling than
what I saw....now I have some ideas for my "Solstice to New Year's Party 1999
to 2000". If anyone wants to RSVP, contact me by e-mail. :-)

I was sitting right at the fire line where the 'auger' machine cranked
up.  It was very threatening, and when the firelineplasticthingy broke,
NOBODY crowded past.  Very civil of everyone.  Clearly indicative of
self-preservation instinct, althought there was no backing out through
the packed crowd.  "I SHOULD have brought my camera!", I thought a
hundered times - "How am I ever going to explain this".  I tied to
explain on the phone once this morning and eventually got the response
"You're not making this up, are you..."

Fortunately I missed getting showered with rotten fruit.  But there was
another flamethrower trying to ignite this stack of metal cans that
threw TREMENDOUS amounts of heat and flame, and the pump running it was
clearly overheating (we were waiting for it to explode.  At one point my
roommate commented "The pianos now appear to be officially out of
control" as the ash storm landed on the audience...

We didn't say it, but we all wondered what would have happened if some
wise-guy brought along their little airplane radio remote and made one
of these doomsday machines REALLY go bonkers...

No clues as to how these people got insurance/permits to do this.  And
what about the poeple driving on 280 (I thought it was 101...) above us?
How would you feel driving along and seeing smoke and ash belching from
beneath the roadway, and all that cannon noise?  Yow!

The things people will do in the bay area to get kicks on a Sunday Night!

&gt;some of the machines tear into each other.

The problem with this is that it makes the machines very difficult to
repair.  That is why Mark gives the machines a lot of other things to
destroy.

&gt;which promptly shot pulverized rotting fruit and garbage onto the audience.

You forgot the rotting fish.

&gt;Before this, the tree-grinder had spit pulverized wood statues at the audience.

Actually they were paper-mache pinatas which Mark found and painted
gold.

&gt;All this time the giant carbide cannon thing was assaulting the hearing of the
&gt;audience. The giant screw-auger thing rushed the audience several times, and
&gt;I was sure that at least one person was going to die horribly with a giant
&gt;screw in his/her head.

The only person who got hurt by the auger was someone working on the
show.  He had dust blow into his face and walked right into the auger.
He thought that it was a stupid injury too, but that is what happens
when you work for weeks without little or no sleep.

&gt;In the end, I don't think that anyone died (luckily) or was serioulsy injured.
&gt;However, in this day and age of litigous pursuit, I find it hard to imagine
&gt;that any individual or group would be so lax and careless with the safety of
&gt;the audience....in a way, it was very refreshing!!! :-)

No one was injured in this show.  If you think that you were safe
because you paid to see this show, you are mistaken.  We were trying to
keep things safe, however, you are at risk at the shows.

&gt;Does anyone know (just out of curiosity) if the Survival Research group had to
&gt;get the Fire Marshall's permission to do this show? Did they need to get
&gt;insurance in order for the city to grant them a permit? Based on what I saw,
&gt;I find it hard to believe the city was told the truth about what was going to
&gt;happen than night. Anyway, I havn't been to a good house fire in a while, so
&gt;this kind of "quenched my thirst".

Mark has been running these shows in the city for quite some time, so
the fire marshal knew what was going to happen.  And, of course he got
ther fire marshall's premission to do the show.  The SFFD hates the
shows, but they still go on.

&gt;Anyway, I survived....I was covered with ash and soot, and my right ear rang
&gt;for several hours (but the hearing in that ear has been damaged for about two
&gt;years, thanks to a Judy's concert). I feel better in a slight way, having seen
&gt;something like I imagine the future to be (a la the Road Warrior). Did anyone
&gt;else on the net see the show?

Based on what you saw of the show I assume that you had pretty good
seats.  Did we get you with the food?  Having worked the show, I can say
that there were several moments when I thought that my life was in
danger.  Being cornered between the magnet, the shredder and a pillar
while my microphone cable was pinned under the shredder was a bit
intense.  The burning cornucopia falling in my general direction was
also a bit intense.

Actually the most dangerous machine was not operating.  If you were
astute, you noticed a new machine started up towards the end of the
show.  It was on the curtain side of the performace area.  It drifted
out toward the far side (non control board side) of the "stage" and then
appeared to do nothing.  This was the "Shock box" which was on the
poster for the show.  It is nothing but a big capacitor, which was
supposed to short on the pillar and set it on fire.  Mark is not afraid
of flame throwers, he give no warnings about them.  He did say that when
the Shock Box was moving that noone whould be within 30 feet of it.
When Mark is afraid of one of his machines, everyone should be afraid.

&gt;For nine bucks, it was worth it....but of course, if I had done it, it would
&gt;have been bigger, louder, more distructive, and generally more thrilling than
&gt;what I saw....now I have some ideas for my "Solstice to New Year's Party 1999
&gt;to 2000". If anyone wants to RSVP, contact me by e-mail. :-)

How much more destructive could you have it?  At the end of the show,
almost none of the machines were operational, and almost everything out
there was burnt.  Realize that all those people working on the show were
volunteers, and that there were at least 20 or so people working every
time I was down at the warehouse for the last month.  Also realize that
the site was not available until friday afternoon.  I think that it
would have been difficult logistically to make the show significantly
more destructive, that is, without killing all the innocents in the
audience :-) .

I just found out that after we left the site of the show (about 1:00 am)
the fire marshall came by.  The had closed the freeway due to the smoke.

Did anyone notice that the power went off on the sound system and I
think the lights at about the 45 minute point of the show?  That was the
shock box blowing the fuse.  I don't think the flame thrower could
explode, because based on the number of times Mark has used it I would
think that it would have exploded already.

One final note, this show went pretty well, but it was not under
control.  I was stunned by the number of people who kept wandering out
onto the "playing field" during the show.  It was not safe for me, and I
knew what all the machines could do, and what they were supposed to do.
After the show people were even worse, there were fuel leaks everywhere,
and the audience would not get out of the area.  The only thing that
would have made our attempts at crowd control a success would have been
a gun or a flame thrower or maybe a stun gun.  The audience was not
showing much caution after the show.

danger can be exhilarating!  i once nearly lost my leg on an amusement
park ride, because i had a cast on and couldn't bend at the knee. i had
to hang OUTSIDE of the seat by my arms to avoid this nasty cable from
severing my foot.

another time i took two small girls on a ride, one mine and one my
friends. as the ride started to reach its relative apogee, the little
sweethearts starting to fall out and of course panic ensued.  i held
tightly on to them, and then i felt as if i too would fall out, taking
them with me.  the ride did not end too soon.

these experiences both made free fall seem rather boring in both my
daughter's and my extimation.

having been also engulfed in flames under my car in my garage was fun.
i was in a fire proof overalls , but didn't know that in advance.
i got excited, but kicked into rational mode and put myself out. again
and again.  my car was totally crisp by the time i was done.  My
daughter watched this also, in total disbelief.

Also scary was when i got out of my car in my driveway, and a tornado
immediately uprooted the neighbor's tree and crushed my car with it.
Yes, the driver's compartment. Btw, this is covered by car, not
homeowner's, fyi.

but i digress. i just wanna know when the next show is, and how i can
get front row seats!!!

545 Tech Square
Cambridge, MA 02139

         Programmers and users picket Lotus, protesting
               user-interface copyright litigation

CAMBRIDGE, MA, May 24, 1989 -- Chanting anti-litigation slogans,
a group of almost 200 computer-science professors and students,
software developers, and users, under the League for Programming
Freedom banner, picketed Lotus Development Corporation
headquarters here today.

The demonstration was called to protest lawsuits by Lotus, Apple,
and Ashton Tate, which "threaten to kill the growth of the
software industry by trying to create a new kind of legal
monopoly: copyright on the 'look and feel' of user interfaces,"
said protest organizer Richard Stallman, a legendary computer
hacker and developer of EMACS, a widely used and imitated
programming editor.

Marching from MIT to Lotus, the group chanted, "Put your lawyers
in their place; no one owns the interface;" "Hey, hey, ho, ho,
software tyranny has got to go;" and "1-2-3-4, toss the lawyers
out the door; 5-6-7-8, innovate don't litigate; 9-A-B-C, 1-2-3 is
not for me; D-E-F-O, look and feel have got to go"--the first
hexadecimal protest chant--and carried protest signs: "Don't make
me wear your suit!" (showing a person in a straightjacket), "Drop
the suit, we've got you surrounded," "Creative companies don't
need to sue," and "Oh no! Look and feel copyright!" accompanied
by a reproduction of the painting, "The Scream," by Muench).

The group also distributed leaflets to Lotus employees and
others, urging them to boycott products from Lotus, Apple, and
Ashton Tate and refuse to work for these companies.

The demonstration was backed by three prominent MIT computer
scientists: AI Lab founder Marvin Minsky, AI Lab head Patrick
Winston, and professor of electrical engineering Gerald J.
Sussman; Stallman, and Guy Steele, author of the book "Common
Lisp," the standard for the Lisp language, and co-author of "C, A
Reference Manual." Also present at the demonstration was Bryan
Kocher, President of the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM), a professional organization of computer scientists and
programmers.

The protests were directed against Lotus, which has sued
Paperback Software and Mosiac; Apple Computer, which has sued
Microsoft and Hewlett Packard; and Ashton Tate, which has sued
Fox Software and is extending its claims to a computer
programming language, Dbase.  According to Stallman, "If these
companies are permitted to make law through the courts, the
precedent will hobble the software industry.  Software will
become more expensive.  Users will be `locked in' to proprietary
interfaces for which there is no real competition, or be
encumbered with incompatible new interfaces."

Stallman said the League for Programming Freedom is developing a
national organization and is looking for volunteer officers.  It
also plans future protests and lobbying efforts.  For further
information, write: Richard Stallman, League for Programming
Freedom, 545 Tech Sq, Cambridge, MA 02139.

&gt;&gt;At KSC..
&gt;&gt;Three main engines were installed into the Space Shuttle Columbia
&gt;&gt;today, with testing scheduled to take place latter this week.  The
&gt;&gt;Orbiter's commode was reinstalled today with functional testing due
&gt;&gt;to be completed next week.  The Orbiter will remain in the OPF
&gt;&gt;until late June, when it will be moved to the VAB to be mated with
&gt;&gt;its external tank, and solid rocket boosters.

Functional testing.  One of the great unwritten stories of my free-lance
writing career was about the astronaut's toilet strike.  A neighbor who's
in the space program told me about it.  There was this enormously
foul-mouthed, bad-tempered engineer responsbile for the toilets on the
lunar lander.  He so annoyed everyone else -- all nice, neat people -- that
the contractor fired him.  As soon as the astronauts heard about it, they
threatened to strike because they refused to use anyone else's toilets but
his.  He was reinstated and the flow was restored.  I asked my neighbor to
ask this guy if I could do the story -- interview him and try to get some
astronaut to say something about it -- but it was getting harder and harder
to stay in the space program and he just didn't want to attract any
attention.  Too bad.  Hey, fellow, if you're reading this, the offer is
still open.
