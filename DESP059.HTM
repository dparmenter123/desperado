I've been at DEC nine years, so leaving is a major life event.
Small company fever has claimed another victim. I'm excited
about my new job, very excited, but I will miss DEC in some
ways.

DEC is much bigger and very different from the company I joined
nine years ago. 32V alone is bigger than the company I'm going to.

Nine years ago, I was excited about DEC because I wouldn't have
to use cards anymore. Interactive computing was still a new
concept then. Software wasn't exactly a household word then
either. When I told my family I was joining DEC as an Associate
Software Engineer, they thought I was going into plastics or
clothing or dry goods or something. Now everybody is
into software. Ten year old kids are making more money at
it than I am!

My first office was on 12-2. I had no furniture. In fact by
the time my furniture came, I had been moved to Marlboro.
We didn't have terminals in our offices then. There were
terminal rooms scattered around the mill. I spend much
of my first six months in the terminal room on 3-5.
Marlboro was slightly better, we still didn't have terminals
in our offices, but we didn't have to hike down five flights
of stairs to retrieve listings or mount DEctapes. Being
the lowly, new kid on the block I got a window office. Window
offices were most definitely not status symbols--they were
two square feet smaller than regular offices and were such an
integral part of the heating and airconditioning system that
we froze in summer and sweltered in winter, except for the
winter weekends during the energy crisis when they shut off
the heat. Then we froze in winter too. One of my fondest memories
of Marlboro is of the BASIC-20 project all working on Christmas
Eve, sitting at our VT05s (by that time we all had
terminals) wearing gloves, hats, coats and scarves
and still freezing.

I moved back to the mill to work on FORTRAN. Since the languages
people only owned 1 machine (system 5080 running IAS), we had
to compete with the RT, RSTS, and RSX people for standalone machines.
I usually lost and ended up with time from midnite to 8 a.m. or
something. I think I spent more nights in the 5-5 machine room
than anyplace I've ever lived.

The day we packed up to move to Tewksbury, we unrolled a DECtape
(an old FORTRAN distribution kit) from 5-5 into the pond.

I've worked in Maynard, Marlboro, Tewksbury and Spit Brook as
a software engineer, as a writer, and as supervisor. I've
used/worked on TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSX-11M, RSX-11D, IAS, RT-11,
RSTS and VMS.

I'll miss the people I've worked with. I'll miss the convenience
of the engineering network. DEC has been a learning experience. Now
it's time to move on and use some of that experience.
