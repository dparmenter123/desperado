                    CARING FOR YOUR THREE-YEAR OLD

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Today is the third anniversary of the Desperado mailings.  I received
my first piece of mail from a distribution list on July 28, 1980 -
something about a meeting, probably - and sent out my first mass
mailing, to all the RSX writers, the next day.  I won't say it came to
me in a flash and I saw all Desperado would become in an instant, but
I had a pretty good idea I could have some fun with it.

The first two mailings went to WRITERS.DAT.  Then, Jonathan Ostrowsky
asked if he could be on the list, the first to ask.  I said yes, but
since he was obviously no writer, I asked him what he was.  "Me?  A
desperado, I guess."  I put him on the list and renamed it
DESPERADO.DAT.  I found out the default file type the next week,

At any rate, as they form a set, here are the first three mass
mailings.

Subject: VEGGIE DOGGIES

My macrobiotic neighbors, as it turns out, bought some of the vegetarian dog
food for their one-eyed dog, Oscar, but Oscar wouldn't eat it until they mixed
some meat in it.

They didn't buy any more.  Oscar is as healthy as any of them.

                  The Way It Is -- And Why
                      by Lee Whipple

          (National Review, July 8, 1983, Pg 823)

I'm going to settle this once and for all.  Oh, I know you don't think
so.  But just watch.

The question is, Why is the world run so incompetently?  From the guy
who picks up your trash to the men in charge of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, is the world run by intelligent men who are putting us on,
or by idiots who really mean it?

Why, as Murphy postulates, does everything that can go wrong--go
wrong?  Why do "the best-laid schemes o' mice and men Gang aft
a-gley"?  Why does it take 17 electricians to screw in a light bulb?
Why don't the trains run on time?

Whan can't you get good help any more?

All right.  I'll tell you why.  You're not going to like it.  But
here's why.

The world is average.

Most people, most times, in most places, are average.  C.  That's the
kind of work most people do.  That's the way it is.  You never could
get good help.  And you probably never will.

The problem is one of expectations:  You think you should be able to
get above average products, services, and performances from others on
a regular basis.  Statistically impossible!  An illusion!  But easy to
understand.

Take antique furniture.  This is furniture from the past, not just
old, but prized for its design and the craftsmanship that went into
making it.  Antiques are valuable.  They are well cared for and become
the source of our notion of what furniture was like in the past:
"They really made things back then."  As for today:  "They just don't
make 'em like they used to."

Baloney!  Most of the junk was left behind, filtered out.  The
reference system for furniture is skewed toward the excellent.  Our
perception of average design and workmanship is based on an illusion,
which leads to the expectation of above-average furniture on a regular
basis--and heightened dissatisfaction when we don't get it.

Apply the antique-furniture phenomenon elsewhere, anywhere.

If someone opened a restaurant in 1950 with mediocre food and ordinary
service and it went broke, would anyone remember?  But if it was
excellent, it was brought forward in memory, along with other fine
restaurants, to form the perceptual base from which we derive our
present notions of average--and our heightened expectations.

And on and on, and it has always been like that.

Even in the present, what products of human endeavor do we prominently
display?  Right, the best ones; which further distorts our notion of
what average is--and ipso facto (ipse dixit) our expectations.

True, dramatic debacles get through the historical filter.  And
fiascos of the present are present in the news.  But look at the
numbers--excellent v. incompetent--on prominent display over the
entire landscape.  The incompetent is merely a spice we put on the
excellent to enhance our indignation about the average.  From the guy
who picks up our trash to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and on
and on.

The expectation that the products of human endeavor will be
consistently above average is what leads to the gnashing of teeth; and
all the laws, axioms, postulates, corollaries, comments, rules,
principles, philosophies, dilemmas, extensions, mottoes, and maxims
that attempt to explain why the world doesn't work as it should--and
bemoan the fact that it doesn't.  All grand attempts at wishing away
the bell-shaped curve.

The world is average.

There, now you understand.

Feel better?

Neither do I.

I wouldn't call it chickening out that we never ended up with a
HANOI to go with BABEL, EIFFEL, and PISA.  HANOI has simply lost
every time in a popular election.  After all, it took three
elections for my own suggestion, IVORY, to win over the majority.
And our latest addition is LEGO...can HANOI be far behind now?

Subject: scientology/salvation

In Boston this weekend I encountered two people (scientologists--disciples of
L. RON HUBBARD) who wanted to save my mind/soul/psyche/self.  I asked them why
I should be picked for "salvation" as apposed to that ten-year-old
"oriential-looking" girl in braids standing on the corner-- why did they pick
me?

Response: I looked like I needed help -- in fact, I looked "decadent!" With the
help of SCIENTOLOGY, I could look forward to a profitable career in ---
the COMPUTER field!  SCIENTOLOGY would bring those bits and bytes in my brain
into focus... The cost?  Only $2500.00 for a three week "specialist" course
(pay your own living expenses)!

Well, BEDFORD, et tu?  What price salvation?

Subject: we don't cotton to long names in the Peach State

If electrical engineering is designing and building electrical things,
and software engineering is designing and building software things,
then human engineering is ...

This comes from "Computerworld" which has been known to report some
things accurately.

"As of July 1, designers of corporate names will have to take into
consideration the needs of the state computer system when filing papers
for incorporation, partnerships or associations.  The state General Assembly
recently passed legislation limiting the length of corporate names to 80
characters, including spaces and punctuation.

"The State Corporation Division in the past has encountered numerous cases
of corporate names stretching from 80 to 150 characters.  But since CRT
display screens typically have 80 char./line and the software program allows
only one line for the company name, the limit was requested 'to adapt better
to our computer system,' according to Georgia's Secretary of State
Max Cleland."

Subject: new DEC processors, the "official word"......

From the June 1983 issue of the PAGESWAPPER (the DECUS VAX SIG newsletter):

The official word on larger VAX processors at the St. Louis Symposium
came not at the VAX Sessions at all, but at the Large System opening
session.  A slew of DEC officials, including three vice presidents,
were present to tell 10/20 users that DEC has abandoned further work
on Jupiter, the project to build a faster 36-bit machine.

In this context, with 10/20 users expressing anguish over the lack of
a larger 36 bit machine in their future, DEC officials spoke of the
work which still continues and is planned for the future on larger VAX]
processors.

"We've got several projects in place right now" said Sam Fuller,
Manager of Research, "to develop a 32 bit machine that has on the
order of twice the performance of the 2060 that you're using today."

"Our new high-end multi-MIPS VAX product is proceeding extremely well,"
was the characterization from Vice President of Corporate Operations
Win Hindle.  He went on to say "It has been turned on and is running
in DEBUG mode today."

Looking further into the future, Sam Fuller said "DEC's committed to
coming up with a machine that will have a price below a 2060, yet will
have the power beyond a Cray-1 in the 1991-1992 time frame."
