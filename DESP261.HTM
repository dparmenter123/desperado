 So, I blew it bigtime on Hiroshima with a careless remark backed by
 a notable lack of walking across the room to check the day's paper
 or any other research.  First, the temperate observations of the
 readers, then my finale.

#6 of your resurrected publication cites Strategic Bombing Survey as
having concluded that "smashing Dresden and Hiroshima had little
strategic effect and in fact made our enemies determined to fight
harder".  While there's a lot to be said for this general line of
reasoning, your choice of examples may have been unfortunate.

The general criteria for evaluating a military strategy are (or ought
to be) that it should help one's own side win as quickly as possible,
while minimizing casualties to one's own forces and to non-combatants.
And I think that it's been pretty well established that in almost all
cases, strategic bombing does very poorly in such an evaluation.  As
for Hiroshima, one could make a case (and some people have) that Japan
would have surrendered pretty soon even if the bomb hadn't been
dropped, and therefore all it did was to cause a lot of needless death
and suffering.  But to suggest that it made the Japanese "determined
to fight harder" is a little hard to swallow, given that they
surrendered a week or so later.

&gt; Smithsonian exhibit was hostage to the cancellation of that A-bomb stamp
&gt; with the "Linchpin of Victory" slogan last month.

I never saw an assertion that the A-bomb was the linchpin of victory,
nor that the stamp carried such a slogan.  At the time of the A-bombs,
everyone knew which side was going to be victorious, but there were
disagreements over how many lives should be wasted in trailing down
to it.  The military said they wanted to waste 100,000,000 Japanese
civilians, they waited for the bombing of Nagasaki because they weren't
convinced by a demonstration that they saw before Nagasaki, and they
even tried to sabotage the surrender when they deadlocked with the
government after Nagasaki and the emperor was allowed to step in for
the first time and break the deadlock (in favor of surrender).  Actually
there were only about 80,000,000 Japanese at the time, so the A-bombs
permitted 79,600,000 of them to live as the military got chucked out.

   The Smithsonian isn't saying anything about bombing Japan that the
   Strategic Bombing Survey didn't say in 1946.  No doubt there's some
   PC weaseling in the exhibit, but the conclusion of the survey was
   that smashing Dresden and Hiroshima had little strategic effect and
   in fact made our enemies determined to fight harder.  I guess the
   Smithsonian exhibit was hostage to the cancellation of that A-bomb stamp
   with the "Linchpin of Victory" slogan last month.

There was an article in Technology Review a few years back that had
pages of Truman's diaries.  I forget the exact text, but the gist was
that Truman knew Japan was beaten (the Japanese government had already
been making peace overtures) and he was already thinking about the
postwar order.  The bombs were dropped to demonstrate American power
to the Russians.

It doesn't surprise me that you probably got a huge number of
responses to that Hiroshima/Dresden comment.  I got into that
argument with someone recently, but neither of us really knew
enough about it, so we decided not to pursue it (this has
been my argument strategy of late - I think that the Net's
main use for me will be argument-building).  I hope you
compile the results intelligently and show
both sides.  This would be a beautiful demonstration of
why moderated mailing lists are The Way To Go.  Rather
than a flamewar, we'll get a discussion.

On a similar note, News of the Weird postings and the like
seem to amuse me very little.  Ever since I read
Jan Howard Brunvand's books I've become very suspicious
of this sort of thing.  The absence of attribution, sources,
etc. should be construed as "poor journalism" (as defined
by me, not a journalist).  Also, the net is chock full of
this sort of thing.

It's your baby of course, but as a reader I like to think that
Desp is a bit more rarefied than your usual net chatter.
We Parmenters are always outsiders among the outsiders,
and insiders among the insiders.  How pompous, right?  But
accurate.  It amazes me how often I end up "eating crow"
(and none of this "corvophagia", ya wanna sound like a
geek?) due to running off at the mouth.  It's a great way
to learn.

Keep up the good work.

 Thus, my embarrassment is complete.  I cop to all and add that
 there was much about the exhibit that was shallow and
 ill-considered.  But not as shallow and unconsidered as my
 venturing into this without thought.  Sorry.  I will go study up on
 it and report back later.

I don't know if you intended to take a poll on this, but I understood
that smilies evolved as self-delimiting constructs of a parenthesized
nature, so a 2nd closing paren would be redundant: "(it's a joke, y'know? :-)"

From: Uucp@aol.com
Subject: My life as "uucp@aol.com"

America Online allows its user accounts to specify up to five "screen names",
which uniquely identify the user.  AOL screen names consist of a capital letter
followed by two to nine alphanumerics or spaces.  The screen name is not
case-sensitive, so "MR SMITH" and "Mr Smith" refer to the same account, and the
AOL software forces uniqueness on new names by appending digits to the end of
the name.

AOL accounts can also send and receive Internet e-mail.  AOL converts its
screen names to Internet-style addresses by dropping all spaces and appending
"@aol.com", so our "Mr Smith" becomes "mrsmith@aol.com" to the outside world.

Which is where I come in.  I was trying to come up with a unique screen name
that did not end in randomly assigned digits -- AOL's membership stands at 1.5
million users, each of whom can reserve up to five names, so most common
English words and names are already taken.

Idly searching for a name, I requested "root".  (I always put this down as my
first choice when requesting a new account.  It never hurts to ask.)

The AOL software politely informed me that this name was taken, and said the
same when I requested "postmaster", "webmaster", etc.  In some cases it
suggested an alternative like "webmast236", and in others it simply said "That
name is taken."

Then I requested "uucp".

And the software asked me to enter my new password.

    *

Since then I've been getting a lot of strange e-mail, to put it mildly. Much of
it is private correspondence from external addresses to accounts on AOL, or
vice versa, that has been Cc:'d to uucp.  (I don't know why. Is this happening
due to user ignorance or carelessness, or is it the behavior of the mail
software?)  In no case so far has the sender suspected that "uucp@aol.com" is a
live human being.

The RISK here is the assumption that "uucp" (or, for that matter, "root") is a
trusted e-mail address on the remote machine.  The only required e-mail address
in RFC 822 is "postmaster" -- there is no requirement that the remote machine
use the UUCP transport mechanism, the UNIX operating system, or that any e-mail
address other than "postmaster" route e-mail to the system administrator.
("Postmaster@aol.com" does route e-mail to a person responsible for AOL's mail
system, in compliance with RFC 822.)

AOL reserves certain screen names to prevent this kind of confusion, but "uucp"
was not one of the reserved names.  (Neither was "nuucp", if you were curious
-- I've reserved that one too.  I think I can retire both addresses permanently
by deleting the screen names from my account, but I plan to make certain before
doing so.)  "Root@aol.com" and "webmaster" are already in use, but I can't say
*who* is using them.

Of course these RISKs apply to any site, not just to AOL -- any site could have
a user account named "uucp" and still be RFC 822 compliant. But as the net
grows, and incorporates more and more diverse machines, the RISK becomes more
dangerous.  Don't assume that mail addressed to "uucp" or "root" on a remote
machine is going to a trusted recipient, because for at least one large site
this assumption isn't true.

 There should be quite a flutter of Desperadoes this weekend.  This is
 the first Desperado ever mailed from inside Emacs.

 The "universal solvent" quote I picked up from a speech by "an Apple
 fellow" in 1988.  It conformed to a long-held conviction of mine, so
 I polished it and adopted it, that is, appropriated it.  Putting it
 next to a probably bogus copyright claim is my twist.  And how about
 that butterfly?
