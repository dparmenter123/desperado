I recently received a book through my book club called "More
Joy of Lex" by Gyles Brandreth.  While leafing through it, I
came across a passage that brought to mind the discussions a
few  months  ago  about  the  proper  spelling  of "its" and
"it's".

The Oxford Rule:

It's is not, it isn't ain't, and it's it's, not its, if  you
mean  it  is.  If you don't, it's its.  Then too, it's hers.
It isn't her's.  It isn't  our's  either.   It's  ours,  and
likewise yours and theirs.

   Soviet Helicpoter violates West German air space

   MUNICH, West Germany (AP) - A Soviet military helicopter
violated West German air space Friday and flew about 1,000 yards
into Bavaria from East Germany, police said.
   Bavarian police said it was the ninth time this year that Soviet
military aircraft has violated airspace over the southern German
countryside.
   ``It was a Mi-24 Soviet military helicopter,'' said a police
spokesman who asked not to be named.
   He said the helicopter was only briefly over West German
territory before it returned to East Germany.
   According to police records three Soviet aircraft and six
helicopters have violated West German airspace in separate
incidents since the beginning of the year.

        I've just returned from 3 weeks in Japan and, forewarned by a previous
note in Desperado, had a lot of fun observing the way that English gets
tortured there, usually on T-shirts.  My favorite is a souvenir plaque that I
picked up at Kamikochi, a resort area at the entrance to the Japan Alps
National Park:

        "Kamikochi shows us a magnificient view of nature. The
        summit of mountains above the clouds has vigor keep a
        person off.  It's fascination let many people who seek
        for roman come near."

That's an exact transcription; doubters are invited to see it in my office.
The only way to make any sense out of it would be to translate back into
Japanese and perhaps see what the original idiom meant to say.  Any guesses?

Malapropisms are often apt if inappropriate.  Spoonerisms, malapropisms,
and Archie-Bunker-isms are those mangled phrases that often contain a
crazy, twisted logic all their own.  I want to share a few of these with
you.

One woman I know confided that her husband recently told her, in anger, to
"ship up or shape out".  But he quickly forgave, allowing that it was
easier to "Burn the hatchet at both ends."  He gets TV programs mixed up,
too.  Big Valley becomes Deep Canyon, Medical Center is Animal Shelter,
60 Minutes becomes 60/60 (he does like 20/20, too).

Another person once told of a spouse who has declared "Oh, well, it's 12
of one and a half-dozen of another"; refers to Greyhound bus lines as
Trailhound, and complains about a friends "Voltaire" (volatile) personality.
She also likes sending "Happy St. Valentine Time's Day" cards.

A man from Portal, Arizona, once wrote about a warning that he received
as a youth:  "A needle in the bush gathers no moss."  To which he added,
"Alas, I took no heed, and now having buttered my bread, must lie in it."

Former Army Major Robert R. Spooner (hence the name spoonerism) of
Colorado Springs once introduced himself at a military meeting with a
classic spoonerism all his own...."OK, this is Major Speaner spooking."
His inner ear must have liked it, for he repeated not a moment later.

A North Carolina woman wrote of a legal secretary who said it was like
"Pulling hens' teeth" to get her lawyer to file a brief at the court-
house.  And her own fumbled attempt at trying to put off an ardent suitor
ended up like this: "I'm sorry, just think of us as two ships that go
bump in the night..."

A Carson, California man offered the advice he got from an impatient
teacher on a geology field trip:  "You wouldn't be happy if they drove
a silver stake through your ear ball."

From Hyannis, Massachusetts, came these secretarial gems from an
employer, who adds, "bless her mental frame of mind."  Amazed at a
surprising occurence, she exclaimed, "You could have tickled me with a
feather."  And in cautioning the boss not to tease a fellow worker, she
advised: "It's best not to rib his leg."

An Andover, Massachusetts man remembered his father, who noted that one
of his relatives would be shocked by the goings-on today: "Why, if he
were alive, he'd turn over in his grave..."

One of the best bunches came from a man in Little Compton, Rhode Island.
For more than 40 years of married life he kept a books of his wife's
bloopers.  Here goes:

"You can't expect Bruce (their dog) to sit around all day cooling his
        thumbs..."

(and after the same dog messed on the carpet)

"After all, he's only human."

"I'd give my eye shirt.  He's got a bear by the horns.  I waited on
him hand and glove.  It never rains but it shines.  He shook like an
aspirin leaf. He reads every magazine from foot to cover.  He slammed
the door at the top of its lungs.  The papers were waylaid somewhere.
He's slight of hearing.  Don't carry a grudge on your shoulders.  He
roared like a bullfinch.  Before you can count 'Jack Robinson'.
Hasn't that hole in your trousers healed yet?  My granddaughter danced
around me like a ten foot pole.  I wouldn't buy that house if it was
given to me.  (At the bridge table)  That bid certainly took the steam
out of my sails."

ABOUT THAT MESSAGE FROM THE LITTLE BIRDIE ABOUT MISS DECEMBER

Hell, I went to school with her........that little vocational school
in Lexington which she mentions is none other than Minuteman Tech
(population 1200).  I wonder what would have happened to me if I had
majored (as, I believe, did she) in cosmetology instead of
Electronics.  Well, I suppose makeup can do wonders, but perhaps there
are some things one can't just "Make up"..........at least I have a
steady job here......... so I guess I can't complain.  Maybe I should
ask her for some pointers on "How To Succeed In Business Without
Really Trying" eh?

I'm interested in putting together a system for a blind friend of

writing and editing; she has access to a braille printer, and would
want to transfer files to the machine it is hooked up to.

I'd like to hear from anyone who has any ideas on this subject, knows
of hardware/software that would be useful, etc.  If possible, I'd
like to create a prototype on a random personal computer (I have a
robin, which is reasonably random), but I'd also like to know about
whatever's now out there and useful re: voice output devices,
word processing or editing packages that could be adapted to
blind people's use, and so on.

Subject: We change the way Digital works

Just had my first opportunity to try out TSN, the wonderful new
data network.  It has an input throughput of around 50-70 Baud
and an output throughput of around 300 Baud.  I.e, useless for
anyone who can type.  Also, there are these wierd 10 second
pauuses while it catches its breath.

It seems that using the Arlington FX line to dial in was too
popular and, rather than improve the FX service, it was
easier for the beaurocracy to forbid its usage.  TSN is
better (for someone) because its usage can be billed to
the cost center, rather than being spread around the corporation.

Ah yes, the new Digital.  Half the people are making it harder
to get anything done around here, and the other half are complaining
that the stock price has sunk.

Maybe that should be "We change the way the Digital thinks about
computers."

Ever wonder just how late you were for that staff meeting yesterday?
Well, the Heath Company has just introduced an under $300 digital
clock with zero accumulative error - that's right, zero accumulative
error - not far removed from the accuracy of the Bureau of Standards
Cesium Atomic Clock in Colorado. Actually, the Heath clock monitors
the WWV time signals, factors in propagational error, and displays the
correct time to the hundredth of a second. The F15 of digital clocks.
Rumor has it that those AM radio watches will soon be monitoring WWV
providing the most accurate wrist watch time in the world for under
a $100.

Subject: A schizoid disk drive???

Believe it or not, the RA series disk drives (60,80,81) evidently have some-
thing called a 'personality board', which defines its interaction with the
controller.  As a FS engineer remarked, 'How do I explain in technical terms
to a customer that his disk drive isn't working because it has a personality
problem?  Should I have him call a shrink?'.

I classify this as one of the great theoretical questions of recent history.

I really dislike the use of technical jargon in normal language, like
when people talk about "interfacing" to everything.  My feeling is that
there is probably a better term already in English, and that speaking in
jargon is often pretentious and obscure.

There's always an exception, right?  I was watching channel 5's Chronicle
on Halloween; the show was about magic.  Peter Mehegan was talking about
Egyptian soothsayers, saying that they "used the entrails of slaughtered
animals as their data base".  A bloody DBMS?

Subject: Real Time RSTS-11

RSTS has an honorable and ancient history as a real time system.
The first one I knew was developed by Outokumpu, the Finnish
State copper mine authority in 1972 or so (RSTS V3C).  (This
pre-dates both RSX-11D/M and the 11/45, by the way.)  They chose
RSTS because Dec didn't have any other real-time capability except
RSX-11[B,C] and that wasn't particularly useful.

The system ran the concentrators in a copper/nickel mine.  It
consisted of two computers linked with a 2400 Baud asynchronous
line.  One of the computers ran a hard-coded home-brew real-time
system that monitored temperatures and adjusted relays, motors, etc.

Every five minutes, the RSTS system would send a "what's happening"
message and the little system would reply with a status dump.
The RSTS system would then use a linear program to optimize the
process, sending back a "change value" message to adjust temperatures.

There was a second terminal line to the assay lab, who would enter
the optimizing parameters into the system.  And, of course, the
parts of the system that needed tuning tuning could be worked on
without disrupting the ongoing process control.

This ran on an 11/20 with 28K memory, 2 Dectapes, and a 2-platter
RF11 disk.   I still find it strange that we have come so far
in the past 12 years that our "small" systems have 10 times the
hardware but hardly more capability.

Outokumpu sold similar systems to both the United States and to
Russia (legally, with export permits).  These used 11/40's with
RK05's and pen plotters.  The operating system was RSTS V5C with
two home-made device drivers which I did for them.  One was for
an HP pen plotter and the other for a VT30 graphics display tube.

Outokumpu is an interesting company -- when the airplane hijacking
crisis hit in the early '70s, they took the metal detector they
had developed to prevent tools from getting into the crushing mills,
spread the legs a bit, painted them white and sold them all over
the world.  (They're the ones that looked like a big white egg.)
They are still in the market -- the brand name is Meteor.

During the four years I was in the Stockholm office, I visited them
well over twenty times.  If the visit was planned, they generally did
a small lunch in one of the conference rooms -- nothing elaborate,
but always fresh and always different.  Finally, I asked my host
whether they had a card file on me.  "No," he said, "they have
one on me so I never get the same meal twice."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
RSX 11-C preceded RSX-11B, which preceded RSX-11A.  I gave the History
of RSX talk at Decus.  Someone came up to me afterward and assured me
that there were still a number of RSX-11A systems in the world,
including one that was an integral part of the NASA satellite tracking
network.  Real leading-edge technology.

One reason (or perhaps a symptom of) why DEC is doing so lousy lately
is this excerpt from an article in a recent issue of High Technology
(in the Microcomputers section, "A Buying Guide for Christmas", starting
on page 29, excerpt from page 30, High Technology, December 1983).

"The micros using other CPUs have nearly been lost in the deluge.  Digital
Equipment got its start by building minicomputers that undercut IBM's
mainframes; now DEC is undercut by the micros.  DEC's corporate marketing
for micros is hampered by two obsolete designs, the DECmate II (a 12-bit
PDP-8) and the Professional 325 and 350 (16-bit PDP-11).  The huge PDP-11
software base was written in an earlier era when computers were run by
specialists.  That software can't compete today; at best those machines
serve narrow vertical markets..  All the confusion and a late start have
left DEC's 8088 based Rainbow 100 far behind the leaders.  DEC's powerful
new micro VAX mainly targets software developers and other specialized
applications."

I think the author is wrong on many points, but the major one is this:
DEC's corporate marketing is hampered by the fact that they can't sell
anything that doesn't sell itself.  And we have fewer and fewer things
these days that can sell themselves to the tune of $4 billion a year.

Robert Morris, an experimental psychologist at the Communications
Studies Laboratory at Syracuse University,...in 1982, studied how
people interacted with a computer and found that the computer crashed
more often for 13 people who didn't value what they were doing. For
another 20 people who had a more positive attitude, it didn't
malfunction as often. "The subject of anomalous human-equipment
interactions is becoming a potential social problem as we rush into
the computer age," he says. He proposes a research project that will
study such malfunction-linked people, or MLPs. "We also have FLPs, or
function-linked people," Morris continues. These are people who seem
anomalously linked with great success - like the repairman who can't
find anything wrong with your car, even though it stops working for
you as soon as you try to start it."

Somehow or other, your name has gotten added to the Desperado mailing
list.  Someone thinks you're crazy enough to enjoy it.

Desperado is an electronic rag that I send around the net from time to
time to several hundred Digital desperados from Australia to Sweden,
and even in Marlboro.  Everyone on the list is there by request.
(There are also lots of forwards, secondary and tertiary desperados,
but I don't know about them.)

The thing consists of whatever interests me on the day I send it out.
It's about half humor, half rumor, and half miscellaneous
clusterdness.  Most of it is mail I've gotten from other people.  Some
of it is mail from me.  Feel free to comment on anything, but if you
want the original sender to hear your views, you should send them mail
direct, in addition to whatever you send to me.  I may be bored with
the subject by the time I get your reply, but lots of discussions that
start in Desperado continue off line.

Everything in between strings of vertical bars (octal ASCII 174, | )
is written by me, along with the headlines, and all the pretty
decorations.

Desperado is designed to be scrolled a la' RSX, not paged a la' VMS.
If you get it on a VMS system, use the command FILE TT: to get the
best-looking Desperado.  That way, you also get to see the VT100
escape treatments that I thoughtlessly include from time to time.

Submissions from NEMO:: are anonymous.  Most are from people who don't
want their names published for whatever reason. Sometimes I decide
that your name should be left off for your own protection.  Some
NEMO:: submissions are from me.

I don't forward everything that is sent in.  I rarely forward the
heavily forwarded stuff unless it's too good to pass up.  Except for
submissions from NEMO::, everything else in Desperado comes
approximately as is from the person who sent it, although I usually
try to correct spellings and grammar. I often cut submissions down,
but I don't put words in your mouth.  I do save everything interesting
that comes my way, whether I forward it or not. Information on these
archives of network life is available on request.

I send one out when I can.  If you send me something with a date or
time in it, I may miss your deadline.  Too bad, huh?

Desperado is an underground benefit for DEC employes.  Don't forward
it outside, please.  It probably doesn't hurt to send a hard copy to
someone outside, but let's all be discreet.

It's usually not this boring.
