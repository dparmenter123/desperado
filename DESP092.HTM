Subject: Driving for desperados ...

I read the Desperado testimonial and had to write in reply to the
contributor claiming that U.K. drivers are similar to Bostonian/Mass. drivers.

That is a fallacious statement!

Having driven in many countries, and a few states, with a lot of time spent on
the roads and motorways of the U.K., I cannot accept the claim concerning the
driving in the quiet, peaceful town of Cambridge, U.K.

When I first came to Mass., I was amazed to hear people discussing driving
since there did not appear to be any. Slowly the realization dawned that they
refered to their "death wish activities" as driving - I had assumed that what I
had seen on the roads was merely a gross expression of the American
institutions of "stock car racing" or "demolition derbies".

I will admit that there are a few people living in Mass. who practise the dying
art of American driving, but the number is decreasing as they either get
killed, retire from the roads, or move to a better (safer and more tax free)
state. Of course, one can analyse Mass. driving quite simply: people from down
there are simply acting out the datagram services of an ethernet: sometimes you
get there, and sometimes you don't - but whatever you do, just get out into the
ether and rely on the other's brakes (i.e., ability to rebroadcast). The
American auto industry could save quite a bit by not providing mirrors on
cars to be used or sold in Mass. - the "drivers" don't use them anyway !

In the U.K. driving is different. For a start we drive on the RIGHT side of the
road - too bad the colonies made the change. Also we drive with more care and
attention for the other motorist. Even so, the speed limits in the U.K. are
higher than here so that traffic flows more quickly and smoothly. Driving
smaller cars, the Europeans are much more careful about traffic seperation and
the rules of the road - we don't have 5-mile-wide cars with 45-inch tires and
shock-absorbed bumpers to encourage the blind driving of Mass.

It is true that the U.K. driving test is more difficult to pass than an
American. First of all it takes up to 6 months to get an appointment, and
secondly, the test is suppose to prove that you can drive! If you get through
a U.K. test then you certainly can do all the basics, including backing up
around a corner while staying 12" from the curb at all times.

One thing they don't test in the U.K. though, parking. You don't have to be
able to park a car to get a licence to drive one. I guess they believe the
number of traffic fatalities caused by either parked cars, or cars being
parked, is not significant !

Personally I avoid driving or being driven in Mass. as much as possible, and
when I have seen Mass. registered cars up here in N.H., frequently try to work
out an alternative route to where I am going !

Robert.

Yes, we in Mass have terrible drivers.  The accident rate is among the
highest of the 50 states. The death rate per accident is, on the other
hand, among the lowest.  My theory is they rarely get going fast enough
to hurt anyone.  The Boston Driver's Handbook is very funny and very
true.  How to use a service station ramp to make a left turn when the
light is red.  I used to have the "Intimidator" front end on my car,
it was already bashed in, and everyone could tell I didn't give a care
if it got bashed again.

My greatest achievement as a Boston driver so far was cutting across
12 lanes of traffic coming in and out of the harbor tunnels on a
Friday afternoon with a copper standing 20 feet away directing traffic
and paying absolutely no attention to the fact that my car was
perpindicular to all the others he was waving along.

They used woodburning cars in Europe during WWII.  The cars had
charcoal generators mounted on them and burned the methane that the
wood gave off when being turned into charcoal.  They then used the
charcoal thus manufactured to operate the charcoal generators.  You
can't start a car on methane or kerosene or whatever, but if you can
get it started, it will run on lots of stuff.

a snake is a new england tradition, a tool to keep out the cold.
it is a cloth cylinder, about 3 cm in diameter and a bit longer than a door is
wide, filled with sand.  it sits on the floor, against the door, andd keeps
the cruel, cold drafts at bay.  there is a loop at one end so you can hang it
on a doorknob during the summer.

it is also useful for self defense or in retaliation for a "what is it?" gift.

        I actually read the label when I buy food.  Often, you can
learn a lot from the ingredients (which are, of course, written in the
smallest letters on the package) that you don't learn from the part
the *want* you to read.  For example, "all-natural" can mean "tons of
sugar".  Or, in the case of Diet Coke and Pepsi, "Now with Nutra-Sweet"
is a way of saying, "We still have saccharine - which will leave a bad
aftertaste and give you and your pet rats cancer".

        But I've never read a label that went quite like the
following:

        The product is Snapple (registered trademark) All Natural
Juice.  The flavor is "Passion Supreme".  The ingredients:

                Apple juice, white grape, red grape,
                pineapple, cherry, passion juices

The manager and the leprechaun  (translated by John Covert from the
                                original German, author unknown)

One night a manager was sitting in front of his Digicalc terminal
fussing with budgets when a leprechaun jumped onto the desk and
asked, "Are you not the great Digital manager?"

The manager was quite disturbed, could hardly pull his thoughts together
and his eyes away from the budget, but eventually realized the importance
of the situation and said, "Who, me?  You mean me?  Oh, yes, of course!"

Whereupon the leprechaun replied, "Gooood, great manager.  I have
come to grant you two wishes, which will be granted the instant you
answer.  Consider your response properly and thoughtfully, and then
reply."

The Manager wrestled with his thoughts for a while and then told the
leprechaun that he'd like to be on a remote island in the South Seas
with lots of topless girls which would serve him and provide all that
he needed, where there were no computers, no budgets, no Action Outages,
and where it is always summer.

ZZZaaapppp, he already was on the island, topless beauties handed him
fruits, drinks, and other goodies, he sat in a wicker chair under palms
overlooking the sea as the sun rose and a calm, warm wind flowed past
his tropical shirt.

Suddenly something moved in the sand at his feet.  It was the leprechaun
who said, "You still have one more wish, which you must ask for now!"

The manager was totally surprised, leaned back in his comfortable chair,
thought for a second, and said, "Never again in my life do I want to have
to do anything productive."

ZZZaaappp, zzzaaappp and he was already back in his office in front of his
terminal.

Now, of course, this sort of mistake can easily happen, but not at DEC,
right?

Subject: re: chain letter

Just before Christmas I cleaned up my directories and chucked all the
stuff about chain letters.

But in summary, it is against the law to send chain letters on the
arpanet. Such things waste an tremendous amount of disk space and clog
needed communication channels.

When the chain letters circulated around DEC in the fall, some people
sent them on to their friends out of DEC.  Due to some addressing
problems mine only got as far as RHEA and were noticed there.  Someone
else's letters made it out of DEC to Shasta.  People at Stanford
became justifiably upset, demanding official apologies.

DEC's access to the arpanet will be taken away if it is abused.  This
is no idle threat by Stanford.  It would be unfortunate to lose such
communications.  Please spread the word that chain letters should
never be sent from DEC to any arpanet address.  It's a pretty stupid
idea anyway.

asked that the equipment be returned to the United States and
foreign trade minister Mats Hellstrom has indicated Sweden is
prepared to do so.
   In late November Swedish customs seized four containers with 32
crates containing 30 tons of sophisticated U.S.-made computer
equipment after it arrived aboard a Swedish freighter from South
Africa via Hamburg. In Hamburg, West German port authorities
intercepted three containers with computer components but had
overlooked the others.
   West Germany has since shipped back to the United States the
equipment it seized.
   The owner of the equipment is Richard Mueller, a West German
businessman who is wanted by the West Greman authorities for
alleged smuggling of computers to the Soviet Bloc. Mueller and a
busines partner insist the equipment was for a Swedish civilian
comuter center.
   Swedish War Material Inspector Carl Frederik Algernon on
Wednesday classified the confiscated equipment as war materiel.
   In his report to the Swedish Customs Board, he said the
equipment includes an extremely advanced computer system from
Digital Electronics.
   ``The conclusion of the inspection is that the equipment is
specifically designed for military use and should therefore be
classified as war materiel,'' Algernon wrote.
  In an official statement on the report Hellstrom said, ``It is
important for Sweden as a neutral country not to be exploited as a
transit area for illegal traffic of strategic goods.''
   In a TV interview, Hellstrom indicated that Sweden is prepared
to return the computerware to the United States.
   ``The government does not want the war materiel in question
spread. The only destination for it I can see that we could license
would be if the original manufacturer (Digital Equipment Corp.)
would request re-exporting the material to them,'' the minister
stated.
