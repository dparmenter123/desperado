        I just saw an ad with the founder of Toys 'R' Us and it turns out
        his name is Lazarus.  Somehow I feel better about the name than I
        ever did before.

                                    =*=

        I'm overjoyed to have lived long enough to be able to add to my
        stock of mental images the one of J. Edgar Hoover in a frilly
        black dress, lace stockings, and a black wig, fully made up,
        prancing around the Plaza Hotel in 1958.  I *know* there are
        photographs out there, and maybe even home movies, and I intend to
        cling to life until I see the visual evidence of Hoover as drag
        queen.

        I always thought Hoover was no good, but the recent revelations of
        the depth of his corruption have been staggering.  He was
        completely in bed with the crime syndicate (both literally and
        figuratively).  Not only was the mob blackmailing Hoover with
        pictures of him and Clyde Tolson in a compromising position, they
        basically had him on the payroll. Hoover would place bets (with
        top mobster Frank Costello himself at one point), but if Hoover
        won he collected and if he lost he was never asked to pay.  In
        fact, Hoover never paid for anything, always on the cuff to
        businessmen or government, with FBI carpenters building him
        furniture, FBI artists repainting his rosy wallpaper and FBI
        chemists analyzing a round brown pile found on the Hoover patio
        (determined by the lab to have come from a racoon).

        For years, Hoover denied the existence of the mob and concentrated
        on the communist menace.  This menace attention is now clearly
        revealed as a smokescreen for not fighting the mob.  After all, if
        the entire social fabric is being eaten from within by evil
        atheists from Russia, what matter a few prostitutes, bookies, and
        dope dealers?  (By the way, I still am of the view that there
        *was* a communist menace, but clearly most of the folks who
        claimed to be fighting it never had a clue.)

        When Kennedy was elected, Hoover blackmailed him into accepting
        LBJ as his vice-president or he would reveal compromising pictures
        of JFK (More of the old tangled web.)  Nonetheless, JFK and Bobby
        went after the mob big time and forced the FBI to go along.  The
        mob was concerned that their bagman Hoover was losing his
        effectiveness and held a meeting to discuss what to do about it.
        Three weeks later, Kennedy was killed, as it is beginning to come
        clear, by a mob gunman.  Lee Harvey Oswald was there, so Lee
        thought, as a lookout, but actually as the fall guy.  (Listen
        closely to Oswald's remarks right after he was arrested.)

        This is all utter surmise, based on no evidence whatsoever, but I
        think we will be getting the answers on the JFK assassination in
        the next few years and it is not going to be pretty.  It'll be as
        ugly as J. Edgar "Call me Mary" Hoover in a dress.

        If he hadn't been in the closet he couldn't have been blackmailed.
        I am looking forward to this week's edition of "Outweek".

                                    =*=

        Other jokes:  Gay Edna Hoover (Howie Carr); America's top G-string
        man (JO); they can make a movie and call it "Johnny and Clyde" with
        Warren Beatty as Clyde and Peter Boyle as Johnny (JO); the reason
        J.Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson dressed alike was they were
        dressing out of the same closet (Jay Leno).

                                    =*=

        PC addendum:  Most transvestites are heterosexuals.  Most
        homosexuals are not transvestites.  The documentary on Hoover was
        not gay-bashing by any stretch of the imagination.

        UnPC Addendum:  The most convincing aspect of the revelation about
        J. Edgar Hoover's cross-dressing was that the woman (married to the
        mob's bisexual bagman) telling the story started giggling at the
        35-year-old memory before she could actually get started.

                                    =*=

        Gee, we were gonna have Bunny Kimba for attorney general and she
        didn't break any laws, but she's a goner nonetheless, thanks to the
        President's eagerness to please the beltwayariat.

                                    =*=

        On the other hand, beyond the beltway and outside the ideologues,
        Clinton seems to be making a hit.  One of the most telling
        criticisms I've seen is that he should have asked for more
        sacrifice since he got such a good response on what he did ask
        for.

                            WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        You know how cute baby animals are?  And how cute squirrels are? I
        had a baby squirrel in my house the other night and it was megacute!

        On the other hand, I don't really want wild animals in my house.
        My first thought was to let the cat have its way with the creature.
        I hired this cat to keep the vermin at bay and as far as I know,
        this is the first varmint to come her way.  The cat, Mlle. Jolie
        Blonde Kitty by name, thought this was a great idea too and ran
        back and forth after the creature.

        There were three problems with my theory:

                A - I didn't know whether Jolie had brains enough to
                    consume the corpse after capture.  She is disdainful
                    of the last tablespoonful of whatever expensive food we
                    buy for her.

                B - The baby squirrel was so cute with its big eyes and
                    its little body, teenager to the max.

                C - The cat was a complete flop as a squirrel hunter; the
                    thrill of the chase was everything for her; capture
                    never succeeded.

        So I cornered the squirrel and tossed a towel over it so I could
        carry it outside to freedom (and prosperity, I hope).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sometime ago I had some squirrels decide to nest in my soffit. A friend
    inquired how my weekend had gone and I replied with the following true
    story. (My apologies if I posted this earlier...)

    Mind you, I *like* the squirrels, woodchucks, raccoons, skunks, etc.
    that inhabit the woods behind my house. (I only hate ANTS!!!) Watching
    them gives me a lot of pleasure.

    Edd

...waiting for my coffee to heat Sunday morning, I hear *something* near
the window over the sink. Not in the house, not outside, but somewhere in
between. I slam a cupboard door and hear something scurry. A quick look
out the window shows the shadow of a squirrel standing on the roof.

Later that day, I once again hear noises. That's it, as much as I like
watching the little creatures frolicing in the trees, I'd really prefer
not to share my house with them. So, out I go...

Sure enough, there's a hole in the roof overhang big enough to let a
squirrel in. I grab a rake and bang the house. A raucous screech eminates
from the hole. Another bang. Another screech. Bang. Screech. Bang.
Screech. But no squirrel. Little sucker refused to leave.

So how do I get him out? Ha, I get a long piece of pipe from the cellar,
stick one end in the hole, and light up a smoke. Exhaling into the pipe, I
figure this will roust the beast. Three cigarettes later I've accomplished
nothing more than developing a nasty cough, and the squirrel remains.

Plan B. Get a long plumber's snake from the cellar and stick it in the
hole. Nice idea! Unfortunately it's too flexible to allow me to get it in,
so I have to get a ladder. From my lofty vantage I can get the snake into
the squirrel's lair. As soon as the device is thru the door the panic
starts. My house guest starts screaming and (apparently, for I can't see
in the hole) running around. After a good 1/2 hour of this aggravation, I
remove the snake. Senor squirrel, obviously no fool, uses this opportunity
to escape. He bolts out the hole, and runs headlong into manthing. Neither
one of us had quite taken this contingency into account, so the surprise
was mutual. Manthing dives from the ladder while the squirrel tumbles to
the ground.

The furry rodent, obviously displeased, first chases me across the yard,
then heads back towards the house with me in pursuit. Finally cornering
the beast, I now wonder just what the heck to do. My question is answered
promptly as the squirrel activates little rockets in it's feet and climbs
straight up the  outside of the chimney and goes BACK IN THE HOLE!!!

Great...

...so back up the ladder goes manthing with the snake. Back in the hole,
and the scene repeats. Finally the rodent emerges for a second time, but
rather than going down, it runs to the top of the chimney. Realizing this
is no ordinary squirrel, I pull out all the stops and grab the garden
hose. Taking carefull aim, I blast the beast with a powerfull jet of
water, knocking him off the chimney to the roof, where a second blast
convinces him to leap to the ground. Running on pure adrenalin, I continue
to blast the sucker during the freefall which spins him around. When he
finally reaches earth he's lost all sense of direction and runs straight
at me. I defend myself with the hose while the squirrel starts making
giant leaps into the air in a vain attempt to escape the watery onslaught.
Finally realizing the error of his ways, he runs up a tree and proceeds to
scold me for my deeds. Sorry Mr. Squirrel.

Tired and wet, I grab a small board and a hammer and nails and proceed
back up the ladder to close the hole. One bang of the hammer and
SCREEECH!!! Why, it seems Mr. Squirrel was trysting in my soffit! Argh,
there's a second one!

...another 20 minutes with the plumber's snake convinces the second one to
evacuate, only when this one hits the ground it doesn't head for the
woods. Au contraire! This one heads up the ladder I'm standing on! Visions
of a rabid, frothing_at_the_mouth, insane Cujo cum Rocky racing thru my
head, I fly up the ladder to the roof. My attacker stops 2 rungs from the
top and screams at me. The little creep has *me* cornered! I cautiously
approach the ladder and try to shake the rodent off. Ha. Fat chance. So I
flip the ladder over. Nice. My furry assasin falls to the ground and runs
around the side of the house.

Once down from the roof, I grab the house and run to the side. I take aim
and let go with a volley. Direct hit!! The beast spins and tumbles in the
stream of water. Wait! He recovers and takes off like a bat outta hell,
RIGHT INTO  THE CELLAR.

I enter just in time to see him take cover under a water tank. Not wanting
to get too close to this gray devil, I push the tank with my foot. Screams
ensue. Another push. More screams. At this point I'm wondering just what
I'm going to do when he finally realizes this is not a good place to be.
How am I gonna get him out. Alas, my concern was moot as it seems the
weight of the moving tank was more than the little guy could bear. Moving
the tank, I see my enemy mortally wounded, gasping for air. Now I feel
like a murderer. Removing his broken body from the house, I feel pretty
sad. No way this little squirrel is going to live, so I take him to the
edge of the forest, stroke him like a pet cat for a minute, and end his
misery. To add to my guilt, the first squirrel, apparently a her, not a
him, is screaming at me from the tree as I do the deed...

My joy at ridding the house of the animals somewhat diminished, I head
back  up the ladder to finally close in what once was a happy squirrel
home. One bang of the hammer and, you guessed it, ANOTHER one! This one
also resists  exiting so I poke around in the hole and start ripping the
nest out piece  by piece. Finally realizing the I'm serious about the
eviction proceedings the third beast makes a mighty jump to the ground.
Experienced by now, I leap from the ladder and grab the hose. Within a
couple minutes I've convinced this one to head for the woods, and a soggy,
decidedly un-bushy tailed  squirrel runs for his life.

Further poking reveals no more so I seal up the hole while two very angry
squirrels sit in a tree and prosecute me for my crimes. At 9:00 last night
they were still presenting their case. I fully expect to be convicted...

RE: Your prairie dog is a marmot ...  Issue 3069:

YOUR prairie dog may be a marmot.  If so, you should take it, quickly, to the
nearest mammalian taxonomist in your area.  Said individual will be thrilled
nigh unto death, as newly discovered mammal species occur but rarely on this
continent.

Marmots are members of the squirrel family, Sciuridae, within the order of
rodents (Rodentia).  Our continent is blessed with six species, all of the
genus Marmota, these being the woodchuck (M. monax), the yellow-bellied marmot
(M. flaviventris, named for its pelage, not its lack of character), the Alaska
marmot (M. broweri), the hoary marmot (M. caligata), the Olympic marmot (M.
olympus and the Vancouver marmot (M. vancouverensis).  Note the lack of a
prairie dog.

Prairie dogs are also members of the squirrel family, and we have four species,
all of the genus Cynomys, these being the black-tailed prairie dog (C.
ludovicianus), the white-tailed prairie dog (C. leucurus), the Utah prairie dog
(C. parvidens - all prairie dogs are polygamous, so we cannot blame Utah), and
Gunnison's prairie dog (C. gunnisoni).

It would be correct to call the prairie dog a sciurid, but it shares this honor
with some 20 species of chipmunk, nearly as many ground squirrels, a half-dozen
or so tree squirrels and two flying squirrels as well as the aforementioned and
maligned marmots.  While it is true the prairie dogs share with marmots a
tendency to bring out the worst in homeowners and golf course managers, they
share this honor with any number of other burrowing creatures, notably
including the pocket gophers, which are not sciurids but geomyids, being in the
family of (science is so wonderfully orderly) pocket gophers.

As a final note, since prairie dogs underweigh marmots by somewhere between 1:5
and 1:10, there is no guarantee that the device which vaccuums them from their
holes will have any effect on the far more robust, not to mention fat, marmots.

        Yes, thank you, John.

        My dictionary (W9NCD) still says the prairie dog is a colonial
        American burrowing rodent (genus Cynomys, esp. C. ludovicianus
        of the praries) related to the marmots.  And the big
        Not-really-Webster's says they're related to the squirrel and the
        marmot, but that they are frequently called the prairie marmot.
        So my ignorance is well-founded.

 I would bet that the US Fish and Wildlife Service would have a slightly
different interpretation of the right to bait protected species when it
results in harm to said species. Quite a few folks in Maryland have been
put in the slammer or had to pay substantive fines for baiting ducks and
geese -- caught in USFWS "sting" operations.

On a related note -- Barry and I went up to see the Hawk Owl in North
Springfield, Vermont in January, 1991. When we got there the bird was
sitting right up at the top of a spruce tree -- just like the photos. We
walked fairly close, and spent a long time observing and enjoying the bird
through a scope. I then decided to take some photos, and made a few
mouse squeaks to get the bird to look at me. He did -- hard! Then Barry
had what he thought was the bright idea of attracting the owl's attention even
more by squeaking and tossing/skittering  our car keys (in a small brown
leather case) across the snow. The owl was about 100 feet away.  The keys
bounce across the icy snow surface. The owl looks, looks hard, leans forward
and !suddenly! is down off his perch heading hell bent for election towards
our only car keys!  Barry says, "Blimey -- he's going to take the car keys!"
and struggles through the two-foot deep snow (with a nice hard crust) in
the same direction! The bird is 50 feet away, closing fast -- Barry is 15
feet away and doing a good job of slow motion running. I am helping by
laughing. When Barry gets about 8 feet away (and the owl is maybe 20 feet
from the keys, talons outstretched for the "mouse"), said owl realizes that
a large biped creature is about to steal his legitimate prey! No way! He
turns in mid-air, calls keee-kee-kee-kee!, and heads right for Barry's head!
Barry flings himself backward (with some sort of unique Anglo-Saxon noise),
owls passes through the space where his head had been, and lands about 15
feet away in a low tree. Barry recovers, grabs the keys. Bird rearranges
feathers, glares at us, panting, then (with a contemptious air) flies
back up to the spruce tip and resumes his vigil. I am still laughing. I have
also forgotten to take a single photo! We are pretty amazed at the owl's
reaction until a local arrives, and says that loads of photographers had
been there and tossed out mice for the bird. As a consequence he had gotten
fearless (if Hawk Owls are ever fearful), and had even flown into a car to
try and catch a mouse in a cage on the front seat.

So while it is a funny story from our point of view, for the owl it might not
have been such a good thing.  Wariness of humans is a good survival trait in
wildlife. But I gather that this particular bird, at least, survived birders,
photographers and cars and eventually slipped north one day.

"In Darwin, MN, sits the world's largest twine ball. It weighs
21,140 pounds, is twelve feet in circumference [sic], and was the
creation of Francis A. Johnson. After Johnson's death, the city
moved the ball and the silo that sheltered it into a special
city lot across from the park. Unfortunately, it has put a big
Plexiglas shield over the entranceway, making photos and true
communion difficult.

"Frank Stoeber of Cawker City, KS, saw Johnson's twine ball as a
challenge. He started amassing his own ball, and soon had over
1,600,000 feet of twine rolled into a sphere eleven feet in
circumference [sic] --only a foot shy of the Darwin champion.
Success seemed inevitable. Then, Frank Stoeber died. Cawker City,
in a touching tribute, built an open-air gazebo over his ball
and set it up on Main Street, where it can still be smelled and
admired by travelers."

Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service wrapup

By JOE ABERNATHY
Copyright 1993, Houston Chronicle

 AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret
 Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal
 District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a
 proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,
 and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment.

 The judge's formal findings in the complex case, which will
 likely set new legal precedents, won't be returned until
 later.

 A packed courtroom sat on the edge of the seat Thursday morning
 as Sparks subjected the Secret Service agent in charge of the
 investigation to a grueling dressing-down.

 The judge's rebuke apparently convinced the Department of
 Justice to close its defense after calling only that one of the
 several government witnesses on hand.

 Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was
 in charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March
 1, 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's
 rebuke over the Service's poor investigation and abusive
 computer seizure policies. While the Service has seized dozens
 of computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the
 first case to challenge the practice.

 "The Secret Service didn't do a good job in this case. We know
 no investigation took place. Nobody ever gave any concern as to
 whether (legal) statutes were involved. We know there was
 damage," Sparks said in weighing damages.

 The lawsuit, brought by Steve Jackson Games of Austin, said
 that the seizure of three computers violated the Privacy
 Protection Act, which provides First Amendment protections
 against seizing a publisher's works in progress. The lawsuit
 further said that since one of the computers was being used to
 run a bulletin board system containing private electronic mail,
 the seizure violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
 in regards to the 388 callers of the Illuminati BBS.

 Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the
 Austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was
 never suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even
 marginal research to establish a criminal connection between
 the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee,
 or to determine that the company was a publisher. Indeed,
 agents testified that they were not even trained in the Privacy
 Protection Act at the special Secret Service school on computer
 crime.

 "How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what
 Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour?

 "Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to
 Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything
 taken?

 "Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it
 had a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying
 citizen -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?

 "Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this
 material could harm Steve Jackson economically?"

 Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own
 answer.

 "You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually
 go out and hire a lawyer and sue you."

 More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier
 Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded
 by Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in
 large part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.

 "The dressing-down of the Secret Service for their behavior is
 a major vindication of what we've been saying all along, which
 is that there were outrageous actions taken against Steve
 Jackson that hurt his business and sent a chilling effect to
 everyone using bulletin boards, and that there were larger
 principles at stake," said Kapor, contacted at his Cambridge,
 Mass., office.

 "We're very happy with the way the case came out," said Shari
 Steele, who attended the case as counsel for the EFF. "That
 session with the judge and Tim Foley is what a lawyer dreams
 about."

 That session seemed triggered by a riveting cross-examination
 of Foley by Pete Kennedy, Jackson's attorney.

 Kennedy forced Foley to admit that the search warrant did not
 meet even the Service's own standards for a search-and-seizure,
 and did not establish that Jackson Games was suspected of being
 involved in any illegal activity.

 "Agent Foley, it's been almost three years. Has Chris Goggans
 been indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship been indicted? Has Loyd
 Blankenship's computer been returned to him?"

 The purported membership of Jackson Games employee Blankenship
 in the Legion of Doom hacker's group triggered the raids that
 day on Jackson Games, Blankenship's home, and that of Goggans,
 a Houstonian who at the time was a University of Texas student.
 No charges have been filed, although the computer seized from
 Blankenship's home -- containing his wife's dissertation --
 never has been returned.

 After the cross-examination, Sparks questioned Foley on a
 number of key details before and after the raid, focusing on
 the holes in the search warrant, why Jackson was not allowed to
 copy his work in progress after it was seized, and why his
 computers were not returned after the Secret Service analyzed
 them, a process completed before the end of March.

 "The examination took seven days, but you didn't give Steve
 Jackson's computers back for three months. Why?" asked an
 incredulous Sparks. "So here you are, with three computers, 300
 floppy disks, an owner who was asking for it back, his attorney
 calling you, and what I want to know is why copies of
 everything couldn't be given back in days. Not months. Days.

 "That's what makes you mad about this case."

 The Justice Department contended that Jackson Games is a
 manufacturer, and that only journalistic organizations can call
 upon the Privacy Protection Act. It contended that the ECPA was
 not violated because electronic mail is not "intercepted" when
 a BBS is seized. This argument rests on a narrow definition of
 interception.

If you're a PDP-10 assembly language programer, this poem has particularly
nihilist overtones.

You have to know that the opcodes SKIP and JUMP are both no-ops on the
PDP-10.  SKIPE means "skip if equal to zero", SKIPL "skip if less than
zero", SKIPA "skip always", SKIP "skip never".  It's sort of an old
inside joke.

That's the thing about great poetry.  Each reader plucks new fruit from it.

Subj:   Hopefully

        Actually, this whole controversy is dead and most folks who cared
        about "hopefully" have died and gone to heaven, hopefully.

For Christmas I got a copy of the Third Edition of the American
Heritage Dictionary.  They have a very extensive usage note for
"hopefully", talking all about the politics and the controvery, etc.
Apparently the American Heritage "usage panel" is overwhelmingly
against the use of "hopefully" as a sentence adverb.  However, the
editor of the dictionary who wrote the usage note quite clearly agree
with you (and me).  He says that there simply aren't any good grounds
for objection, but that objecting has become a litmus test for people
concerned with grammar (or something like that), and he warns you that
there are still critics out there and you may have to take that into
account when you use the word.  All in all I think he explains the
current situation well.  I'm glad he decided to (tactfully but firmly)
override his usage panel on this one.

        I got tons more complaints on my confusion about Pepe Le Pew's
        seduction techniques and targets than I did about libelling
        Baudelaire.  Look to your values, people!  The first graders of
        today are the second graders of next year!  Is this the heritage
        we are leaving them?

                                    =*=

        To set the record straight, Pepe is particularly attracted to
        black female cats with fluffy tails who through some misadventure
        have ended up with a white stripe down the back, thus appearing to
        the ever-ardent Pepe as members of his own species.  And I'm oh so
        sorry I implied that JO thought that Pepe was a cat.  He is a cool
        cat, but Mephitis mephitis all the way.  JO protests that Pepe is
        the most widely admired Frenchman of the 20th century, but I think
        Pepe must be Québecois 'cause there ain't no skunks native to
        France (except the waiters).  Mam'selle Hepzibah is another French
        skunk.  What is it about skunks that makes cartoonists think they
        are particularly French?  Maybe it's the distaste for baths and
        deodorantes, suggests Paul Winalski.

        Someone protested against Speedy González on behalf of the
        Chicanos, but a poll revealed that Chicanos were inordinately fond
        of Speedy and considered him a fine representative of la raza.
        ¡Andale!  ¡Andale!  ¡Arriba!  Incidentally, they are proud to be
        Chicanos and commonly use the term in referring to themselves.

        Lots of reports from the Wild Kingdom (Grab him, Jim!).  Last
        ish had lots of lubricity in it.  This one has lots of fur and
        feathers (and no lubricity, although fur and feathers have their
        place there as well).

        Well, Pepe is lubricous.  But not J. Edgar, no matter how well he
        dressed.

        I just got back from a winter camping trip and it turns out that
        snowshoes are just the thing for walking in the snow.
