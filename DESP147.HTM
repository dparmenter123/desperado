With all this brouhaha about abuse of corporate resources, I've been
wondering just how abusive the genial and popular Mr. Covert and your
cultured and charming hostess are. But what the hell, this hardly
constitutes a chain letter, and it does create a strong sense of
electronic community (at least it does if I'm doing it right, but I
figure those of you who are appalled by frivolity have dropped out in
disgust long since) and anyway, the company holds me down to 5% raises, I'm
gonna get my jollies wherever I can, know what I mean? Within the bounds of
strictest propriety, you understand.

Now, what is the season of the year which is making us all so itchy and
stuffy and gummy? Why, it's summer, so it is, and the pollen up here in
New England has to be breathed to be believed. And you know
how I love to hear what you've all been up to. So I broadcast the appeal
yet again: what *did* you do on your summer vacation? You look so bronzed!
So fit! So tired! You must have had a marvellous time -- tell me *all
about it! Later in this ish, I'm going to break off and tell you all
about Charleston, South Carolina, where I just spent a scented week
attending too many concerts and eating too much Cajun blackened catfish.

On that slim pretext, a story about Ernest Hemingway...

William Faulkner once told Ernest Hemingway that Faulkner could write
a successful screenplay of, in Faulkner's opinion, Hemingway's worst short
story. I don't remember the name of the short story, but the movie is one
of the best Bogart flicks: _To_Have_and_Have_Not_, famous for the movie
debut of the ace smolderer, Lauren Bacall. Screenplay contains the deathless
line, "You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve. You just put your lips
together and blow." ANYWAY, Faulkner invited Hemingway out to Hollywood
to discuss the screenplay and the terms, and to try to soothe Papa's ruffled
feathers.  He invited Ernest and Clark Gable to go with him up to the mountains
and kill salmon. On the way, Gable was trying to make conversation, never an
easy task with Hemingway, and he asked the classic opener, "Tell me, Mr.
Hemingway, what is it you do?" And Hemingway, all bristles and innocence,
replied in astonishment,  "I'm a writer. What do you do?"

Well, I guess you had to be there. Onward and upward...

Subj:   Mr. Ed is an agent of the DEVIL!!!

It so happens that I used to live in Franklin Furnace, Ohio, which is
about ten miles from Ironton, Ohio, which is where the evangelicist
who is concerned with the Mr. Ed theme preaches.  This sort of
thinking is nothing new to the area.

When I lived with my grandmother, she attended the Jeanetts Creek
Baptist Church.  They were good-souled people (unless you did
something that they didn't approve of) but perhaps a little
credulous.  In 1977 when I visited Grandma over Christmas break from
college, we attended the service there.  That day they had a guest
evangelicist, who traveled about a good deal, preaching all over the
area.

His sermon was about the horrible danger of The Great Beast, the
COMPUTER, 666 (I am quoting here) that was as LARGE as a ROOM, and
KNEW SOMETHING about EVERYBODY!!!!  And it was PLOTTING to take over
the WORLD!!!!

Naturally, everyone there (well, not quite everyone) was very
concerned about this hideous danger.  There was much wailing and
weeping and moaning, and many, many AMENS! and THAT's RIGHTs! being
uttered all around.

And connected with this terrible insturment of the Devil was a new
bank in Cleveland (hotbed of SIN) that required that everyone have
the numeral 666 tatooed on their palm.  To get money out, you had to
submit and talk to the Computer, the BEAST 666.

Of course, they were talking about Automatic Teller Machines (no!)
Since I was at the time a sophomore in computer science, I decided
that it was best not to attend this particular church for any further
meetings.

that only backward people need worry about the devil.

Subj:   Dave Barry on Board

            Here's an excerpt from a Dave Barry article that involves -
        of all things - those CHILD ON BOARD portable blind spots.  I
        think Dave Barry is uniquely qualified to discuss this issue.
        He knows about children, because he has raised one to be three
        years old (and then some) without it becoming an ax murderer or
        anything (or so he claims).  He's also an expert on boards:  his
        career as a do-it-yourself columnist was launched with a "How to
        Make a Board" article.
                        &lt;_Jym_&gt;

  What can we do now? We can do something about these large stickers people
have taken to putting in the back windows of their cars, the ones that say:
"CHILD ON BOARD." Chances are you've seen these and asked yourself: What are
these people saying with these stickers? Do they think that if they DIDN'T have
the stickers, the rest of us would think: "Huh! Looks like there's no child
aboard that car! I guess I'll speed up and have an accident with it!"

  What I figure is, these people are telling us they have children on board
because they're PROUD of this fact. They want us to NOTICE. And I say that we,
as involved citizens, should make them happy. At stoplights, we should honk our
horns, get out of our cars and call to other motorists: "LOOK! That car over
there has a CHILD ON BOARD!!" Then we should all gather around and press our
faces up against the car windows, staring at the child with frank admiration,
perhaps refusing to leave until we have obtained wallet photographs. Wouldn't
that be great? Come on, concerned citizens! Let's not wait for the "other guy"
to do it!

``Scientists have been hunched over lab benches for several decades now in an
attempt to untangle the mysteries of the double helix -- the Ladder of Life, as
some call it, or the Escalator of Evolution, as it is known to others.  At
first, most of their discoveries related to phenomena with only small
followings, such as albinism and various illnesses.  But lately, employing the
awesome power of sixty-mile-long tunnels of speeding protein beneath the Swiss
Alps, they have begun to probe deeper, playing with the very Legos of Life.  A
whole range of previously unexplained phenomena, including unwillingness to
write home from college, lust, and the feeling that one really could concoct a
better screenplay than THAT, turn out to have genetic explanations.  Researchers
have discovered that the strongest urge (a red and noticeably enlarged link in
the Chain of Creation) is the desire to leave one's job in the city, move to the
countryside, and take up an idyllic rural life.  The body has erected a number
of ingenious natural defenses against this desire;  for instance, it is now
posited by responsible scholars that the invention of the ballet was
biologically necessary in order to provide some attraction unique to the city
which would prevent the overpopulation of Vermont.''

Subj:   Info. on Management in US

Excess of Managers Causing Decline of U.S.
------------------------------------------

Carole Patton's April 3 Professional Notebook (p.223) was
superb. She has put her finger on the reason for decline of
the United States and the rise of Japan. If the engineers are
out of engineering and the nit-pickers and pebble-counters run
things via ever-increasing layers of bureaucratic paperwork,
what can be expected other than a return to the Stone
Age (Early Neolithic)? The Harvard Business School maxim,
"A good manager need know nothing about what he manages, only
how to manage," will go on many tombstones, including those
of the Challenger astronauts. When everyone is a manager, I
ask, who will work? As we say, "A manager is like an artichoke;
peel all the layers off and nothing remains," or "The reason
managers always swim in circles is so they keep moving and
stay in the same place."

Here's the info for entering B-L, from the book "It Was a Dark and Stormy
Night -- The Best (?) from the Bulwer-Lytton Contest":

        The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is an annual event that
        asks entrants to compose the worst possible opening sentence
        to a novel.  Anyone anywhere may enter.  The rules are simple:

        1)  Sentences may be of any length and entrants may submit
            more than one, but all entries must be original and
            previously unpublished.

        2)  Entries will be judged by categories, from "general" to
            detective, western, science fiction, romance, and so on.
            There will be overall winners as well as category winners.

        3)  Entries should be submitted on index cards, the sentence
            on one side and the entrant's name, address, and phone
            number on the other.

        4)  The deadline is April 15 (chosen because Americans associate
            it with another painful submission).

I know you've been scanning forward looking for the dope on Charleston,
breathless with anticipation. Listen, it's a slow news day, I'm padding as
much as I can. This is the second time I've been to Charleston with my
reason for living, and each time I come home convinced that if only
DEC had an office in the historic district, I'd sell my winter coat and
move South, to take my chances with the hurricanes. We went down for the
Spoleto Festival, an annual musical orgy. It is possible to attend five
concerts in one day (I know, I've done it. Once.)

High point, believe it or not, was Circus Flora (named for a baby elephant),
rendered acceptably cultural by being a reproduction of a nineteenth
century Italian family circus, and pretty heavenly it was! Think of your
childhood vision of a circus, before you had ever been to one, and this
platonic ideal, this ur-circus, is exactly what Circus Flora turned out
to be! No lions and tigers and bears, oh my, but a baby elephant, and
a large collection of the most imposing horses and curvaceous, scantily
dressed equestriennes. There were a couple of Wallendas on hand walking
the tightrope, and perfectly fearless trapeze artists. And glorious
clowns, notably one dressed as dogcatcher, with a little dog just like
your childhood visions of circus dogs: little, fat, smooth white coat,
and a black ring around one eye. No "Is that all there is?" about  this one!

We didn't just go to the circus, but somehow I don't think you want to
hear about the chamber music concerts and the Stravinsky opera and
the most sublime choral concert I've ever heard. You might however
enjoy knowing that I went to a jazz concert with Bobby McFerrin,
the supreme scat artist of all time, and heard a little rock and
roll from the lips and elsewhere of the Bobs, a loony San Francisco
new wave a cappella group. David Byrne meets the Hi-Los, I give you
my word.

Then, too, there was the food. Oh, was there the food. The restaurants in
Charleston are among the best anywhere. Between the seafood (Cajun blackened
redfish! Yay!) and the Italian vera cucina (rotini alla marinara with
mussels that had died of garlic overdose) and the she-crab soup, we
had a wonderful gluttonous time. I'd tell you about desserts to make
you weep with shame, but we didn't have any. We were always in a hurry
to make the next concert!

Enough about me and my rest and recreation, on to our next guest.
On further perusal, this is not a summer vacation, as it happens, but it
certainly qualifies as a travelogue within the meaning of the act,
subclassification, cultural reflections.

Subj:   A Visit to Saskatoon by Lew Lasher

In case you didn't know, the University of Saskatchewan is located on an
80-or-so year old site in Saskatoon, a city about the size of Manchester,
New Hampshire, that straddles the South Saskatchewan River in more-or-less
central Saskatchewan, a province in Western Canada somewhere in between
the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes.  Saskatoon is named after a local
berry that we didn't get a chance to eat because we got to the museum after
the coffee shop there closed.  I don't know whether Saskatchewan is also
named after the berry, but I do now know that the first syllable in
"Saskatchewan" is quite unstressed, as is, I should also add, the first
syllable in "Toronto."

The recurring question for an American visitor to Canada is how you can
tell you're in Canada and not in the United States.  Part of the problem
is the very language I've just used: "American" is the adjective form of
"United States of America", but can also be construed to encompass two
large continents that include such exotica as Ecuador, Nicaragua and
Rio de Janeiro in addition to Peoria and Saskatoon.  A Quebecois sitting
next to me on the plane ride to Saskatoon said that it's OK to use
"American" (or, in his case, "americain(e)") as an adjective to refer
to the U.S., but that the noun "America" ("l'Amerique") takes in the whole
extravaganza.  The French language portion of the Air Canada magazine
even used an adjective "etatsunisien(ne)" (roughly translatable as
"Unitedstatesian") for us South-of-their-Border types.  One sees in
Canada at times the desire to be grouped along with the U.S., by the
use of the phrase "North America" (a geographical entity found in the
U.S. primarily on world maps), as in newspaper ads that proclaim a
particular car model to be "the best selling hatchback in North America."

Yet, I would suppose that most Canadians would prefer to have their own
country, rather than be an appendix to the United States.  As a Torontonian
I broached this subject with a couple of years ago said, "there's a lot of
subtle British influence here that you don't see at first that distinguishes
us from the U.S."  I suppose.  We did see some offices labeled "Barristers
and Solicitors", a definite sign of British influence right there.  But we
also saw a lot of very familiar items: the Ramada Inn, MacDonald's, Sears,
and Hondas.  (One distinguishing point was their pronunciation of "Mazda"
to rhyme with "has the.")  If anything, the British influence seemed
attenuated and struggling against the competition of the American influence.

Fortunately for the sake of Canadian resistance to American influence,
the U.S. government seems to act effortlessly in opposition to or in ignorance
of Canadian interests, enough to keep Canadians from falling into complacency.
The latest example, generally under-reported in the American media, has been
the U.S.-led tariff war between these two countries having the largest
bilateral trade of any pair in the world.  Fortunately for our trip (somehow
I had to drift back from world politics to our own little adventure) the
Canadian victims have so far been in the lumber industry in British Columbia,
far enough from the wheat farmers and potash miners who continue, so far as
I can tell, to prosper in Saskatchewan.

One noticeable Canadian feature is the token bilingualism that gives a dash
of international flavor to the otherwise bland prairie.  Although the
Quebecois on the airplane mused that bilingualism in Canada had to be
practiced only by the French-speaking, there were some respectable signs
(literally, come to think of it) at the airport and at government offices,
considering the miniscule Francophone minority in Saskatoon.  Val Veillard
(whose first language is English despite her French heritage) pointed out
the new French bookstore, where I bought a couple of computer books in
French.  Oddly, these were not imported from France, but translated by
Canadian publishers from original English text for the U.S. market.

The largest minority in Saskatoon is the Ukrainians, but we missed out
on the Ukrainian restaurant Thursday night after I spent too much time
shopping, among other places, at the French bookstore.  Back to the
French, though: Val said that it has become fashionable among Canadian
prairie yuppies to send their children to something called "French immersion
school."  So I suppose the Torontonian of two paragraphs ago was right in a
sense: if you observe enough about a place and its people, you can even
find differences between Canadians and (U.S. of) Americans.

Because of the timing of our flights, I left regretting that I had not
visited half the places I had hoped to, an odd regret leaving a city
that really doesn't have all that much to see.  Still, if anyone else
around here has the privilege of traveling out to Saskatoon before I
do again, I'd appreciate a report on the Ukrainian restaurant(s), the
zoo, the art gallery, and the R.C.M.P. station.  Skip the Toyota dealer;
I'll bet they've got the same stuff as they do here in the non-Canadian
sector of North America.

I assume they should get recognition for truth-in-advertising (I didn't stop
so we'll have to take their word on the aesthetics).

                                    ( *
                                      /
                                     /
                                    (___}
                                       /
                                     _/_

Do you sense a certain disenchantment with the kitty logo? Tell you what.
I'll entertain guest logos. If you have a graphic at least four lines
long, send it along and I'll print the best of them.

                        LET A HUNDRED LOGOS BLOOM!
