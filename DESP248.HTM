                Andre the Giant -- I've been particularly remembering the
                era in which the Giant was a villain wrestler.  Here was a
                man who was clearly one of the nicest kindest gentlest
                people on the face of the earth, ranting and roaring like
                some tag team of Rick Rude and George the Animal Steele.

                Dizzy Gillespie -- There was an LP out of Canada called
                "Jazz at Massey Hall" featuring both Charlie Parker and
                Dizzy.  Bird introduced the band, naming Diz as "my worthy
                constituent", a little dig at Diz, but a fair one.  Not
                the innovator that Bird was (no one was that), Diz taught
                the world how to play bebop by explaining the musical
                theory that Bird couldn't be bothered to expound.  Diz was
                kicked out of Cab Calloway's trumpet section as a lad;
                Cab's exit review:  "I don't want nobody playing that
                Chinese music in my band."  I have a great 10-inch LP with
                Dizzy under a pseudonym playing an amazingly fast
                12-minute version of "Sweet Georgia Brown".

        I like the way Clinton is getting all his mistakes out of the way
        early in the administration.

        The scam he's pulling with gays in the military is particularly
        cool.  He says he's gonna do it.  The right wing freaks.  He says,
        Oh, not now, I meant in six months.  The right wing thinks it has
        won.  In six months everyone's bored with it and there you have
        it.

        The primary problem the objectors have is *acknowledging* that
        there are gays in the military.  There's never been much of a
        problem with having 'em in there manning the machine guns.  In
        fact, in wartime, the gay ban is officially relaxed.  It's only in
        peace time that the military complains about gays and the
        complaint seems to have boiled down to we don't wanna know about
        it or talk about it.

        responsible for putting the light touch into rhythm&amp;blues that we
        have come to know as rock&amp;roll. In other words, he invented a lot
        of what we are still hearing. Good to have him in there.

        See?  Everybody in the Rock&amp;Roll Hall o' Fame isn't famous.  Some

Subj:   The Death Of Buck Naked

It's a good thing that Desperados (Desperadi?) are scattered across the
globe the way they are. It prevents organizations like the Tri-Lateral
Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations from pulling the wool over
our eyes.

Take, for example, the so-called "death" of Mr. Buck Naked reported in
Desperado #3073. I can state for a fact that Mr. Buck Naked is alive and
well in Raleigh, North Carolina because I hear him live on the radio on
many mornings and afternoons doing one  of those helicopter-in-the-sky
traffic reports on 93.9 FM (WZZU). His traffic reports are fairly typical
of what you would hear on other radio stations except that he ends each
one with "For WZZU Traffic, I'm Buck Naked!"

This boggles the mind with possibilities. Why was Mr. Naked's death
staged? Why did he have to give up his music career? Why Raleigh? How does
he fly a helicopter while wearing a "plumber's helper"?

I don't know the answers, but I'm sure that this is just the tip of the
iceberg. Who knows what dark and nefarious schemes lay just beneath the
surface?

      Further to the ambitions idea floated a while back:

      It must have been second sight that made me think of ambitions
      outside Digital a while back because the old downsizing bandwagon
      has caught up with me at last. This has stimulated a fair bit of
      serious thought, a fair bit of whimsical thought and just a dash of
      rage to season the necessary activity to find another job. Like
      many of us, I occasionally think of the advantage of working for
      myself if only the right idea comes along. Meanwhile I have been
      taking the odd trip up to the capital (thats London, England for
      the rednecks out there (do rednecks read? (this)))(maybe I could
      learn LISP) just to seek out jobs with the agencies that do that
      sort of thing.

      One such trip I came into the city on the line that takes you into
      Charing Cross Station. It was a good day, a fine view crossing
      the Thames just before the station and life seemed good. It was
      late in the morning and I was just a shade hungry so I was looking
      round for food. Saw just the place to set up a kiosk as well but it
      was empty. There's an opportunity I thought. Work for myself, sell
      fast food of some kind. What could I sell to make it a distinctive
      line. Nothing low end like MacDonalds but something with style and
      taste (like myself) and appealing enough to franchise off when
      success strikes irresistibly later this year. So visioning I set
      off for my appointment.

      It was a couple of days later when I happened to see a cookery
      programme on television that the ideas started to come together.
      With the opening up of access to China there is an increasing
      interest in Chinese foods and recipes. One such was being described
      - a real delicacy they said. The Chinese fresh water crab grows
      quite readily and is easily caught. Unlike the marine varieties the
      juveniles have quite a soft thin shell with little chalk in it. Th
      etrick is to kill the crabs by dropping them into hot water, then
      to lightly crush them with a pastry roller. They are then tossed in
      wonderful tasty sauces before being flamed on an open charcoal
      grill. A delicious snack to be eaten in ones or twos, more for a
      full meal, goes well with bread or pitta, easily carried about, no
      need for implements - the ideal fast food snack.

      Nothing now stands in my way. I will become the first person to
      serve Crushed Asian Crustaceans on Charing Cross Station.

                     A ROUGH OVERVIEW, A MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
                  HOW COME BLUE IS THE MOST COMMON FLOWER COLOR
                  AND YET THERE SEEM NOT TO BE ANY BLUE ROSES?

Subj:   Blue Roses

Hi, Tom. Here's the thing:

1) Why there are no blue roses (carnations, gerberas, chrysanthemums):

There are several blue flower pigments, but the most common ones are
members of a group that I will loosely call Anthocyanins (or
Anthocyanidins). The most common of these is a pigment called
Delphinidin, which was probably first isolated from delphiniums, hence
the name.

It turns out that the biosynthesis of this pigment involves adding 2
hydroxyl groups to a particular ring on a precursor molecule. This
ring contains a single hydroxyl group already.

That is, in the ordinary course of events you end up with molecules
that have 1, 2, or 3 hydroxyl groups on that particular ring. The
pigment with 1 hydroxyl group is called Pelargonidin (after the common
garden geranium, which is actually a member of the genus
_Pelargonium_), and is made from the original precursor molecule
without the addition of any further hydroxyl groups. It is a sharp
geranium-red color.

The one with 2 hydroxyls is called Cyanidin (for reasons I don't
understand, since it is pink to purple in color, and not Cyan at all),
and is made by adding one hydroxyl group to the precursor.

I've already mentioned the one with three hydroxyls.

The entire genus _Rosa_ lacks the enzyme that adds two hydroxyls to
the precursor molecule. Thus, no blue pigments in Roses, Apples,
Peaches, Pears, Apricots, Quinces, Almonds, Cherries... all of the
common stone fruits are roses, including even Medlars and Loquats (but
not Kumquats - those are citrus). (Medlars, Gracie? Never mind, we'll
deal with them some other time.)

The enzyme is a Cytochrome P-450 Hydroxylase. Several of these are
known, which is why it has a fairly generic name. This particular one
occurs in various plants, including Petunias. Petunias are apparently
reasonably well understood, which is why they get used here.

2) One more interesting item: My understanding (somewhat limited, to
be sure) is that the enzyme prefers to grab the 1-hydroxyl precursor
and add both hydroxyl groups to it, (though it is apparently known to
take the intermediate compound as well, at least in the lab). Thus, a
rose that produces Pelargonidin instead of Cyanidin might be a useful
thing to have. Until 1929, no such roses were known.

In that year a geranium-red Polyantha rose named `Gloria Mundi' was
introduced, and another (`Paul Crampel') the following year.

The problem with these two roses is that they are diploid, whereas
most modern roses are tetraploid. The workaround is another rose, a
Hybrid Tea rose that was released in this country in 1950. In the US,
its name is `Independence'. (The original name was `Kordes'
Sondermeldung', which refers to the hybridizer, Wilhelm Kordes, and
means "News Flash" or "Important Announcement". That is exactly what
it was: an extremely important "announcement" from Kordes Roses. This
rose introduced some very new colorations into the rose world.)

Why this particular mutation should occur three times over a very
few years after some 17 (or so) million years of rose evolution is a
mystery. It is handy for us that it did, though.

3) Now we have a good rose "substrate", and we have some notion of
where the enzyme occurs. What next?

First, you need to track the enzyme back to the gene that governs its
production. This is a nontrivial exercise. Fortunately, all of the
Cytochrome P-450 hydroxylases (and possibly other Cytochrome P-450
enzymes - I know very little about these compounds) share a certain
amount of DNA sequence. It turns out to be possible to use a copy of
that sequence as a probe. If you break the chromosomes of a plant up
into genes and untwist the DNA into single strands, you can grab the
P-450 genes by combining them with this particular piece of DNA.  In
order to make enough copies of the particular sequence to do this kind
of thing, you make use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, which was
written up in Scientific American by its inventor, in 1991 or 1992. (I
think it was '92, but I don't have the issue in front of me. The
author is Kary B. Mullis, however, and I think the name of the
reaction is the title of the article.)

Once you have figured out which gene is the correct one, also not a
trivial thing to do, you use PCR once again to make a bunch of copies
of it. (In fact, there seem to be two genes in _Petunia_ that code for
this enzyme. They have now been identified.)

4) Well and good, but how do you get the DNA into the rosebush?

It turns out that there are several possible methods.

        1) You strip the cell walls off some cells and just expose
them to quantities of the DNA in question. Maybe some of them take
some of it up. Maybe a few of those actually integrate it into their
own DNA. Maybe. This is a very inefficient method, and may or may not
work in any particular instance. Let's kiss it off and find something
better.

        2) You pump the stuff into the cell with a shotgun. (You think
I'm kidding, don't you?) In this method, the DNA strands are stuck on
tiny pellets, and are quite literally blasted into the cells with a
gun, no kidding. It's not your ordinary Saturday Night Special,
though. I think it uses .22-caliber blanks. This method has been used
a number of times, but I actually think the third method is more
likely to be the one used for this project, and besides, it's very
interesting:

        3) There is a very odd bacterium that infects the dead cells
at the edges of injuries in plants. It then uses a plasmid to inject
some DNA of its own into the neighboring cells. The DNA it injects is
a tumor-inducing gene. The bacterium is named _Agrobacterium_
_tumefaciens_. There was an interesting article by Mary-Dell Chilton
in the June (I think) 1983 Scientific American about using this
bacterium to inject different genes, genes chosen by researchers,
into plant cells.  What you do is about as follows:

* Isolate the gene you want.

* Splice it to a gene for antibiotic resistance. (I believe that
Kanamycin is the usual antibiotic.) The reason for this will become
apparent.

* Open up the plasmid, and remove the tumor-inducing gene.

* Substitute your chosen DNA.

* Use PCR to make many copies of the plasmid

* Put the plasmid back into some _Agrobacterium_ cells from which you
have removed the plasmids. (They may even have a mutant version that
just doesn't make plasmids; I don't know.)

* Use these to infect some plant cells.

The way you do _that_ is to take a leaf, make slits in it, put it on a
culture medium that contains Kanamycin, and pour your bacteria over
it.  They infect the dead cells at the edges of the slits. Then they
inject their little plasmids into the neighboring cells. ONLY the ones
with Kanamycin resistance can live on the culture medium, so ONLY the
ones in which the plasmids successfully inserted genes into the cell
DNA will survive.

Then you grow those single cells into plants. (He said, blithely. Have
you ever tried to grow a whole plant from little pile of callus
growing on culture medium? It ain't easy. I could write a piece that's
longer than this one, just about _in_vitro_ plant growing, and I
hardly know a thing about it yet.)

5) The price: I think it cost them $10 or $20 MILLION to do this
project... Erg!!

If I recall correctly, the press releases and articles indicate that
they hope to have blue roses growing in the lab some time this year.

In case anyone is moved to complain about wasting money, I suggest
that they think long and hard about whether they'd like to put up the
millions for someone to learn some of these techniques in the effort
to deal with things like Malaria, Leprosy, or the AIDS virus. The
technology is very similar, and the lab work is probably even more
similar. Let us have our blue roses (carnations, gerberas,
chrysanthemums): good will come of it elsewhere. You can't do this
kind of technology in a vacuum, you know.

Hope that's not too boring, abstruse, or badly written. Hope it gives
you at least some idea of the scope of the project. I've necessarily
left out a whole bunch of stuff, like all the research about the
pigments themselves, and all the research that led them to the enzyme
&amp; its gene: there's a ton of info in there somewhere.

Cheers

MOVING SLIME CAPTIVATES CHINESE SCIENTISTS

Beijing (Reuters) - Chinese scientists are studying a massive slime
mold that weighs 77 pounds and "can move slowly across the ground on
its own," the official Xinhua news agency said yesterday.

The slime was found in a river in the northwestern province of Shaanxi
in August and gained 22 pounds within three days.

"Specialists at the biology department of Northwest University in Xian
have determined that it is related to fungus and it is still alive,"
the agency said.

"It is usually found in cool, moist and dark places such as grassland,
rotted logs and withered leaves, and it can move across the ground
slowly on its own," it said.

The slime find is a boon for scientists, although it may be
short-lived.

Xinhua said slime mold was found in Dallas in 1973, but "died a week
after its discovery."

Subj:   The Latest Perverted Bay Area Fad

=v= Here in the Bay Area we have a tangible sense of a mission
to act as if we're the most sexually enlightened and gnarly folx
in the world.  Akbar &amp; Jeff's Piercing Hut ("you've tried the
rest, now try ritualistic body mutilation!!") is old news here.
The latest fad has been written up in one of our weekly rags,
_The_East_Bay_Express_.  Attached below.

Best Place to Get a Toe Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Catherine McEver

A hot tip from a staff member at the Oakland Museum has opened
up a whole new world of sensual pleasures for the sybarites
among us who get a kick out of having their toes sucked.

It turns out that those plump, gorgeous koi swimming around
in the pond near the main entrance of the museum aren't just
another bunch of pretty fish; theyre a talented pool of toe
suckers.  Simply shuck off your shoes and socks and delicately
dip the tip of your big toe into the water, wiggling it
seductively to draw attention.  In seconds the koi will come
to investigate and one of the more forward fish will swim in
close, capture your toe lovingly in its mouth, and give it a
satisfying suck or two.

The staff member who turned us on to this titillating pastime
likens the sensation to a French kiss, though that description
would seem to be more apt from the fish's point of view.  From
a human perspective, the experience is a thrilling adventure in
fish-to-[human] communication; a special interspecies moment
you'll want to cherish forever and tell your grandchildren
about.  If you decide to take the plunge, practice safe sex
and common courtesy towards the koi by making sure that the
toe in question is come-hither clean.

"French-kissing" is when you stick your tongue into her mouth, and she sticks
her tongue into your mouth, and so there the two of you are, with your tongues
in each other's mouths.  This is a really sexy thing to do, according to French
people, although you should bear in mind that they also like to eat snails.

Subj:   FWD: Modern Methods of Crowd Control (fwd)

I guess I like the wrong kind of music!

        SEATTLE (UPI) -- Crowd control at rock 'n' roll shows in Seattle
 includes projections of topless women and girls on concert video
 screens.
        Police operation orders issued prior to a concert Tuesday night at
 the Kingdome by the heavy metal rock bands Guns N' Roses and Metallica
 advised officers that promoters would project images of bare breasts on
 the concert screens to counter rowdy behavior.
        The order said, in part, ``Females will be boosted onto the shoulders
 of companions, where they will expose their breasts to a camera that
 projects the image on the big screen. This form of entertainment has
 served to keep the crowd in check.''
        Concert promoter Dan Bean of Entertainment Consultants Inc. said the
 sight does tend to help control crowds between performances by the
 bands.
        Bean said promoters do not arrange such actions. Such acvitity by
 women and girls in the crowd is spontaneous, he said.
        Police said 24 people were arrested and another 37 cited at the sold-
 out Seattle concert, which attracted about 40,000.
        The arrests mostly involved assaults, drug offenses and public
 drinking, police said.

Deaf jams across the Pacific
By Jac Zinder {published in the L.A. Weekly}

"Most of the tattooed and rubber-clad thrill seekers at Club F2k!
expected nothing unusual on the October evening that Cosmic
Coincidence Control Center was scheduled to play.  On their first time
in town, nobody knew much about Japanoise band CCCC (a.k.a. Chaotic
Custom Cock Comandoes), except that they were supposed to be really
loud.  Around midnight, Hiroshi Hasegawa, a longhaired, shabbily
dressed Japanese fellow, walked onstage and started diddling with the
knobs of a primitive analog synthesizer.  As the Revolting Cocks'
industrial anthem "Beers, Steers and Queers" faded out, a chilling
racket, louder than anyone had hoped for, blasted through the PA.

Oceans of distortion, overdrive, high-pitched squeals and screams
sounded like a high-powered lawnmower, desperately in need of a
tune-up, running over a rodent strapped to a metal sheet.  It was
shrill and brain-numbingly low simultaneaously.  Myuko Hino, a lovely
Japanese performance artist in a fire-engine-red kimono, tiptoed on
stage.  Bending down, she slowly lit a row of red penis-shaped
candles, opened up her kimono and proceeded to tie her nude body up in
stunning displays of Japanese bondage, running the rope between her
legs, around her breasts, as the sound ripped through the club,
skyrocketing in volume and density.

Bound, Hino then picked up a candle and dripped a stream of hot wax on
her face, neck and breasts.  It was like a sadomasochistic-noise Bhuto
dance performance.  The audience stared, slack-jawed and glassy-eyed,
with fingers in their ears.  As the noise faded out, the silence was
deafening.  After a moment the dazed, drained audience listlessly
applauded.  The DJ spun a record, but it just wasn't the same.  The
pesky thing about noise is that it feels so good when it stops, but it
doesn't exactly stop when it finishes."

[The article is accompanied by `Before and after' photographs, the
after one showing Hino with rivers of candle wax running down her neck
from her eyes, nostrils and mouth]

Subj:   Booth bimbos

Tom --

I thought you might like the article on booth bimbos and the related
article on X-rated CDROMs.  I remember a coworker many years ago who
couldn't stop talking about the booth bimbos -- blonde twins -- at
some trade show we went to.  I haven't been to a trade show in years,
but apparently booth bimbos are still out there.

TidBITS#159/18-Jan-93
=====================

 We continue with coverage of Macworld Expo, focussing this time on
   the seamy underside of the show. That's right, booth bimbos!
   Madonna's "Sex" it's not, but we also look at the rapidly
   growing crop of adult CD-ROMs. In more mundane Macworld news,
   we have an article on Apple's new printers and scanner, a short
   review of Now Up-to-Date 2.0, and clarifications of earlier
   articles on the IIvx and A/UX, the Video Toaster, and the
   FirstClass BBS deals.

Booth Bimbos
------------
  Those of you who have gone to Macworld have encountered the booth
  bimbo phenomenon. It's not a sexist phenomenon as such, applying
  equally to the pretty young men and women who work as scenery at
  various booths. Universally, these people have no clue about the
  products they represent; instead they hand out buttons and
  propaganda, smile nicely, and act as props for the larger show
  that goes on around them.

  It's easy to condemn large companies for using booth bimbos
  instead of bringing some of their overworked and underpaid
  technical support staff, some of whom even look like normal people
  and most of whom will answer most any technical question. Small
  companies that have small staffs should get a little slack,
  although you wonder how they can afford to spend so much money on
  a large booth that needs booth bimbos, but can't afford or don't
  need the staff normally. Smaller companies like Aladdin, Dantz,
  and Nisus manage without booth bimbos, pressing their entire
  staffs and the occasional friends, relatives, or significant
  others into service as necessary.

  The subject of booth bimbos rises to the surface every Macworld in
  one way or another, buoyed by hot air, fluff, and hairspray, and
  this year it was prompted by a real-world description of what a
  booth bimbo will go through to look "sexy, but not sleazy... or
  maybe just a little bit sleazy." The booth bimbo in question
  lacked a certain physical attribute to achieve the required look,
  but being resourceful (she apparently described herself as a
  drummer, dancer, and actress - I wonder if she added booth bimbo
  to her resume?) she enhanced herself with two cleverly placed
  sweatsocks and about nine feet of duct tape (right, the sticky,
  strong, grey stuff) to create the illusion of bustiness.

  After squirming into the booth's costume, a petite jumpsuit that
  zipped up the front, she lowered the zipper to just above the duct
  tape region and then employed the age-old technique of finding an
  excuse to constantly bend down for maximum cleavage exposure. And
  all most people wanted was specs and to find out if the product
  being hawked was compatible with their existing hardware. Sigh.

  Perhaps this story is an extreme look at previously secret booth
  bimbo techniques, but it comes from a reputable and rather
  irritated source closely placed to this particular booth bimbo. If
  you have an especially funny booth bimbo story, send it to us, and
  perhaps we'll do a "Best of the Bimbos" article. Eventually
  companies will realize that showgoers don't give a damn about a
  extra skin or sexy hair styles. It's certainly never entered my
  product choice process - can you imagine? "Well, WhizzyWriter has
  all the features I need, but the babes at the WriteStuff booth
  sure were cute. I'll buy the WriteStuff instead." Get real,
  people. It's not as though there's even an image involved with
  most of this stuff. "If I buy the WriteStuff bodacious women will
  see me as a macho hombre studpuffin and drape themselves over my
  body whenever I'm writing."

  I'd like to suggest to any company that feels it needs booth
  bimbos at the next show that they instead buy some life-size
  blow-up party dolls of both sexes, dress them in appropriate
  costumes, and pose them in anatomically correct booth bimbo
  positions with some propaganda in their inflatable hands. Think of
  the money saved and the smiles it will create. Alternately,
  unchain another tech support person from the phones. They like
  that sort of thing.

Booth Bimbos on CD-ROM?
-----------------------
  The last Expo in Boston was the first time we saw pornography
  seriously hit CD-ROM, with BodyCello displaying the first
  QuickTime adult movies. I wasn't surprised to see that, but this
  year a startling number of vendors hawked X-rated wares. I didn't
  see the CD-ROM of Macworld Booth Bimbos, but I'm sure, now that
  I've mentioned it, it will appear at the next show. You know,
  grainy QuickTime movies of naked men and women getting it on with
  SCSI devices while wrapping each other in DAT tape taken from the
  latest backup set in the heat of passion. Heady stuff.

  I counted at least four, and maybe five vendors selling adult
  CD-ROMs. Most included pictures or QuickTime movies, although one
  had gone so far as to build a game into the CD-ROM so you had to
  win to see skin. The game? Nothing too challenging - scissors,
  paper, rock against a random computer picker. Reactor advertised
  Virtual Valerie II, though I didn't see a demo so it might not be
  shipping. Based on the handout, Valerie and her environs have been
  rendered in 3-D this time, but game play remains similar.

  I commented on the increase to a man working at one of these
  booths, and he said that they market what sells, and sex sells. I
  guess he's right, although I wonder why people put up with low-
  resolution photos and terrible QuickTime movies (using a slower
  machine with less RAM to watch these movies results in lousy
  performance, in all senses of the word) when they can visit a
  video store and choose from lots of titles or buy a Playboy with
  high-quality, full-color photos and those gripping interviews that
  everyone pretends to read instead of ogling the models. Then
  again, as Gerard van der Leun said in the premiere issue of Wired
  magazine, "Sex is a virus that infects new technology first." That
  explains the initial popularity of VCRs, and it looks as though a
  number of vendors believe the same thing will happen with CD-ROM
  drives. In the same "This is a Naked Lady" article, Gerard also
  said, "Sex, as we know, is a heat-seeking missile that forever
  seeks out the newest medium for its transmission." Seems apt.

  Of course, if I truly objected I would not provide all the phone
  numbers. But then again, if I were offended by this stuff, I
  wouldn't have written this article. I think the movement is
  interesting, though I would far rather play The Journeyman Project
  on CD-ROM once Apple ships the AppleCD 300; although the latest
  rumors we've heard on that front say not to hold your breath, as
  you will turn blue and die well before the external CD-ROM drives
  appear at your dealer. It seems that Apple doesn't have enough of
  them, and those that it does have go into the IIvx and Performa
  600.

Subj:   My brother sent me the following tidbit from the net

In article &lt;1992Jul18.001028.13917@husc3.harvard.edu&gt; someone writes:
&gt;Having deeply lamented the low critical standard of the recent
&gt;deconstruction debate, I offer to my faithful readers an exegesis of the
&gt;following delectable morsel.  In keeping with my opportunistic nature, I
&gt;shall help myself to the techniques of numerous warring schools of
&gt;postmodern textual analysis, without swearing allegiance to any of them.

&gt;In article &lt;1992Jul17.092211.1@happy.colorado.edu&gt;
&gt;rccompono@happy.colorado.edu writes:

&gt;&gt;Well, after a year reading this newsgroup I've finally gotten thoroughly
&gt;&gt;pissed off (yeah, I know, who cares).

&gt;The lapidary style of the preamble strikes this implied reader as a ton of
&gt;bricks.  In one fell swoop, the text is rooted in the temporal ("after a
&gt;year") quagmire of the ubiquitous human condition ("newsgroup"), and
&gt;tragically enmired in the mundane morass of functional corporeality (cf.
&gt;the earthy _jeu d'esprit_ implicit in the complement "thoroughly pissed
&gt;off"); the tragic alienation of the postmodern hero explodes in the final,
&gt;tragically ironic parenthetic aside ("(yeah, I know, who cares)").  The
&gt;delicate, Socratic quality of this magnificent finale inheres in its finely
&gt;nuanced tension between an expressed awareness of the irremediability of
&gt;all human condition, and an implied hope for ultimate eschatological
&gt;deliverance therefrom.

&gt;&gt;Mr. Zeleny,

&gt;The vocative, with its brusquely formal manner, catches the implied reader
&gt;unawares.  "Am I perchance transgressing the social norms of privacy in
&gt;personal communication?"  But no, -- this is but a trapdoor designed to
&gt;separate those naive relics of phallogocentrism, who still cling to the
&gt;discredited doctrine of textual intentionality.  The postmodern reader
&gt;distinguishes hirself by skilfully avoiding this trap, in immediately
&gt;realizing that, -- "Mr.  Zeleny" -- c'est nous.

&gt;&gt;  You are

&gt;The "problematic" (the ascii limitations prohibit this writer from placing
&gt;a term _sous rature_) status of the copula ("are") is known to all readers
&gt;of the divine Jacques Derrida.  The ludic impulse of the text transcends
&gt;the banal bonds of the commonsense notion of the unitary self, encompassing
&gt;all of the teeming, multicultural humanity in ostensibly playing along with
&gt;the conventional English language-game (cf. Ludwig Wittgenstein's
&gt;_Philosophische Untersuchungen_) of multiplying the number of the
&gt;second-person pronoun ("You").

&gt;&gt;         an insufferable a2h2e

&gt;The carnivalesque (cf. Mikhail Bakhtin) element introduced by the canny
&gt;synecdochic use of the noun ("a2h2e"), the vernacular name of the
&gt;paradigmatically "low" body part standing in for the implied narratee, who,
&gt;as we already discovered, stands antonomastically for *all of us*, is
&gt;tempered by the tragic note sounded by the priggishly pedantic adjective
&gt;("insufferable").  Yet, upon scrutinizing the latter, we discover the deep
&gt;structure (apologies to Noam Chomsky) of a _portmanteau_ word: in the midst
&gt;of an archaism "inable" (vacillating, as it were between its empowering
&gt;modern verbal form, "enable", and the opposing adjectival impotence of
&gt;"unable"), boldly stands out the Dostoievskian imperative: "suffer"!  Thus
&gt;the moral dimension of Christian duty implicit in the illocutionary force
&gt;of the eternal dictum traverses the chasm between tyrannical force and
&gt;pathetic, yet all-too-human incapacity.

&gt;&gt;                                 and people like you are

&gt;Here, once again, we find a supererogatory hint of universality, already
&gt;evident in the preceding material.  Overdetermination is the name of the
&gt;game! (Cf. Sigmund Freud's _Traumdeutung_)

&gt;&gt;                                                         one of the major
&gt;&gt;reasons the U.S. is as f2ked up as it is.

&gt;A commendable manifestation of emerging social consciousness (cf. anything
&gt;by Walter Benjamin or Frederick Jameson).

&gt;&gt;                                          Please get f2ked with a chainsaw
&gt;&gt;and die.

&gt;We have reached the climactic point of this decidedly non-Aristotelian
&gt;opus.  The masterly imperative construction in the passive voice evinces
&gt;the quintessentially Barthesian (cf. _S/Z_) device of _suspension_, whereby
&gt;the banal, reactionary question of the traditional literary critic: _"Qui
&gt;parle?"_ falls on the barren ground of the arid postmodern _topos_.  This
&gt;_cri de coeur_ of an alienated, masterless (cf. Hegel, as read by Alexandre
&gt;Kojeve, in the course notes by Raymond Queneau) contemporary subjectivity
&gt;transcends the diabolical ejaculations of Maldoror by melding the morbid
&gt;music of the popular (cf. Stephen King and Tobe Hooper) thanatotropic
&gt;figure of technology run amok, with the eternal zoophilic resurgence of
&gt;Eros triumphant.  Here we have, condensed in an electronic nutshell of the
&gt;impersonal glow of a computer screen, the timeless recipe of death and
&gt;transfiguration, ever so aptly expressed in the pithy, chiseled idiom of
&gt;the disaffected, inarticulate American lower middle class.
