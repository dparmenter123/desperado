In case you missed it in last week's paper, Lee Iacocca doesn't want
to run for President (of the U.S., that is), but said that if he did,
his ideal running mate would be sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

"I'd tell everybody what to do and she'd tell everybody how," he said."

Subj:   Jokes

That "IBM" joke told by Ken in today's Desperado is actually
a Dec joke that goes something like this.

On her wedding night, the bride said to her husband "Please be
gentle with me, I'm a virgin."

"But how can that be, since you've been married four times
already?"

"Well, my first husband was a Dec Marketing Manager who kept
telling me how good it would be.

"And my second husband was a Dec Salesman who couldn't understand
why the delivery was late.

"My third husband was a Dec programmer who said he had to
just had to get the bugs out first.

"And my last husband was a Dec field-service engineer who
always said 'Don't worry darling, it'll be up in 10 minutes.'"

Subj:   colors

It seems that colors can be divided into three classes.

Colors of class 1: Grey, Brown, Black, White, Green

Colors of class 2: Red, Violet, Pink

Colors of class 3: Orange, Yellow, Blue, Indigo, Mauve, Beige, Purple...

What is the criterion for selection?

Answer: The colors in the first class find use as family names, those in
the second class find use in first names (Christian names? Saint Pinky?),
and those in the third class are not often used for either purpose.

(Orange and Violette and Blue are occasionally used as family names, and
Red is used in compounds such as Redfern and Redman.)

But why? Maybe only neutral colors get used for Class 1? But green at least
does not fit. Maybe class 1 is only hair and eye colors? Red, orange,
and blue ought to be more common in that case?

Is there something interesting about the sources of these names, or were
some families decimated years ago? Are there similar or different
selections for names in other languages?

Subj:   The "Prof. Schmidt from MIT" scam"

April 8th I got a call out of the blue from a Michelle Gardner
who said she worked for a Prof. Johnathan Schmidt at MIT.
The gist of the call was that Prof. Schmidt was putting together
a seminar series on a whole raft of topics - cluster systems
design and architecture, VIA, communications between systems
and other related topics.  He needed people who would be willing
to look over some material and give him feedback to see if
he was going in the right direction.  This could lead to people
being guest speakers at his seminars or members of a panel
discussion.

Michelle said she or Prof. Schmidt can be reached at MIT at
(617) 253-1000 extension 8600 (the Comp. Sci. department).
Michelle said she'd call me back later in the week to see
if I'd come up with anyone, but I told her I'd give them her
number instead.

When I got back today I had a mail message from one of the people
I'd contacted saying they'd had trouble reaching Michelle at MIT.
Since other folks in my group mentioned that they had received the
same call I had, but I was the only one with a number to return the
call, I called MIT to check up on Prof. Schmidt and Michelle Gardner.
I ran into some problems.  The MIT records office didn't have any Prof
by that name, and Michelle Gardner wasn't in their listings.  The
extension was bogus, too.  MIT seemed to think that it was a frequent
occurrance that people use their name in order to gain information.
Rest assured that I didn't give "Michelle" any information or names"
- I hope that noone else did either.

Subj:   Royal Music

Once upon a time, there was a noble king. This king had a minstrel who
played the lute beautifully, and whose voice was no end of delight to the
king. The king, however, knew that the minstrel was growing old and would
not be able to provide him with music for too many more years, so the king
called the minstrel in one day and said that he should begin to look for
an apprentice. The minstrel said he would begin his search without delay,
and went out into the countryside to find a likely young lad to fill
the position.

For months on end the old minstrel searched to no avail. Through hill and
dale, town and field he looked, but nowhere could he find a boy who showed
any promise as a musician. Finally, in despair, he returned to the capital
city, and after a night of soul searching and much ale, stumbled out of his
favorite tavern and began his long trek back to the castle. With his head
muddled with a few too many mugs, he lost his way and wandered into the
poorest district of town.

As he was passing a tiny, dilapidated house, he heard the most beautiful
voice singing one of the king's favorite songs. The minstrel was transfixed
by the voice, and finally realized that here was what he sought. After
realizing that the voice was coming from the hovel that he was standing in
front of, he approached, and knocked on the door.

After a moment or two, a young girl answered the door, and upon requesting
to see the owner of the beautiful voice he had just heard, the minstrel was
told that it was her who had been singing.

The minstrel was crestfallen, for he was faced with a terrible dilema, for
apprentice minstrels were traditionally boys. However, having found no other
likely candidates for the apprenticeship, he offered it to the girl, who
readily accepted.

When the king heard of this break with tradition, he called the minstrel to
him and expressed his concern. The minstrel assured him that he had had no
other choice, as he had been unable to find any suitable male candidates.
The minstrel then reassured the king that all was well, that the apprentice's
training was going apace, and that the student had proven herself to be
a very apt pupil. The king's concerns thus were soothed, and he gave the
minstrel his blessing.

After many months of training, the apprentice was deemed ready to assume
full duties as the court minstrel, so the old minstrel announced his
impending retirement and succession by his pupil. The king decreed that a
great feast should be held in honor of the transfer of duties and to
commemorate the many years of pleasant music the old minstrel had provided
in the service of the king.

As the day of the great feast approached, the apprentice could be seen to
become increasingly aggitated, and on the evening of the celebration was
a nervous wreck. When, in the midst of the feast, the king asked that the
minstrel-to-be sing a song for the members of the court, the young lass
stood, took up her lute, and proceeded to create a horrible din, as
her state of nervousness would not permit her to concentrate on her singing
or playing.

The king was, not surprisingly, disturbed and called the minstrel aside.

"Pray, why does thy pupil assault mine ears thus?" the king asked. "By thy
account she had a wonderous voice and prodigious skill with the lute."

"Aye, she do at that, sire," replied the old minstrel. "And by the morrow,
when she's the court minstrel official, she'll be singing like the larks
again, I warrant."

"Pray tell, why then does she screech like a banshee tonight?" asked the king.

"Oh, never you mind that, sire," replied the minstrel. "She just be
suffering from pre-minstrel tension."

Subj:   How do you play a record backwards?

From the Globe last week:

          IRONTON, Ohio (AP) - Church members
          singing "Oh, How I Love Jesus" burned
          record albums, cassettes and other
          rock and country music paraphernalia
          after attending a seminar in which
          an evangelist said the "Mr. Ed"
          television theme conveys a satanic
          message to unwary listeners.
             About 75 teen-agers attended the
          record burning after the Tuesday
          night seminar.
             Jim Brown, an evangelist in South
          Point, said the Mr. Ed theme extols
          Satan when the record is played
          backwards.
             "A Horse is a Horse," contains
          the backward messages "the source
          is Satan" and "someone sang this
          song for Satan," Brown said during
          the seminar at the First Church of
          the Nazarene in Ironton.

just plain easier:  since "he" has been the style for several
centuries now -- and since it really includes everybody, anyway,
right? -- it seems only fair to give "she" a turn... And don't
be upset by the business letter that begins "Dear Madam," fellas.
It means you too.
                -- Lindsy van Gelder, Ms., 1980 [Ah, whatever happened
                   to that debate and the proposals for a new 3rd person
                   singular pronoun?]

Unlike the male codfish, which, suddenly finding itself the parent
of three and a half million little codfish, cheerfully resolves
to love them all, the British aristocracy is apt to look with a
somehat jaundiced eye on its younger sons.

Subj:   The Mrs. Field's Myth

Desperado is circulating a myth about the Mrs. Field's cookie recipe
being sold for a extortionist price.  I know it's a myth cuz I read an
editorial in People Magazine and the Denver Post about it, and everyone
knows that those media don't lie.

Circulate the myth if you want, but make these corrections:

When the woman called about getting the recipe she was told it would
cost her "Two-fifty".  Wretched imbecile that she was, she thought they
meant $2.50--not $250.00.

Now really, why would Mrs. Field (a very pretty 29 year old who operates
out of Park City, Utah) sell a recipe that has made her millions for
$250.00, let alone $2.50?  Her cookies are VERY good; they're so good,
people pay for them by the pound.  I bought two over the weekend and
paid $1.65 for them--and they were no bigger than two Chips Ahoy
cookies.

Can you imagine the Colonel giving away his
recipe for fried chicken (which isn't fried at all--it's cooked in a
pressure cooker, as I understand it).

The "Kentucky Fried Rat" story, by the way, was also a myth.

So's the one about the Doberman Pinscher choking on a severed hand, but
the implementation doesn't matter, the point is the cookie recipe. And if
people think that chocolate is the way to go, they're welcome to it. They can,
as P.G. Wodehouse might remark, lap it up til their eyes bubble. Me, I go for
something with character, and much against my better judgement, offer the
following:

                       La Desperada's Carrot Cookies

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cream:
    1/2 cup butter (unsalted if you think of it)
Add and cream well:
    1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
    1/2 cup granulated sugar
Combine and beat in until smooth:
    1 egg
    1 teaspoon vanilla
    1 tablespoon milk
Sift together and add to the above ingredients:
    1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
    1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
When beaten smooth add:
    1 cup uncooked quick rolled oats
    1/2 cup coconut
    1/2 cup raisins, soaked in hot water for 15 minutes
        (golden raisins are best)
    1/2 cup chopped pecans
    1 1/2 cups grated carrots
Beat the mixture well. Drop cookies 2 inches apart on an ungreased
cookie sheet and bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
