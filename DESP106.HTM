                        WELL! WELL!  WELL!
                        WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

I guess I needed a vacation.  They changed the mail system on me.  My
Pro has been down.  I haven't been able to make terminal emulation
work on Micro/RSX.  I've been trapped on KRAPTON:: until recently.
And I've been trying to straighten out my new project.  That's the
story.  I am now working to catch up on Mail-22 (my witty fingers
typed that in place of Mail-11 once and I've been using the gag ever
since) and catch up on all my back mail.  Thanks for all the sympathy
and all the sarcastic remarks.  Keep those sharks and nettles coming
in.  More soon.

Best to everyone,

Tom Parmenter
