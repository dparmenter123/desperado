        I've been studying Spanish.  The Spanish word for "ballpoint pen"
        is "el boligrafo", but the Mexican word is "la pluma atomica".

        (Back in 1958, when Newsweek was a ninth-rate publication instead
        of the proud fourth-rater that it is today, they published a cover
        story on the space program for which the cover photograph was a
        blow-up of the tip of a ball-point pen.)

        I was astonished to learn, by the way, that the tony Florida
        resort's name translates to "mouse mouth" rather than "rat mouth"
        as I had so long believed.

        Silver lining:  One of the unexpected consequences of the AIDS
        epidemic is that it is unheard of to have a medical conference on
        the disease without AIDS patients being represented.  This is due
        to the perspicacity and energy of the patients themsleve, and not
        from any medical invitation received by them.  And, if that were
        not amazing enough, AIDS patients are also working to see that the
        same thing happens in other fields of disease research.  All this
        from people who are physically weak and certainly have other things
        to think about.

        Last night on TV there was a breakthrough in 900 numbers, call and
        get your Tarot read.  And, No!  It's not a recording.  Your Tarot
        will be read by an "authentic psychic astrologer".  Yeah, and if I
        call one of those lonely-hearts lines I'll get to talk to an
        authentic semi-beautiful girl with deeply-encarmined Jaggeresque
        lips who wants to tell me her secrets.  (Sandra Bernhard with no
        brains?)

        I'm not curious enough (in either sense of the word "curious") to
        actually call one, but what in the world could they be talking
        about?  We have recorded and live editions of:

                - phone sex sorted by acceptable combinations and
                  apparently by rankness as well.

                - chat lines, which are apparently different from

                - phone loneliness, singles of both sexes, singles of the
                  girl sex, models.

                - celebrities.

                - purely commercial propositions like the "polls" on
                  CNN and the "requests" on MTV.

        I wish I could think of an idea for a 900 line, but it seems to
        call for a certain tediosity of mind to imagine that anyone would
        pay money to hear the latest Jose Canseco news or Jessica Hahn's
        last remaining secrets.  The markup on these things has got to be
        incredible.  Some of them brag that calls are *only* $10 or only
        $25.

        Another bright 900 idea executed this week:  Call Frank Sinatra
        and wish him a happy birthday.  But he never calls me.

        On the other hand, I might pay a dollar to hear what Jim Bakker has
        to say about Jessie now that she's been surgically tarted up and
        gotten all that hair.

        Maybe Henry Kissinger should do a 900 line.  Or share one with
        Jessica?

Yes, Leslie's cake mix was distributed by Desperado in March 1983, and we
had it first.

Incidentally, in the course of this research I discovered that the first
mailing ever in the stream that grew up to be Desperado was in July 1980,
so we missed the 10th anniversary. or we had it and didn't celebrate it, or
something.  Do I hear 11?

Subj:   State Songs

Okay, so now we know about "Yankee Doodle", can someone tell us about the
New Jersey state song?  I believe it's titled "The New Jersey Loyalty Song,"
though none of my native New Jerseyan friends seem loyal enough to have
ever heard it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Dunno nothing about it, but I noticed the other day that New Jersey has
vanity license plates for Penn State Alums with a little embossed bear or
nitany lion or whatever their totem is.  So what kind of New Jersey loyalty
is that?

Subj:   A point of fact...

Connecticut was actually the second state to ratify the Constitution.  The
final state to do so was the state with the longest (official) name...

"The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations"

To misquote Richard Armour,

"Roger Williams founded Rhode Island, which is so small that it is usually
indicated by 'R.I.' on the map.  It used to be densely wooded; now it is
densely populated."

Rhode Island's reputation was as 'The home of the otherwise-minded;' it is
still the only state in the Union to celebrate V-J day, which it recently,
in order not to offend any Japanese-Americans, renamed Victory Day.  Many
WWII veterans were terribly offended at this change.  The people of the
state  also have a reputation for being rude, which I have not found to be
true; although there are rude people in Rhode Island, I don't think that
the average number of rude persons per 10000 is any higher than Boston or
downstate New York.

Chuck Stern

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations once offended the
easily offended Col. Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune.
Col. McCormick was one of these flag-worshipers.  A color cut of Old Glory
appeared on both sides of his paper's masthead and furthermore the paper
ran a front-page picture every day of some plant or school flying its flag.
Nonetheless, the good Col. cut "Rhode Island's star" out of the Tribune's
flag and flew the mutilated flag as a political protest for some
considerable period of time.  (Actually, in the spirit of union and so
forth, there are as many stars as there are states (and commonwealths), but
the individual stars aren't allocated to the indivudual states.)

More on "the flag issue".  Country songsmith Tom T. Hall has recorded a song
called (approximately) "You can't burn my flag".  The theme seems to be
that you can burn all the pieces of cloth you want, you unamerican
pig-fondler, but you won't affect the flag I carry in my heart as an image
of liberty.  Not bad for a hillbilly, eh?

Subj:   from "The Realist"

Sunday, on my usual library&amp;bookstore&amp;espresso fix trip, I picked up
a copy of "The Realist".  I was interrupted at one point by someone who
wanted to know what I was reading and if he could have it when I was
done.  I guess I was giggling too much.  Here's a couple of selections:

An excerpt from the middle of Robert Anton Wilson's column
"Is Alan Cranston Full of S*it", dealing with the proposed
FCC ban on "indecent" speech on radio and tv, and the senator's
form response letter to one of Wilson's:

        I suddenly remembered the immortal interview with musician
        Bob Geldof published in the _Irish_Times_ when I was living
        in Ireland.  The reporter asked if his use of "improper
        language" did not detract from the humanitarian causes
        for which he has worked so hard and long.

        "I don't know what the *uck improper language is," Geldof
        replied.  I only read this and wasn't at the interview,
        but I've always been able to hear it, in my head, delivered
        in his inner-city Dublin brogue: "I don't knah wot the fook
        improper language is."

        Then I recalled some remarks by the eminent philosopher
        George Carlin (himself once the subject of FCC censorship).
        Carlin, in his latest tour, has been doing a routine about
        the three most dangerous groups in America.  He says these
        groups are: first, the stupid, who make up the majority.
        (You all know how dumb the average guy is, right?  Well,
        mathematically, by definition, half of them are even dumber
        than _that_.)  Second, there is the group made up of people
        who are full of shi*, such as used car salespeople and
        baseball stars (who will do a 30-second commercial endorsing
        anything, including leper's dung for breakfast, if they get
        paid a million dollars).  Third, there is the vast army of
        those who are totally fuck*ng crazy.  It is because of the
        influence of these three groups, Carlin says, that we know
        have a Vice President who is stupid, full of sh*t and totally
        f*cking crasy, all at once.

One of last week's Globes carried the following story in two different
places, which was good, because I couldn't get enough of it, myself:

A Norwegian fella moved from the country to an apartment in Oslo.  His
first day in the new digs, he took a break from unpacking and stepped
out for dinner.  On the way back home, he realized he had no idea
where home was.

He took out an ad in the newspaper, complete with his picture, hoping
his landlady would recognize him and get in touch.  It's been a month,
and he's heard nothing, during which time he's been paying to stay at
the hotel after paying a month in advance on the phantom apartment.

"I should have written down the address before I went out," he told
reporters ruefully.

&gt;From "The Economist"
p 104, v 6 # 12, Oct 1990

C = }&gt;;{))

Last month this newspaper described some of the purported hazards of
working with computers -- electro-magnetic radiation, strained limbs,
strained eyes. We neglected to mention crooked heads. That is what you
get from trying to read the expressions of a new hieroglyphic language
that computer addicts have invented to enliven messages.

Like prehistoric cave dwellers, the devotees of electronic
bulletin-boards and "e-mail" have struggled to find a new way to
express themselves. Wall painting would not work. Words, it seems, are
not enough. Inarticulate sounds cannot be displayed on screens.  To
make their messages feel more like personal contact, they have hit on
using the punctuation marks on an ordinaty keyboard in order to pull
faces at each other. To read these signs, you have to put your head on
your left shoulder.

The basic unit is:
                                 :-)

the "smiley", a standard smiling face. In context, this can mean "I'm
happy to hear from you", or other pleasantries.  The smiley can also
wink:
                                 ;-)
or frown:
                                 :-(

among other things. The language can express many things about the
user's appearance:

                8-)   :-{)   8:-)   :-)-8   :-Q   @:-)

These signs mean, respectively, that the user wears sunglasses, has a
moustache, is a little girl, is a big girl, smokes, wears a turban.

The smiley can also indicate some subtleties of mood and response:

                     :-D   :-/   :-e   :-7   :-X

These mean that he is laughing, is sceptical, is disappointed, is wry,
is keeping his lips sealed.

Many of the signs (perhaps the majority in use on America's biggest
computer networks) are simply absurd fun, verging on the
unintelligible:

                       :-F   *:o)   +-:-)   @=

The user is a buck-toothed vampire with one tooth missing, is a clown,
holds religious office, is pro-nuclear. The hieroglyph of our title
means that the user is a drunk, devilish chef with a toupee in an
updraft, a moustache and a double chin.  Now you know what electronic
mail is used for.

            Dimensional Foods Corp in Boston has developed a way to
            craft brightly colored holograms on such dietary delights
            as breakfast cereal and candy. Conventional holograms are
            generated by bouncing laser beams off objects and
            reproducing the reflected light with foils or emulsions.
            Dimensional Foods uses photosensitive films to fabricate
            molds that, when stamped into food, create patterns of
            microscopic ridges that produce holographic images when hit
            by ordinary light. The patented process, which the company
            plans to license to food and confectionery manufacturers,
            can add up $50,000 to the cost of production equipment. But
            Dimensional Foods officials are betting that the gimmick
            will more than pay off by attracting kids to lollipops and
            cereals stamped with holograms of their favorite cartoon
            characters.

    snowstorm and you're tailing an 18-wheeler.  Stop at any gas station
    that serves food.  When the waitress asks what you'd like order
    an upset stomach because that's probably what you'll get anyway.

    - Visit your local butcher and pay $30 to sit in his walk-in freezer
    for half an hour.  Afterward, burn two $50 bills to warm up.  It's
    not real skiing but it's close.

    - Fill a blender with ice, hit the pulse button and let the spray
    sandblast your face.  You'll almost believe you're skiing in front
    of a snowmaking gun.

    - Sit under a sun lamp wearing goggles to get that chic racoon look.

    - Where apres-ski boots everywhere - even in the shower.  For the
    best effect, get the boots that look like two dead Afghan hounds
    strapped to your calves.

    - At the nearest hockey rink, walk across the ice 20 times in your
    ski boots carrying two pairs of skis, loaded accessory bag and poles.
    Make believe you're looking for your car.

    - For ski-boot simulation at home, put a pebble in your street shoes
    and tighten a C-clamp around your toes.

    - Buy a pair of gloves and immediately throw one away.  This will
    save you from losing it later.

    - Go to a McDonald's and insist on paying $3.50 for a hamburger.
     Be sure to wait in the longest line.

    - Speaking of lines, stand in any movie line on the coldest day
    of the year.  Inch ahead with the crowd but don't go in.  Do this
    12 or 18 times.

    - To simulate losing a ski in deep powder, spend a lot of money
    to fly to a Caribbean resort.  When you arrive toss a Krugerrand
    onto the beach.  Then try to find it.

    - To simulate glade skiing take a jog through the woods - with your
    eyes closed.

    - Clip a lift ticket to the zipper of your jacket and ride a motorcycle
    fast enough to make the ticket lacerate your face.

    None of these activities is skiing, but all of them sure feel like
    it.

Subj:   Technophilia-induced problem at Educom?

Today's EDUCOM keynote speech, by former President Jimmy Carter was
open-captioned for the hearing impaired.  The big-video display in the
auditorium showed a textual representation of the speech as Carter spoke.
This was provided by "11-Alive," an Atlanta television station.

The system must have used some kind of voice-recognition algorithm, because
no human typist that I know could have kept up with the speaker at times.
The weakness of the voice-recognition system was made painfully obvious to
attendees, when those with the ability to hear the presentation noticed
substitutions like:

"man well" noriega, "wak dem iks" for academics, "oath yope yam" for
Ethiopia, "Jap neens" for Japanese, "My Robe by" N Nairobi for "Ken Yeah"
for Kenya, "Home Jean yes" for homogeneous.

Carter's speech was thoughtful and moving (he talked about academia's moral
responsibilities to the third world), but the seriousness of the speech was
undercut by the occasional giggle from the audience.

Later in the speech, human control seemed to be asserted a bit more, and
"another country" was frequently substituted for the name of a third-world
country, but Carter must have been most puzzled when he explained that the
Carter Foundation was nonpartisan, and that "Prominent Republicans" worked
closely with him on every major project.  It was presented to the
hearing-impaired (and to the rest of us) as "Prominent Rubble Cans."  Of
course, the audience broke into laughter, and I suspect he still doesn't
know why.

I'm a strong supporter for appropriate adaptive technology, but a low-tech
solution (an ASL interpreter) would have been less distracting and reached
many (though not all) of the hearing-impaired.

                        TECH TIP - Electricity

1. Most electricity is manufactured in power stations, where it is fed into
wires which are then wound around large drums.

2. Some electricity, however, does not need to go along wires. That used in
lightning, for example, and in portable radios. This kind of electricity
was manufactured long ago, and was left just laying around loose, so be
careful.

3. Electricity makes a low humming sound. This noise may be pitched at
different levels for use in doorbells, telephones, and electric organs.

4. Electricity has to be grounded. That is to say it has to be connected to
the ground before it can function, except in the case of airplanes, which
have separate arrangements.

5. Although electricity does not leap out of an empty light socket, that
socket is nevertheless live, if you happen to stick your finger in it when
the switch is on. So, if it is not leaking, what else is it doing?

6. Electricity  is made up of two ingredients, negative and positive. One
ingredient travels along a wire covered with black plastic, and the other
along a wire covered with white plastic. When these two wires meet together
in what we call a plug, the different ingredients are mixed together to
form electricity.

7. Electricity may be stored in batteries. Big batteries do not necessarily
hold more electricity than small batteries. In big batteries, the
electricity is just shoveled in, while in small batteries (for walkmen
etc.) it is packed in flat.  Since electricity is invisible, you can't tell
whether a battery is  full just by looking at it.  If you turn a battery
upside down to find out how   much electricity is inside, you may not be
able to pick it all up when it falls  out.

8. Most engineers believe there are two kinds of electricity, called AC and
DC. This has never been proved very well, because the evidence is usually
destroyed when you try to experiment replacing one with the other.  Some
engineers claim you can actually taste the difference, but those guys are
mostly brain-dead.

    By the way, what's the origin of the phrase "dead heat"?  I suppose
    it's from horse racing but that doesn't really explain it...

One dictionary (Webster's Ninth) gives 1840 as the year of first
appearance of this phrase in writing.  There are two parts to this: the
use of "heat" to mean race, and the use of "dead" to mean tied.

Perhaps the use of "heat" to mean race is just from the obvious
association of exertion with heat, but I really don't know.

I'm pretty sure that "dead heat" comes from "deadlock," which supposedly
first appeared in writing in 1779.  So where did "deadlock" come from?
Well, the "lock" part seems pretty obvious, as in "locked in an
embrace."  The "dead" part must refer to the inability of either side to
move that is characteristic of a deadlock.  The extension of "deadlock"
to "dead heat" conjures up an image of two brawlers rolling over each
other to the finish line.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, um, guys, there is *nothing* mysterious about "deadlock".  It's just
a kind of lock, the  kind that requires parties on both sides of the door
to unlock it before it will open.  The door between two hotel rooms is
usually controlled with a deadlock.

Dead reckoning, by the way, has nothing to do with death, but is merely the
abbreviation for deduced reckoning, that is, ded. reckoning.

Nigerians fear dismembering as tales of genital theft grow

Agence France-Presse

LAGOS - A bizarre rumor of disappearing male genitals has gripped
black Africa's biggest city, leading to mob attacks in Lagos on
suspected organ-robbers and extensive coverage in Nigeria's news
media.

   The rumor, whose origins are unclear, states that some
unscrupulous people use bodily contacts such as handshakes to make
genitals disappear.

   According to the rumor, the stolen organs later reappear in
possession of these people, who sell them for thousands of dollars.

   Dozens of suspects have been beaten up by irate mobs or
arrested by policemen in various parts of this city of an
estimated seven million residents in the past two weeks.

   Many Lagos residents now go about the streets checking from
time to time their genitals immediately after a handshake or after
a bodily contact with a stranger.

   Reacting to the rumor, the Lagos state police issued an
official statement last Thursday.  It described the rumor as the
work of mischievous elements who create a panicky situation to
enable them to loot, steal or commit other atrocities against
innocent citizens.

   Beside bodily contact, the rumor says, another method used by
the "evildoers" involves asking their victim for the time of day
or for directions.

   "Once they succeed in arresting their attention, the genitals
vanish immediately," a firm believer in the rumor said.

   Because bodily contacts are impossible to avoid at such crowded
spots as bus stops and markets, that is where the popular fears
most often crystallize into mass violence.

From: ewa@cs.UCSD.EDU (Eric Anderson)
&gt;From tonight's Tribune:

NIGERIAN police arrested 150 people in Lagos for spreading rumors
that sorcerers have been stealing men's genitals.  After the
rumors swept the West African capital, mobs killed at least three
people accused of stealing the organs.  According to the rumors,
sorcerers approached strangers and asked them for directions.
Later, the victims reportedly said their genitals were missing.
Police dismissed the reports after investigators examined the
supposed victims.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
&gt;From time to time, various locations in China are afflicted with epidemics
of genital shrinkage, which is combatted by affixing weights to the
affected member.  A particularized expression of generalized  anxiety, much
like the Mattoon Gasser, except the participants here are men (obviously),
whereas the Gasser preyed on the young women of Mattoon, Illinois, circa
1943.

In Mexico recently there have been news accounts, including official
nondenials, of children being stolen to be slaughtered for their organs to
feed the American transplant industry.

The urban legend comes to life.

Conservative Member of Parliament Geoffrey Dickens tells of attending a fair

ugly woman whom he couldn't get rid of.

A few days later he got an admiring letter from her asking for his

Dickens was touched by her humorous modesty and sent off a picture
autographed, "To Horseface, with best wishes, Geoffrey Dickens."

Some time later his secretary asked him, "Did you get that letter from the

Subject: This is a design specification?

My boss gave me this to read after getting a particularly fuzzy user
specification for a system change.  There is no author attribution or
source noted.  It was just a photocopy...

Dear Mr. Architect,

Please design and build me a house.  I am not quite sure of what I need,
so you should use your discretion.

My house should have between two and forty-five bedrooms.  Just make
sure the plans are such that bedrooms can be easily added or deleted.
When you bring the blueprints to me, I will make the final decision of
what I want.  Also bring me the cost breakdown for each configuration so
that I can arbitrarily pick one.

Keep in mind that the house I ultimately chose must cost less than the
one I am currently living in.  Make sure, however, that you correct all
the deficiencies that currently exist in my house (the floor of my
kitchen vibrates when I walk across it, and the walls don't have nearly
enough insulation in them).

Also keep in mind as you design this house that I wish to keep yearly
maintenance cost as low as possible.  This should mean the incorporation
of extra-cost features like aluminum or vinyl siding.  If you chose not
to specify aluminum, be prepared to explain in detail.

Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials
are used in construction of the house.  The house should be really nice.
However, be alerted that the kitchen should be designed to accommodate
among other things, my 1952 Gibson refrigerator.

To assure that you are building the correct house for our family, make
sure that you contact each of the children and also the in-laws.  My
mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house ought
to be designed since she visits with us at least once a year.  Make sure
that you weigh all these options carefully and make the right decision.
I, however, retain the right to override any decision you come up with.

Please don't bother me with small details right now.  Your job is to
develop the overall plans for this house.  Get the big picture.  It is
not appropriate at this time to be choosing the color of the carpet.
However, keep in mind that my wife likes green.

Also do not worry at this time about acquiring resources to build this
house.  Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and
specifications.  However, once I accept these plans, I will expect to
have the house under roof within 48 hours.

While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind
that sooner or later I will have to sell this house.  It should have
appeal to potential buyers.  Please make sure that before you finalize
the plans, there is a consensus of the population in my area that they
like the features this house has.

You are advised to run up and look at my neighbor's house he had
constructed last year.  We like it a great deal.  It has many features
that we would like to have in our new home, particularly the 75-foot
swimming pool.  With careful engineering I believe that you can design
this into our new house without impacting the construction cost.

Please prepare a complete set of blueprints.  It is not necessary at
this time to do the real design since these blueprints will be used only
for construction bids.  Please be advised however, that any increase of
cost in the future as a result of design changes will result in you
getting your hands slapped.

You must be thrilled to be working on such an interesting project such
as this.  To be able to use new kinds of construction and to be given
such freedom in your designs is something that doesn't happen very
often.  Contact me as rapidly as possible with your design ideas.
I am enthusiastic about seeing what you can come up with.

P.S.  My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many on the
      instructions I've given you in this letter.  As architect it is
      your responsibility to resolve these issues.  I have tried in the
      past and have been unable to accomplish this.  If you can't handle
      this, I'll have to look for a new architect.

P.P.S.  Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel trailer.
        Please  advise me as early as possible if that is the case.
