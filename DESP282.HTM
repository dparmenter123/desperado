               SO WHAT'S A GOOGOL TO THE GOOGOLTH THEN?

        I'M LOOKING FOR INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION FROM SOME GOOGOLMEISTER

He's right.  A googoleplex is "one with a googol zeroes following it".

While I may not be a googolmeister, I do recall, now that the subject
has come up for discussion, that another definition of the googolplex
is a 1 followed by a googol of zeros, which is consistent with Mr.
Swanson's discussion (expressed, as all good algorithms should be, in
APL, that is 10 * 10 * 100).

Subject: A googolplex isn't so big ...

The thing about:

                  (10 ^ 100)
        (10 ^ 100)

is that although it looks huge, it is equal to

            102
          10
        10

which is only boringly bigger than a googolplex.  Likewise,

                         (10 ^ (10 ^ 100))
        (10 ^ (10 ^ 100))

equals

            100 + (10 ^ 100)
          10
        10

which seems a lot like

              100
            10
          10
        10

If you want really *big* numbers, consider the following.  (I heard
about this in college and for some reason have the name Anderson (sp?)
attached to it.)

7 * 5 = 7 + 7 + ... (5 times) = 35
7 ^ 5 = 7 * 7 * ... (5 times) = 16807

Now imagine a new operation # which is repeated exponentiation:

7 # 5 = 7 ^ 7 ^ ... (5 times) = something larger than a goolgolplex.

We could clearly define an infinite progression of operators which
were defined by repeated uses of "lower" operators.  We could call
addition Order 1, multiplication would be Order 2, exponentiation
would be Order 3, # would be Order 4, etc.  Now let us define:

        A(n) = n combined with itself n times using the Order n operator.

A(1) = 1
A(2) = 2 * 2 = 4
A(3) = 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3 ^ 27 = 7625597484987
A(4) = 4 # 4 # 4 # 4 = 4 # 4 # (4 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ 4)
                     = 4 # 4 # (4 ^ 4 ^ 256)
                     ~ 4 # 4 # (4 ^ (1.34 * 10 ^ 154))
                     ~ 4 # 4 # (10 ^ (8.07 * 10 ^ 153))
                     ~ 4 # (4 ^ 4 ^ ... (way more than a gogoolplex times))

This number is bigger than most people can imagine imagining.  And
then there is A (gazillion).  There is a part of me that finds it hard
to believe that these things are finite.  And then it is worth
remembering that these numbers are teenie compared to the really big
ones.

 Like most other humans, I can't imagine a number larger than six.
