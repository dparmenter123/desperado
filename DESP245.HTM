        Times were hard in Ballymuckmuck and young Mick like the brothers
        before him was forced to take the road across the water to look
        for work.

        We find him walking up Kilburn Highroad and spotting a building
        site with an important looking man in a suit with plans rolled up
        under his arm in conversation with a rough looking sort,  Mick
        walks up and inquires as to the liklihood of employment.

        He is greeted with derision and informed by the Architect, for it
        is he with the plans, that building these days is a high
        technology business with no room in it for ignorant bumpkins with
        strong backs.

        His companion, the charge hand, tugs at the Architect's sleeve and
        reminds him that they are a couple of men short.

        The Architect turns to our Mick and says, "Well, Paddy, I'll tell
        you what I'll do.  If you can tell me the difference between a
        Joist and a Girder then I'll hire you."  He winks to his
        companion.

        Mick answers slowly, trying to figure out what's the catch, "Well
        now, Joist, didn't he write Ulysses and The Dubliners, and Girder,
        didn't he write Faust and The Sorrows of Young Werther, one of the
        seminal novels of the 19th century romantic movement?  Jeasus,
        youse must be a thick crowd of hoors over here if you don't know

Subj:   re Deperado #3071 - Caribbean Synagogues and such

According to my sources, the synagogue on St. Thomas USVI is not the oldest
in the western hemisphere, but the oldest in continuous use on US territory.
Other sources cite the synagogue on Curacao (Netherlands Antilles) as the
"oldest in the New World", though one source cites the Barbados Synagogue
as the "oldest in the West".  Both of these synagogues have been rebuilt on
their original sites.

BTW, Truro Synagogue in Newport RI, which I believe is the oldest synagogue
in the continental US, was founded by a member of the Barbados Synagogue.

&gt;    My girlfriend can vibrate her eyeballs.  ...            It's eerie. Her

    I thought of this whilst watching _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ (the
    version with Donald Sutherland as the caper-seeking Health Inspector).
    His side-kick (I forget the actress' name, but she also played opposite
    Harrison Ford in _Raiders of the Lost Archive_) did this orb-wobbling
    trick on camera.  I've personally known one person who could do this,
    although I don't remember whom - actually, I may have known numerous
    people with this ability, but only one who actually admitted to it.

    My personal claim to fame in this causing-unusual-body-parts-to-emit-noise
    arena is pretty minimal; I can pop my right TMJ.  (Actually, I used to be
    able to do it at will; nowadays, I can't avoid it, since it happens every
    time I open my mouth.)  Of course, I can also cause my skull to crack by
    hitting it against something, but I don't do it very often.

Subj:   yet another self-ref haiku

Tom,

        To add to the set of self-explanatory haikus:

        Five syllables first,
        Seven syllables second,
        Five syllables third.

A friend invented this haiku back around 1977 in our high school English class
(the teacher was not visibly impressed).  It's stuck in my mind since then, so
it definitely works as a memory aid.  Admittedly it's about the most
un-haiku-like haiku I've ever seen:  totally utilitarian with no imagery or
twists at all, which perhaps makes it all the more interesting.  Who would
have thought one could say so little with so few words?  Normally haikus are
redolent with meaning or reflect a subtle psychological state; this one's state
is "lights on, nobody home".  Anyway, maybe if I keep talking I can convince
you that this is the best haiku ever written because of its being the worst...

By the way, if you enjoy seeing literary criticism being lampooned, check out
_The Pooh Perplex_ by Frederick Crews.  He parodies all sorts of lit-critters
by writing analyses of Winnie the Pooh in the style of various literary types,
including Marxists, Christians, and everyone in between.  It's a bit old, so
doesn't have the latest lit-crit fads.  Crews has been an outspoken critic of
deconstructionism, so I can only hope for another chapter in this form.  By
way of recommendation, a friend with a B.A. in English said this was one of
the two great books she read during her undergraduate years, the other being
James Joyce's _Ulysses_.

        Well, my source, the irascible nippophile Neil Keefe, states that
        while the Japanese word consists of three ideograms -- ha, i, and
        ku -- the actual pronunciation is two syllables.

                Haiku, ha-i-ku,
                Are ideograms like
                Syllables, or what?

Subj:   Interracial romances

In source files for the ULTRIX operating system, why do all of the copyright
notices name Digital?

&gt;        When I first hung out with beatniks in
&gt;        Chicago in 19-ought-and-fifty-nine there was a whole interracial
&gt;        couple scene going on there

Yup, in some parts of the U.S.A.  But those parts seem to have regressed
while other parts have advanced and/or stood still.  There is a generation
now that doesn't believe that some kinds of things might have been known
in 1959, whether it be ideas about human rights or portability of programming
languages and numerical computations.

For comparison, Japan seems to be improving very very slowly, but I wonder
how long that will last before regressing.  For example, my girlfriend almost
agreed to marry me but was afraid that her parents would cut her off for it
-- and I used to be friends with her parents.  For a second example, the
government (obviously controlled by older generations) will not even allow
another friend into the country for a short visit to see if she could stand
living here, in a tiny apartment with nothing to do outdoors and very few
English-speakers to talk with -- so we are now making arrangements to marry
by mail under Japanese law, and hope that she will be able to stand living
here, which should at least be allowed starting two months after marriage.

Looks like Chicago in 1959 had it easy.

I just saw a UPI news item about the discovery of a new breed of
ankylosaur (the kind with the clubs on the ends of their tails) near the
Tien Shan Mountains of China. The entertaining part is that the beastie
(which lived during the Jurassic period) was named in honor of the
upcoming Spielberg film based on the Crichton book "Jurassic Park". The
moniker:

        Jurassosaurus nedegoapeferkimorum

The article claims that the second name was derived from the first letters
of the last names of the actors who starred in the film. I wonder whether
the letters are in order of the actor's percentage of screen time, or if
they were pushed around solely in order to embed "go ape" in the middle.

Subject: [rec.humor.funny] Side Notes to a Deposition

From: jlee@smylex.UUCP (Jeff Lee)

Court reporting runs in my family; I came across this gem recently in
some of the old files.  My grandfather's brother, in the days before
computer-aided transcription (or even Steno machines), would dictate
his shorthand notes onto a reel-to-reel tape recorder, and sent the
tape to a typist.

One day, in a strange mood, he interrupted his notes to wax philosophic;
the typist, for some reason, kept his diatribe in the witness' testimony.
(Fortunately, the extraneous bit was removed before the final copy was
sent out of the office...)

Here it is (names have been changed):

                           -----O-----

Q  Now, would you tell the court in your own words concerning
   the general demeanor and actions of John Smith,
   which would throw any light on his competency, his mental
   competency?  Tell the court in your own words.

A  It is a long story, but if the court is willing, I will
   tell it.

Q  It will save my questioning you.  I think you are intelli-
   gent enough to tell the court what you know.

A  I knew very little about the family except that they
   lived next door and minded their own business.  I had no
   trouble with them.  They were quiet, the children were
   co-operative, they kept the children at home.  The elderly
   gentleman, Mr. Smith, we had very little association
   with him at first, but we had a big cat -- a very valuable
   cat, by the way -- that we had brought with us from Texas,
   and which was a show cat.  Mr. Smith had made friends
   with this cat, which was a difficult thing to do because
   the cat had been castrated when young and was not friendly.

     Operator, let us go off the record for a moment so that
   we may consider the last statement of the witness.

     At first blush I thought it was a perfect example of non
   sequitur, the jumping from an insufficient premise to a
   faulty conclusion.  It seemed to me that the witness'
   reasoning was wholly wrong:  that here should have been a
   placid cat; a happy, contented cat; a cat not subject to
   the storms and stresses of natural tomcathood; but one that
   could eat and sleep in the sunshine, and purr with no hate
   in his soul.  But the lady was qualified in psychiatry.  She
   was educated, and so I gave ear again to her words and
   another picture began to develop.  I noted that she did not
   state that this cat was a kitten when he suffered this
   great loss, but that he was young -- there's the difference.

     In my mind's eye, I see not a fuzzy, thoughtless kitten,
   but a young tomcat; a lusty, healthy young animal, one who
   is old enough to have forsaken the fireside for a night or
   two, one who had been on the tiles, so to speak, and who
   had roamed an alley or two in his day.  I see a cat
   developing into lusty tomhood, finding life good indeed.

     Then I see this catastrophe, this cataclysm, if I may say
   so, befall him.  I see him seized by a human, or two humans,
   and subjected to the greatest, basest indignity that could
   be inflicted upon cat or man.  I can picture the horrible
   scars upon his psyche, the agonized distortion of his very
   soul, as he tries unsuccessfully to adjust himself to his
   terrific loss.

     Ah, bad enough at his home in Texas, but then -- horror
   upon horrors -- he is wrenched away and brought to a
   strange city, a strange house, that in itself unbearable
   to cats.  I see him fighting another battle with humiliation
   and frustration, surrounded on all sides by his ancient
   enemy, Man, who had de-flowered him in his youth.

     And is that all?  No!  Where did his family take him?  Where
   did they force him to live?  NEXT DOOR TO A VETERINARY
   SURGEON!

     Yes, I agree.  I see here a cat with no cause to be friendly.
   I see a very bitter cat.

     Now, following the witness' statement out, I find that
   her reasoning is quite sound.  Here is this cat, bitter
   against Man, retired from the world, haunted and hagridden
   by his memories, ruined and betrayed by Man.  He sees Mr.
   John Smith and his lip curls in scorn and hatred.  He
   sees him again and again and one day a curious sensation
   comes to him.  He sees Mr. Smith pottering about the yard,
   while perchance the March breezes blow, the ladies passing
   down the street, their dresses pleasingly elevated by the
   wind.  It occurs to him Mr. Smith pays no attention to them,
   and he realizes in some dim, feline fashion that here, though
   he be a member of the tribe of his ancient enemy, is one in
   much the same condition as he.

     And so, hatred gives way to toleration, and toleration
   finally ripens into friendship.

     Operator, this bitter cat realizes that he and Mr. Garrett
   are brothers under the skin -- the foreskin, that is.

     Now back to the record.

Subject: Laser Printer Sucks up Cat

Danger from personal computers?  Most people think of electromagnetic fields
or getting zapped while monkeying around inside the box.  Nothing immediately
threatening could happen while just printing a spreadsheet.  Right?

That's what I thought until last week when my wife was severely bitten by our
kitten as it was hanging in mid-air by the tip of its tail.  It all started so
innocently.  Our 8-month-old kitten likes to lie on top of our Apple Personal
LaserWriter LS.  We have tried to get him off, but he keeps getting back up on
it.  He must like the hum.  My wife was printing a few pages in the
background.  While she was talking on the phone, there suddenly was a shriek
from the kitten.  The printer was only about 2 feet away from her, luckily
turned the opposite direction.  The kitten was sprawled stiff on top of the
printer, like he had been stuffed.  We just had him declawed, but his teeth
were grabbing at anything in sight, including my wife's arm as she tried to
turn off the printer.  The party on the other end of the phone thought that
both the kitten and my wife were being murdered.

After a few deep bites, the printer was off, but the tail was still stuck in
the top roller that ejects the paper from the printer.  Apparently, the hair
on the tip of his tail had gotten inside the roller and was sucked in as the
paper was being fed out.  While my wife was getting a towel to prevent further
injury, the kitten jumped off the side of the printer.  The top of the desk is
slightly waxed and the printer nearly slid off.  It would have landed on top
of him.  Can you imagine how hard it is to figure out how to open a printer
under these conditions?  Before she got the towel around him, the kitten took
a few more deep bites out of my wife's leg through her bluejeans!  After what
must have seemed like an eternity, my wife got the printer open and freed the
kitten.

A $27 trip to the vet informed us that we had a real lucky kitten.  If he had
been a little older and heavier, the tail would have separated and required
amputation.  If he still had claws, my wife would have had to have been
stitched back together.  What if it had been a child's long hair?

So Apple, how about a Kitty Guard?  Unfortunately, Cats don't read the generic
warnings that came with the printer.  I really like the quality and value of
the printer.  How much extra would I pay for more safety?  At least $27.  I
knew I was cutting corners when I bought the printer since it did not include
PostScript, but I really didn't expect this.

Several other companies also use the same type of printer case.  They all have
a max speed of 4 pages/minute and a cut-out in the top for the paper to
reverse stack or innocent kitties to take a nap.  Some have different paper
feed mechanisms, so the eject roller may also vary.

In case you were wondering, the kitten has been avoiding the printer the
last few days, but was seen standing on it once while it was off.

    The first issue of "Film Threat" I've seen since promising to pass
    along the address is also the best issue I've seen in years.  Maybe 20%
    of it is actually bearable, thanks mostly to the "Reservoir Dogs"
    coverage.

    Says writer/director Tarantino about the scene most likely to drive
    delicate technocrats out of the theater: "Michael can't believe that
    people are shocked by it because he has an L.A. point of view: that
    people are going to enjoy watching a cop get tortured. He can't believe
    that people don't like him after that scene.  He was talking to
    somebody, going, 'You're still having a good time with the character,
    right?  Because he's just torturing a cop!'"

    There's also an interesting-if-thin on-the-set report on Argento, a
    nice demure photo of Traci Lords, a couple of OK jokes, and the usual
    bunch of boring crap.

    Back issues for $4 each: Film Threat Back Issues, 9171 Wilshire Blvd.,
    Suite 300, Beverly Hills, CA 90210.  6 issue subscription, $11.85 to
    Film Threat, P.O. Box 16928, N. Hollywood, CA 91615.

    Even more recommendable is the first issue of "Asian Trash Cinema",
    containing tiny reviews of around 400 movies (probably a
    little less in my case since the printer left the two center pages
    blank).  An invaluable reference item.  Without it I might very well
    accidentally see "Kung Fu Zombie" when I really want to see "Kung Fu
    Wonder Child", or miss "Magic of Spell" ("a heroine chased by a giant
    boulder with teeth while an evil magician bathes in a pool of blood")
    altogether.  Of course I would never pass up a title like "Snake Girl
    Drops In" but after reading a paragraph like "Some incredible moments
    (eating a live frog, watering her hair in a men's room urinal) but
    mostly it's scantily clad snake girl against the evil gangsters" I'm
    _really_ psyched.

    Virtually the entire print run of the second issue was destroyed in the
    recent Florida hurricane, but the nice guy at "Naked Eye" said he'd
    lend me his copy when he's done with it.

    Both Asian Trash Cinema and European Trash Cinema are published by
    Craig Ledbetter, P.O. Box 5367, Kingwood, TX 77325.  Subscriptions $15
    for four issues.

Subj:   Bye to DEC after 9 years 3 months 3 days, and it's Christmas too!

The best thing about getting made redundant was the brevity of the affair.
I'd been away getting my three-yearly recertification for being a
First-Aider and got home on the Tuesday night to find a message to call my
manager. He then informed me that I was leaving DEC Friday.

I'd been pissed off for months, trying to get a real job. But since
there's no call for someone who knows VMS/ULTRIX &amp; DOS these days in a
group that wanted me to do Market Research into a developing a best in

the $%)^&amp;&amp;+(*&amp;^)($%^)&amp;)(_)_&amp;&amp;(&amp;((&amp;(&amp;((&amp;( \\\whoops, sorry, I just threw
up on the keyboard.

Anyhow, no call for my skills, so out the door I went, mostly happy to
have something definite to do - even if that was jobhunt.

A similarly treated colleague immediately started a contract for...DEC.
I'm a man of principle ( ie more expensive :-) ) and haven't worked again
yet, but I'm pretty happy to be typing up the CV, sending out one or two
a day and brushing up my C++ skills on my PC.

All this has given me time to reflect upon 9 years with DEC.....to sum
up: mostly harmless.

Anyhow, it's Christmas time again and I'm being dragged around the shops
by the kids (the wallet is the most painful part of my anatomy at
Christmas) and seeing all the new toys. Nintendo seem to have the "most
expensive starter toy" award with something costing more than 150 pounds.

My answer to a request for this was to walk away, laughing. This is
probably psychologically damaging for my kids, but, tough, I ain't made
of money and it's time the advertising / toy people got it into their
heads that this is a RECESSION fer chrissakes. 10 pounds is about what I
want to spend on any one thing for the kids, thanks. 150 quid apiece? 3
kids? see you in bankruptcy court, fellers......

Meantime, I'm shopping for a haircut and a suit, but figure that the
post-Christmas sales will take care of the latter and I've yet to grow up
enough to really do the former.

Seasonal Greetings to you (non-demoninational enough?)....and &lt;jym&gt;, drop
me a line if you still get desperado, since we plan to be in San
Francisco, Spring 1993.

IETFers; IABers; IESGers;

I do object to the proposed preference of content over style!

Yes, ASCII is searchable, but PostScript can handle more fonts.
How else can we profoundize ideas?

Our stand is substantiated by scientific data and by the research as
reported in the following.  This data proves for the first time, what
many suspected all along, that productivity in computer science is
directly linked to (quadratic, to be exact) both the number of printing
fonts and the printing resolution.

Unfortunately,  that report is not available in PostScript.

Based on this evidence I beg you to restore PostScript as the one and
only official binding version of any important publication.

=====================================================================

                       Productivity in Computer Science
                       --------------------------------

                               Prof. J. Finnegan
                         Oceanview University, Kansas
                             (on leave at USC/ISI)

     Productivity is the key to success from the individual level all
     the way up to the national level.

     There are many scientific techniques for measuring productivity.
     By using such objective measures, and by comparing the level of
     productivity from time to time the rate of progress may be
     determined.

     This report is based on a case study conducted in Oceanview, from
     which important lessons can be drawn for many other centers of
     Computer Science activities.

     This report offers, for the first time, a precise mathematical
     relation between productivity and several independent parameters
     such as bitmap resolution and communication bandwidth.

     The standard economic indicators and conventional statistics show
     that the general rate of progress in the United States is very
     low.  Detailed studies of the situation reveal that productivity
     is actually on a steady decline, particularly in relation to
     Japan.  Therefore, increasing productivity must be our top
     priority national goal.  This decline exists in all fields
     except, obviously, the legal industry.

     One area which still shows an uncharacteristic improvement in
     productivity is Computing.  This encouraging phenomenon is the
     subject of this short report.

     Computer scientists, like most other scientists, do not have a
     single strict objective measure for productivity.  There are
     several alternate methods to measure the productivity of the
     Computing field.  For example, the total number of patents
     granted (or applied for), papers published (or submitted),
     systems built (or talked about) or PhD degrees awarded (or
     sought).

     Until the middle of the century there was no productivity to
     speak of.  The little progress existing then was slow and in the
     wrong direction.  Until recently the Computer Science community,
     as a whole, has been working hard on finding remedies to the
     mistakes of that era.  The prestigious Anti-Von project is
     typical of that effort.

     Productivity did not improve significantly until terminals were
     installed for use by scientists.  Early systems of 50 and 75 baud
     pioneered the way for the First Generation of terminals, the 110
     baud TTYs.

     These terminals gave an unexpected boost to productivity, but
     they were only the beginning.  Next, a new generation of 300 baud
     terminals followed. Productivity improved by a factor of three!
     (Actually only 2.71828)

     Not long thereafter the 1,200 baud terminals joined the scene,
     and with them came an impressive further productivity improvement
     by a factor of four!!

     Progress, obviously, did not stop there.  The 9,600 baud
     terminals brought a further productivity improvement by a factor
     of eight!!!

     Not all of this improvement was due only to the speed increase.
     Much of it should be credited to the introduction of CRTs,
     allowing users to actually see what they would get from the
     line-printer.  "What You See Is What You Get" became one of the
     most fundamental principles of Computer Science.  It is commonly
     referred to as WYSIWYG (pronounced "wee-zee-wig").

     In parallel to the quantitative productivity increases the
     quality of the published papers also soared.  First came the
     change from old-fashioned line-printers to versatile 100ppi
     dot-printers.  Soon thereafter the quality of the scientific
     papers further increased with the introduction of 196ppi
     printers.

     Not much later a giant leap forward took place with the move to
     392ppi, quadrupling the quality of all scientific publications.
     This high resolution of the printing process promoted the use of
     multiple type-fonts. Their widespread use brought new peaks of
     quality never before achieved.

     However, progress was halted temporarily by software tools which
     allowed only 10 fonts per line.  As soon as this artificial limit
     was removed, progress resumed its normal exponential course.

     The average number of fonts per paper achieved an all time high.
     Papers which were rejected in the past could be reformatted,
     italicized, and printed by laser printers of higher and higher
     resolution, hence gaining higher levels of profundity, to the
     point that they had to be accepted by any scientific conference
     (especially those requiring submittals in camera-ready form).

     This progress made it possible to right-justify any idea, even
     those which could not be justified on any other ground.

     Sophisticated formatting proved to be the ideal tool for rescuing
     content-free articles which could not be saved even by their
     style.

     In addition, precise software control of type-font size supported
     the easy expansion of papers to fill any given space, a feature
     admired by editors of camera-ready conference proceedings.

     Society has not yet finished completely evaluating the move from
     slow, old fashioned terminals communicating at 10Kb/s to new
     workstations using 10Mb/s. It is expected that three orders of
     magnitude improvement in productivity is imminent.  Anything less
     would be most disappointing.

     The sacred WYSIWYG has been unanimously voted the Most Valuable
     Principle (MVP) of the year, hence securing its eternal place in
     the Computer Science Hall of Fame.

     Based on data available at the writing of this report a simple
     multi- dimensional statistical analysis proves that productivity
     is linear in workstation communication bandwidth (bit/sec) and
     bitmap dimension but is quadratic in both printing resolution
     (ppi) and the number of available printing fonts.
                                      2       2
           Pr = K x (BW) x (BD) x (PR)  x (NF)

        Where:  Pr  is the Productivity,
                K   is a constant,
               (BW) is the workstation communication bandwidth (bit/sec),
               (BD) is the bitmap dimension (bit x bit),
               (PR) is the printing resolution (ppi), and
               (NF) is the number of printing fonts.

       The dimension of K is:  (idea x sec x in^2) / (bit^3 x point^2)

     Unofficial statistics support the suspicion that there is a
     steady increase of the percentage of effort that the PhD
     dissertations in Computer Science devote to formatting.  It
     is impossible to believe that any significant work was
     ever conceived in the pre-WYSIWYG era, and since reports from that
     era are so hard to read there is no evidence to disprove this belief.

     It is hard to remember the days when quality was measured in
     ideas per article rather than points per inch, and justification
     did not refer only to the margins.

     Readers disagreeing with the conclusions of this report are
     challenged to read its proportionally-spaced italicized avec-serif
     version, printed on a laser printer of the highest resolution
     (available in PostScript, of course).  Needless to say that that
     version is much more profound than this one, and much more
     convincing.

    According to a Reuters report in the Washington Times which
    someone sent me (quoting without permission):

    GREENLAND MAKES IT OFFICIAL WITH $2 MILLION SANTA CENTER

COPENHAGEN (Reuters)-- Greenland has haunched an official Santa Claus
Post Office complete with psychologists[!] who will help answer up to
100,000 letters a year from children all over the world.
  The post office in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, part of a $2 million
Santa center that will be ready before Christmas, was inaugurated by
Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter on Tuesday [11-8-92].
  "Letters arrive every day, even in the summer.  There were 80,000 last
year and we think the figure will rise," *marketing manager* Frank Busk
told Reuters by telephone.... All letters receive a reply and a token
gift from Santa.
  The Christmas entertainment theme park, situated in an abandoned
dockyard, also features a workshop at which visitors can buy gifts, a
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer's Restaurant, Eskimo handicrafts and
stage shows.
  It aims to attract American and Japanese charter tourists.
  Greenland, Denmark's Arctic province, which is suffering from economic
recession, hopes Santa Claus will generate around $20 million in income
a year for the island.
  Mr. Schlueter said it is now an undisputed fact that Santa lives in
Greenland.
  "Legend has it that he lives in a castle of ice in Greenland, close to
the North Pole.  He still does.  But now we know that Santa's Post
Office is to be found in Nuuk, Greenland," said a first-day cover.
  Finland, a competitor for lucrative Christmas trade, has also claimed
Santa as its own.
  But the 29th World Congress of Father Christmases, meeting in
*Copenhagen*, agreed that Santa's sole address was "c/o the North Pole,
Greenland," and that FINLAND'S SANTA WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND, said Mr.
Busk, the marketing manager of Santa's Post Office.

    ============End of Quoted text====================

This is an attempt by Greenland and Denmark to grab a share of the
income Finland receives from being the land where Santa lives.  Finland
has a Santa's Post Office near the Arctic Circle at the town of Rovaniemi,
where Santa receives hundreds of thousands of letters a year.

Santa does not live in Rovaniemi, but every Finnish child knows that he
really lives on Korvatunturi, a hill on the Russian border in Lapland
far from any roads.  I know that US kids are told that Santa lives at
the North Pole, but that does not agree with the reindeer in the area or
the buildings made from local wood.  Both of these points also can serve
to demonstrate that Greenland also has the wrong environment for Santa's
residence.

The point of the Christmas theme park is obviously to raise money --
they hope to receive $20M per year (over $300 per resident of
Greenland), mostly from charter tourists.  Rovaniemi currently receives
a number of Concordes from the UK and Japan with Christmas tourists.

Mr. Schlueter's claim in the article, that it is an undisputed fact that
Santa lives in Greenland, is totally false, as millions of people realize
that he lives in Finland.  How could his residence be "in Greenland,
close to the North Pole" when New York is closer to Miami than Greenland
is to the Pole?

Denmark rigged its "World Congress of Father Christmasses" by not
allowing attendees from Finland.  Despite what they say, Santa's sole
address is NOT "c/o the North Pole, Greenland," as the Rovaniemi post
office which handles Santa's mail has not received a change of address.

The correct address for Santa Claus is:
        Santa Claus  [or St. Nick, Father Christmas, ... in any language]
        Rovaniemi 99999
        Finland

The mail will also get to Santa with "Arctic Circle", "Korvatunturi", or
even nothing as the town name (and of course people from other countries
are not expected to know the postal code).

Greenland may set up its theme park, but as the stickers available in
the post offices say, "Santa Claus comes from Finland."
