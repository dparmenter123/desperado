DEC Manuals are perhaps the worst I've ever seen.  By comparison, the manuals
we used in the Navy were terrific.  (In general I didn't like the Navy much,
and at the time I thought the manuals were terrible.  Little did I know that
industry manuals were even worse.)  Anyhow, over the 10 years I've been at DEC
I've learned to put up with almost anything, even PDP-11/40 Hardware and VMS
Software manuals.  Nevertheless, in the UDA50 Programmers Doc. Kit manuals I
think we have hit a new low.  For example, the following quote is from page
4-27 of the MSCP Basic Disk Functions Manual which is part of the above
mentioned Doc. Kit:

        As stated above, the host area of a disk is structured as a
        vector of logical blocks.  From a performance viewpoint, however,
        it is more appropriate to view the host area as a four
        dimensional hyper-cube, the four dimensions being cylinder,
        group, track, and sector.
                        .
                        .
                        .
        Referring to our hyper-cube analogy, the set of potentially accessible
        blocks form a line parallel to the track axis.  This line moves
        parallel to the sector axis, wrapping around when it reaches the edge
        of the hyper-cube.

Now, are we supposed to visualize a four-dimensional hyper-cube (a good trick)
or the three-dimensional representation (see "And He Built A Crooked House" by
Robert Heinlein)?  Maybe we are supposed to use the three-dimensional
representation to map a Grey Code sequence.  Who knows?  Who cares?!

Another fun example comes from page 2-2 of the same manual, the Terminology
chapter:

        Nugatory

            Of little or no consequence:  Trifling, Inconsequential.  See
            Section "AVAILABLE Command"

Using the Table of Contents we wend our way around to the "AVAILABLE Command"
on page 6-9 and find:

        It is nugatory to issue this command to a unit that is "Unit-Available"
        unless the "Spin-down" modifier is specified.

I know nugatory is a real word, but I still think it would be more effective to
say "It will have no effect" or "It will do nothing" or "Nothing will happen".

Anyhow, I thought you might enjoy these examples of Great Technical Writing.  I
hope this isn't the shape of things to come.

One of my favorite lines in this category comes from the all-time biggest
turkey movie ever made, "Plan Nine From Outer Space" (the first eight failed,
you see).  Two policemen are in a graveyard (complete with floppy cardboard
gravestones) and have discovered a murder victim.

        Cop #1: Looks like she's been murdered.

        Cop #2: Yeah, and somebody's responsible!

The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is showing on both Mass. and NH
public TV.  Both show it on Saturday and NH shows it Sunday morning at
11:30 as well.  Even if you haven't been watching it, haven't read the
book, aren't a science-fiction fan, if you like to laugh, tune it in.

One may wonder about the kind of person who could come up with anything as
strange as the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Well fans, if you watch
episode 2 (this Saturday on Channel 2), you will see that person in the
flesh, so to speak. Douglas Adams plays the dejected looking chauffeur at
the beginning of the episode who eventually gives up on life, the universe
and everything by strolling out to sea whence the human race originally
came from, sans diving gear (or anything else for that matter, including
his digital watch).

Here's another pet with a problem.  So far, every mistreated animal
mentioned in Desperado has found a happy home.  This one's name is
Oliver.

Subject: Please

A home is needed for a formerly abused but now attractive and
lovable kitten.  Oliver was discovered in the South End of Boston
by a young student nurse.  He had had hot tar thrown at him.  She
brought him back to her dormitory and he has been (furtively)
restored to full health and liveliness.  He is an orange/brown
tabby about 3 months old and is said to be very fond of people
and engaging, although not beautiful.  Pets aren't allowed in
B.U. dorms and said student nurse cannot bring herself to take
him to Angel Memorial.  If anyone wants to adopt Oliver, get
in touch with me--transportation will be provided to your home.

Came across this in the November issue of "Boston" magazine...

     Opening November 14 at the DeCordova Museum, Sandy Pond Rd.,  Lincoln,
     MA:

                       "Harold Cohen: Computer Drawings"

     This innovative show explores the  direct  collaboration  between  the
     mind  of  an  artist  and  a computer.  Through what he calls symbolic
     manipulation, Cohen's original computer  drawings  are  translated  by
     machine  onto  canvas and then hand-colored.  A complementary exhibit,
     "From Pong to Pac-Man,"  documents,  demonstrates,  and  analyzes  the
     impact  of  computer  graphics  and  video  games  on  today's  visual
     environment    through    photographs,    film    enlargements,    and
     visitor-operated video games.

     Hours: Tues-Fri 10am-5pm, Wed 10am-9:30pm, Sat noon-5pm, Sun 1:30-5pm
     Admission: Adults $1.50, Students and the elderly, 50 cents

Subject: Elementary Basic

"Elementary Basic" by Ledgard and Singer is actually the best introduction to
Basic for non-technical people I've ever seen.  I bought it for my wife.

There are, of course, dialogues between Holmes and Watson in Conan Doyle's
style. The Basic programming enters into it when they are solving mysteries.
For example, they want to figure out whether it is possible for a particular
suspect to travel by train from Birmingham to London with a long enough
stopover at Oxford to commit the crime.  Naturally, Homles says this is "an
excellent case for the analytical engine, Watson", and they proceed to program
it, ostensibly on Babbage's machine.  Babbage is a character, by the way.

Another mystery is titled "The Ciphered Message", which introduces ASCII.

They even manage to get into programming style in a discussion of top-down
analysis.

Most Basic books start out with quadratic equations in the first chapter.
"Elementary Basic", on the other hand, assumes that the reader is intelligent,
but does not know algebra.
