Let's tell some tales of this sort of thing.

Just last night I dreamed I had come up with a solution to the problem
of how to help naive users who didn't know what to do, or who didn't
even know they needed help.  This is part of my new job, but my dream
solution was that any 'null command' (carriage return) would put them
into Help.  Everybody in my dream thought this was brilliant, but on
reflection it's not likely to help the naive user much.

Once, when I was working on RSX device drivers, I dreamed I was the
null device (NL:).  All night long I lay there emitting 'end-of-file'
to every read and 'success' to every write.

Janet Egan was once caught in a traffic jam and noticed that she was
entering CTRL/Z on the top of the steering wheel to clear the jam.

Jonathan Ostrowsky once hit the flush lever twice and then caught
himself, saying, 'These things don't have typeahead, do they?'

Both Janet and Jonathan have left DEC, but they're still keyboarding
away elsewhere in this big beautiful brain-banging industry of ours.

So, what like experiences can the Desperados recall?

Subject: Tough times ahead in the export market

Many of you have already read the articles which have appeared in the
New York Times and the Boston Globe about the new restrictions being
placed on export of our hardware.

Last week I was at DECUS in Germany, among some very upset customers,
including a University Professor from Dresden (East Germany).

Under the new requirements, which the commerce department put into
effect for Digital (and at the moment only Digital), we no longer have
a general license for export; each shipment must be individually
licensed.

The strongest controls will be on our best technology.  But at the
moment, there is no differentiation.  It is this lack of differentiation
which has our customers most upset.

The chairman of DECUS-Muenchen started the session "Discussion with the
Senior Management (of Digital Equipment GmbH)" by reading a document
(translated below) which customers had to sign before the DEC bookstore
at DECUS would sell anything.

By signing the document, the customer certifies that no technical
information ever received from DEC nor any products which make that
data useful will be directly or indirectly exported to a list of
East-Bloc countries.

The all-inclusiveness of this statement, which, once signed, applies to
everything from DEC, past, present, and future, prevents distribution
of even the local DECUS newsletter to any of the local members from the
DDR (such as Professor Kramer from Dresden, an RSX user) or from the
German-speaking portions of Hungary, since the newsletter might mention,
among other things, that DECsystem-10s and 20s are 36-bit machines.

And the DECUS SIG tapes cannot be sent to these members, either.

The customers were quite upset at being forced to take part in U.S.
politics, and when the DECUS chairman said that if he were required to
sign the document, he would rather not buy from DEC.  In fact, the
bookstore sold almost nothing after this was discussed for the rest of
the symposium.

In the discussion which ensued, the CEO of DEC GmbH explained that there
was nothing that the German subsidiary could do about the situation, that
the customers were going to have to live with it for a while.  He told
them that he agreed that the all-inclusive and retroactive nature of the
document was a problem, but that for now the document would have to be
signed, or they would have to wait before making purchases.

One customer commented that these were "almost Russian conditions."

The following is a translation of the document:

CERTIFICATION

I/we hereby certify that I/we will neither directly nor indirectly export
or reexport any technical data or any products which make such data useful
to the following countries:

Afghanistan, Albania, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic
Republic (including East Berlin), Hungary, Cambodia, Laos, Latvia, Libya,
Lithuania, People's Republic of Mongolia, North Korea, People's Republic
of China (excluding the Republic of China), Poland, Rumania, USSR, or
Vietnam

without having previously obtained the written agreement of the U.S.
Department of Commerce, Office of Export Administration, according
to the extant regulations.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Presumably these restrictions stem from that VAX that some crook tried
to smuggle to the Soviet Union via Sweden.  There are many smuggled
American computers in the Soviet Union, but most of them were made by
IBM, which is not being put under these constraints.

An ABC sports commentator interviewed the British olympic ice-dancing stars
Jane TORVILL and Christopher DEAN before their gold-medal performance in the
world championship competition in Ottawa.  Having announced to the TV audience
that he was about to pop the "burning" question, the reporter initiated the
following dialogue:

ABC:  Well, uh, uh, I guess we all want to know about the future for
      Torvill and Dean...do we hear wedding bells?

TORVILL: Does anybody believe we've had time to prepare for a wedding with the
         Olympics and World Championships?

ABC:  I see... uh, well, is there anything to your relationship that's more
      than strictly professional?

DEAN: That's for us to know.

ABC: Thank you very much, Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean.

Torvill and Dean produced beautiful smiles for the camera during the
interview.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Come on, Torvill!  You too, Dean!  Have you two been jingling the
bedsprings?

It's only fair to point out that Torvill and Dean inject a lot of
'passion' into their act, with many molten stares and lots of lying
around writhing on the ice in each other's clutches.  Still, a better
question would have been, 'What makes what you do a sport?'

Sports I'd like to see in the Olympics:  baseball, motocross, bicycle
motocross, skateboarding, surfing . . . .

Triangle personhole advantage/round disadvantage:

Did you ever notice that when a yellow (or white) line is painted over a
personhole cover, within a few weeks something will need tending within
the personhole, and the cover will be replaced with the yellow line segment
at a large angle to the original?  (Clearly a corollary of M's law.)
Triangle covers make it more likely that the cover will be replaced with
the yellow line lined up.

Subject: On the subject of personhole covers....

There are alternatives to a circle or equilateral triangle although I
have yet to see one on a "personhole" cover. Ask anyone in the U.K. for
either a 20 or 50 pence piece - I forget the technical name for the
shape of these coins but they are five-sided with constant diameter, thus
with the addition of a lip could be made so that they too would not fall
onto the head of any person/operative within said hole. On second thought,
I don't know anyone small enough to pass through a hole the size of a
coin (although I understand that some European/Scandinavian countries
have coins around a hole, but that's another story.....).

Interesting to read the many explications of "Why triangular manhole
covers?"  Sociologically, I can't help wondering also "WHY NASHUA?"
I was told it is the only city in the U.S. that has them.  Progressive,
regressive, or just peculiar?

Pound for pound, triangular covers are probably a bit easier
to remove and replace.  (Does Nashua have (m)any females in its
municipal labor force?)  One could, I think, lift it by one corner
and overturn it against a stable straight-edge base with most of its
mass close to the ground, and of course with no chance of it rolling
away.  You could move it by "walking" it along the ground.

Next case.  I'm pretty sure "The Little Blue Man" novelty song
can be blamed on a singer named Betty Johnson.  Ms. Johnson was
one of Jack Paar's lesser regulars; she never quite reached the
prominence of Carol Burnett, Florence Henderson, Alexander King,
et al.  I think it was somewhat later than 1954, because Steve
Allen had the NBC late evening slot then.  For aggressive
insipidness and plain silliness, the song easily surpasses Red
Buttons' "Hoo Hoo Song" or anything by Don Ho (with the obvious
exception of "Tiny Bubbles").

"The Little Blue Man" (c)1958 was recorded by someone
named Betty Johnson for Atlantic Records.

The tune was written by Fred Ebb and Paul Klein.
Ebb is much better known as the co-writer of the
score for the Broadway musical "Cabaret".

"Walking My Cat Named Dog" (c)1966 was written and recorded
by one Norma Tanega for the New Voice label.

5-figure phone bills for the innocent victims, they should build
something into their billing program to shut off a number once a
specified limit has been reached? Surely this can't be beyond the
limitations of their technology. Just asking...

As you may have noticed I have changed my "personal name".  My old one,
MuLP P. Gill, which is a story in itself has been superseded by
                <b>PRODUCT IS THE GOAL</b>
which is a number of stories.  One that I don't want to go into involves
VMSMAIL and how I managed to get that particular one set.

What I really wanted to ask about is this.  About ten years ago Dave Cutler
and a cast of characters started building RSX-11M.  One of Dave's trademarks
was a rubber stamp that said "SIZE IS THE GOAL" that was impressed on anything
8-1/2 by 11 that passed by Dave.  Since then DEC has moved from using paper
for everything to using paper to fill wastebaskets.

So, what is the equivalent of the rubber stamp (preferably red) across
the top of all memos and mail in the modern world ?

                                Regards
                                MuLP

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, whatever it is, it will never be noticed in all the mishmash
that shows up on top of those memos that come from that other net that
is not our beloved engineering net.  Interesting that the engineering
net gives nice clean mail headers while the net used by upper management
always fills a page and a half worth of routing and forwarding garbage
before getting to the message.

Node names are occasionally inspirational in nature.  And, as you say,
the 'personal name' line from VMS.  You can also give your VMS process
a slogan instead of a name.  I don't recall the command, but mine says
'RSX Rules!'

I should explain that MOUNT/PARMENTER in the subject line, speaking of
garbage.  Many years ago, MuLP and I had mighty wars about the syntax
of the RSX MCR MOUNT command.  When he finally wrote the code, he
stuck /PARMENTER in as a synonym for /PARameter.  Immortality is mine!

     What do the Desperados think will form an 'Intelligent Network' ?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Can I ask for some help from the Readership please ?

In ENE we are tussling with ideas of where Networks and Communications will
lead to in the next decade. The first computer Networks in the 60's/early
70's were hardwired and hence 'simple'; The next generation - say the late
70's to date are 'instinctive' in that they will allow for adaptive routing
and other useful features - but all the abilities are drawn from a limited
set of options that has been pre-determined in tables etc.

So what will the next generation of 'Intelligent Networks' be able to do ?
Are we well placed to be able to achieve such networks ? Who else can - IBM ?
who else cannot - IBM ?

I have posed this question in the Vogon News Service and had some useful
feedback from Dosadi::Binder - we found that we needed to establish what we
meant by 'intelligent' so I developed the model set out below. Please use this
model only to get ideas -  it is a conceptual model; also, do not be put off
by implentation details - eg the size of the disks or the speed of the
processor should not concern you.  PLEASE LET YOUR BRAINS RUN FREE.

Here is the model.....

In the old days of the telephone (in the UK at least) it was a manual
switchboard, usually located in the village Post Office/general goods store
and to make a call you picked up your reciever at home. The operator then
asked what number you wanted - if you said 'Littlewick Green 7' she was able
to say - "oh there's no point in putting you through there because Tommy has
just been in here on his way to the Ale House so I will put you through
there"

This is more than adaptive routing - The Operator (a network processor) has
collected dynamic data, she has drawn inferences from the data, she has
processed it on a time base - i.e., Tommy is supping now and is not yet  home,
and she has used an associative memory to relate "Littlewick Green 7" with
the village drunk or whatever.

Please mail me on Marvin::gascoigne or call me on 7830-3641 if you want to; I
will be very grateful for all ideas, however bizarre.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Hmm.  I'd think the most dangerous adversary in the intelligent
network department would be the newly unshackled AT&amp;T.

One of the simple pleasures that hacker mail systems like NMail and
the RSX mail that I use for Desperado is that they are capable of
storing and forwarding mail, something none of the corporately
anointed mail systems do.  This means that if a node is down, the
mailer keeps trying until it comes up, or a time-out period passes.
That is not what our correspondent is looking for, I'm sure, but we
should remember that little things mean a lot.

I'd like to have my mail sorted by subject matter before I read it.
Some messages I'd like to hear about right away and some only between
9-12 AM  and 1-5 PM on work days.

I'm sure I'll think of something else.

                  Judges Actualize Top Contest Input
                            by Steve Lopez

     Gene Fifield has been a nerd for 10 years.

     He's an engineer for McDonnell Douglas Electronics in Palo  Alto.
     His  wife,  Melody,  can't  stand it when Fifield comes home from
     work and blabbers Silicon Valspeak technodrivel.

     "I hate the language, so I try to do a lot to humanize him,"  she
     said.   "We  have  a  record called 'The Nerds' to keep things in
     perspective.  And when we go out, I make him talk to humans."

     She also encouraged him to enter the Silicon Valspeak contest - a
     spoof  of  the  language  -  that was announced last Sunday in my
     column.

     The   challenge   was   to   assemble   the   most   nonsensical,
     indecipherable, high-technology gibberish in a mock press release
     - the same sort of thing specially trained Silicon  Valley  nerds
     do  for $50,000 a year.  The prize:  a free pizza or two hours at
     a bar of my choice.  I'm a high roller.

     Entries came from high-tech and non-tech people.  One guy wrote a
     high-tech  poem  of low-tech caliber.  One guy pleaded for a job.
     One guy denigrated me.  But nobody did  better  than  Fifield,  a
     Santa Clara resident.

     Five judges, none of whom knows anything about  technology,  were
     in  virtual  agreement.  Fifield got 433 points out of a possible
     500, three points more than David Sullivan of MDS  Associates  in
     San Jose.

     To end the suspense that probably has crippled Silicon Valley for
     the  past week, and to show how deranged Fifield has become in 10
     years of high-tech work, here is his masterpiece:

     InfoWorld  Magazine in Palo Alto was third, Cliff Gold of Fremont
     was fourth, and Nick Herlick of San Jose was fifth.

     The Poor Sport Award went to Walter R.  Morgan of San  Jose,  who

     Marc J.  Stanley of San Jose was the  most  industrious,  writing
     that his entry is based on a real product and "all I want is some

     Richard E.  Ewing of San Jose wrote the best sentence:  "Data SUK
     is  an  informationally-delineated  windowing environment for the
     semi-computer literate facilitated with a not unhostile interface
     utilizing the now industry-accepted pigpen metaphor."

     you must swiftly leave my presence."

     If you have complaints about the outcome, don't  direct  them  to
     me.   I  appointed  four other judges for that purpose.  Here are
     thumbnail sketches and qualifications.

     Mark Goldberg, KOME radio news director.  None.

     Mark Johnson, San Jose News assistant city editor.  None.

     Dale  Yoshihara,  bartender  at  Bini's  Bar  &amp;   Grille.    He's
     accustomed to language that makes no sense.

     My Aunt Mimi, who lives in Sunnyvale and said, "Buta Steva,  I'ma
     no cana understanda the regular English." She's Italian.

     "Steva," Aunt Mimi said while judging the entries,  "Don't  tella
     nobody  I'ma  gota  only thirda grade education.  But I tella you
     onea thing, believa me or not, I thinka alla thesa  people,  they
     be crazy."
