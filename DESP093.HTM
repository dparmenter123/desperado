        LOGGED ON AND TURNED OFF: THE INVASION OF THE POD PEOPLE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I got my first phone call from one of those robot phoners the other
day.  He said his name was Hal.  I should have stayed to listen, but I
just said, "Good bye, Hal" and hung up.

I overheard some young businessmen talking in the Atlanta airport.

One said, "That was when I realized was that my Rolodex was a data
base.  Nobody ever told me." Another chimed in, "My list of 22 clients
is the most important data base I have." The conversation buzzed along
awhile, then the third man, apparently some sort of computer salesman,
said, "He's as out of date as an Altair with 2K of memory."

So, there's a lot of talk about computers out there in the world.
Unfortunately, not all the talk is as clever and witty as this stuff.

The Boston Globe, for instance, a newspaper that regularly surveys the
world from a lofty moral pinnacle (approximately as high as a pimple
on a clam) has discovered the menace of the computer nerd and
declared war.  On the first page of the Globe's Sci-Tech section an
article flagged "Psychology" claimed to be reporting the finding of
some psychologists that "the microchip can short circuit some human
psyches . . . a phobia of extremes in which the victims are either
always logged on or totally turned off.  One the one hand, some seem
gripped by an irrational fear of computers; on the other, some have
become so obsessed with the digital world that they begin losing touch
with the real one."

The piece says no more about the pathetic digiphobe but concentrates
on the "bright and creative people in the computer industry who appear
to have fallen victim to their own love affair with the machines,
gradually disappearing into the painless, pliant world of the work
place and eschewing personal relationships, which can be threatening
and unpredictable."

The computer companies are trying to cover this up, the Globe thinks,
including some people whose computer addiction led to their
hospitalization.  Mostly men, the doctor says.  "At a Digital
Equipment plant in Nashua, N.H., a member of the medical staff, who
asked not be be named, said that it's not hard to spot 'computer
personalities,' preoccupied types who tend to dominate among software
engineers, as opposed to hardware engineers and technical writers.
'I've seen software engineers walk into walls and never notice.  They
have terminals at home.  Some literally work around the clock.  When
you find high blood pressure in a slim young nonsmoker, one gets
suspicious about stress.'"  The article later quotes DEC's tame Nashua
psychologist, Roger LaMora, who says that there may be "too-precise
expectations from a computer-software parent as to the way children
should behave".

Has somebody been walking into walls and not noticing while Dr. LaMora
was around?

Has anybody ever heard the expression, "What kind of happy horseshit
is this?"

Right next to this feeble drippety-drip-drip is the column "Computers
and You" under the headline, "The Pod People". This one is a review of
a book called "Technostress:  The Human Cost of the Computer
Revolution".  The theme is the computer is a horrible new drug, and
reports this common experience, which has happened so tragically, to
so many.  "One day, they have a friend, cosmopolitan, sophisticated,
interested, and interesting.   When next they meet all she can talk
about is operating systems and disk drives.  If somebody brings up a
subject with no digital aspects she begins to fidget.  Her jaws grow
slack and her eyes vacant.  What might have turned this vital human
being into a robot?  She'll tell you herself  -- her new Apple IIe."

And then you go on to the hard stuff, the whole 32 bits.

And what are the effects?  It takes over your brain.

According to the author of the book, Craig Brod, a West coast
industrial psychologist, sufferers from "the computer nightmare' begin
to think of "conversation as data transfer and memory as a search
procedure". These people "avoid people who talk slowly or in general
terms, lose the ability to communicate with gesture and eye contact
and effect a waxen expressionlessness".  The Globe reviewer asks,
"Sound like anybody you know?"

Well, no, actually.

What follows perhaps the most brilliant (unintentional) evocation of
the false, lying, con-man world of the West coast industrial
psychologist who writes nasty books like this to sell for $16.95.
Read it slowly.  This is the reviewer, summing up the author's
evidence:

        "Brod's evidence for this change rests largely on the inherent
         plausibility of the thesis, although he does sprinkle his
         text with scores of anecdotes:

        "- The wife of the director of computer services for a large
         bank recalls that when they first met he was a warm sensitive
         man.  Today he has no close friends and his only recreational
         activity is watching TV.  He has no patience for easy and
         informal conversation.

        "-As an example of Kay's behavior, Arnold reports that one
         night in bed she turned to him and said, 'Are you on-line
         tonight or not?'  Arnold regrets encouraging Kay's computer
         use."

No, I don't know who Arnold and Kay are, and I don't know whether
Arnold was on-line or not, but doesn't your heart ache when you read
what computers did to that poor banker?  I'll tell you one thing.  I'm
defending all my crackpot theories from now on out on the basis of
"the inherent plausibility of the thesis".  The Globe's pissant
reviewer, Fred Hapgood, chides the industrial psycho for not being
willing to face the consequences of horrible findings, "the beginning
of a kind of pandemic autism".  Hapgood wants it stopped immediately:
"Clearly, extreme measures, such as the abolition of computers
altogether, are called for."  All Brod has to offer is that the
computer should be turned off 20 minutes before dinner and that they
should talk to their kids about how they *feel* about computers.

Now this is all stiff and rank and silly, but there it is.   The Globe
is out to get us, kids, and save the world from pandemic autism.

This is another example of a story completely overlooked by the Boston
Herald.  The Globe, on the other hand, is the paper that that made
almost nothing of the murder of the beautiful young art student and
prostitute and the accusation against her psychology professor lover,
who embezzled from a grant to buy her pretty things so she would love
him.   Now, which paper has the news?  Stories about real people?

Having sailed on the 110-foot Brigantine Romance several times
totalling nearly 3 years and including a 20-month circumnavigation,
I'm on the mailing list of Romance's Log - a report of recent
adventures, passages, and events. Written by Gloria Kimberley, the
Skipper's wife, this one relates the story of being in Grenada at the
time of the coup last October. Anyone wanting more information about
Romance can contact me on AJAX::.

--------------------------------------------------------------

GRENADA: In 18 years of cruising strange and sometimes uncertain parts
of the world, I suppose it's inevitable we should one day run afoul of
somebody's war. Grenada has always been our favorite layup port, where
shipwrights retain the traditional wooden ship skills of adz and
caulking mallet. Romance has always found a warm welcome and safe
haven in the landlocked, sun-dappled lagoon of St. Georges. By day
the singing of Teddo's saw, and the tonk-tonk of old Mr. Bristol's
mallet, the rasp of sandpaper and the light-hearted chatter of the
West Indians. At night, the blessed cool wind, the music of the tree
frogs, and just before dawn, the torches of night fishermen bobbing
out to sea below the ancient fort at the entrance.

Political upheaval is an old story in hot countries. Grenada's popular
Prime Minister Maurice Bishop had been placed under house arrest in a
power struggle with the military, there were rumors of an
assassination plot against Bishop, and the people were demonstrating
peacefully for his release. The spectre of a Head-of-State under house
arrest was viewed with alarm by neighboring island nations, and, we
learned later, a Caricom force was even then being considered to free
Bishop. Radio Free Grenada began calling up members of the Security
Forces; and on the evening of October 18th, announced that all cabinet
ministers had resigned. They were arrested soon after.

Wednesday October 19th began a typical hot, sunny morning in the
lagoon. Schools were closed, and the students were massing to try to
free Bishop. About 10 AM, the staccato popping of automatic gunfire
suddenly erupted in the direction of the Bishop house behind the
lagoon, sounding unreal - theatrical. But they were very real bullets
that tore through the rigging, and Mate Pat Nelson, tarring backstays
aloft, set a record sliding down! We were torn between watching, and
seeking shelter below the waterline, safe inside Romance's foot-thick
wooden hull. The firing was soon over.

After lunch, our Grenadians came back aboard with the news that a
large crowd had stormed the Bishop home, and were now taking him to
the market to speak to the people, chanting, "We got our leader
back!". Some said four students had been killed or "damaged".
(Grenadian expression).

All quiet till 1 PM, when firing began again from the fort across the
harbor. Every pair of binoculars in the yacht fleet trained on the
incredulous sight of the old fort suddenly coming to life after
perhaps a century of peaceful slumber! Even in the bright sunlight we
could see artillery flashes, and soon a pall of heavy black smoke.
People running along the ramparts and jumping from the old gray stone
walls - a jump of 30 or 40 feet. Dull explosions and very heavy
firing, but soon all was quiet again.

Radio Free Grenada went off the air in mid-song, and it was not until
10 PM that the Security Forces had fabricated their preposterous
story. In chilling tones, General Hudson Austin informed the Grenadian
people that their leader, Maurice Bishop, and his Cabinet Ministers
had been killed "storming the fort". Though weak, half naked and
tortured, Bishop was supposed to have "taken the guns away from the
officers and men at the fort and armed the crowd". The Security Forces
then called in an armored car to "retake the fort". We were to hear
later from eye witnesses, that Bishop had been recaptured at the
market, and taken into the fort, the crowd of thousands following. The
armored car, filled with masked men, variously described as Cubans and
Russians, fired on the crowd, killing men, women, and children, who
lept over the walls, some to lie injured in the tropic sun, in the
underbrush below the fort.

Hudson Austin continued his stunning proclamation: there was now in
effect a 4 day and night curfew, and anyone on the streets would be
shot ON SIGHT! We sat on deck in the tranquil moonlight and pondered.
We were four aboard, Skipper, myself, Pat and 76 year old Matthew
Bristol from Carriacou. Our layup was only half completed, with
steering in pieces, engine shifting gear locked up in the Government
machineshop, and two anchors out, including the 750 pound storm anchor
normally requiring a large crew. Our Fall crew, due to report in days,
would obviously not now be coming to Grenada. By flashlight, Skipper
put the steering together, and began to assemble a workable "stick
shift" out of a stout 4-by-4. By morning, we were mobile again: haul
on a block and tackle on top of the engine to go ahead; kick the oak
stick shift out again for neutral. So far, so good. There remained the
storm anchor to heave up. A patrol boat with machine gun mounted,
roared to life as we started to heave, and watched us until sure we
were not going to run for it. It took hours in the ominous calm of the
curfew. Not a yacht moved. Not a dingy crossed the glassy lagoon. A
man led his cow to pasture along the lagoon road, accompanied by an
armed soldier.

A Cuban "cargo" ship, with two rows of portholes the entire length of
her hull, moved into port and tied up. Not a soul on deck, but she
must have been loaded with troops. She had been in Grenada only the
week before. The long hot day dragged on, while neighbor nations
called for a recess in the curfew to allow families to get food and
water. A second night passed in silence. In the morning, our painters,
Lincoln and Cleary, and Lincoln's brother, who had been at the fort
and jumped the wall, defied the curfew and stole out to the ship, full
of the enormity of the disaster. Lincoln had heard a firing squad at
the fort at midnight, and again at 3 AM. And so Maurice Bishop had
been executed in the old fort, renamed Fort Rupert just a few years
ago, to honer his father - also slain in a political uprising.

The four-hour recess came at 10 AM, every yacht clammering for
permission to sail. We could see our engine parts scattered on the
floor of the machine shop, but nobody had the key. We left without the
parts, the tackle performing perfectly. Stealing out under the guns of
the fort, with Lincoln and Mr. Bristol hidden below, we felt like an
escaping ship-of-the-line in a Hornblower saga. Hurrying North under
the brooding mountains, in the brightest of moonlight, each of us
wondered if we would ever see that beautiful island again. Armed
patrol boats passed uncomfortably close, and at midnight, we hove-to
and rowed Mr. Bristol ashore to his home in Carriacou. At 1:30 AM,
halfway between Carriacou and Union Island, we passed the invisible
line into freedom. A week later, the one yacht left in Grenada -
caught up on the drydock during the shelling - was launched and
departed, bringing our engine parts.

We sailed our Nov. 1st cruise on schedule, but from St. Vincent. The
Down Island cruises were full and happy, especially for us. In the
opinion of those who were there, the rescue of Grenada by US and
Caricom forces was absolutely necessary. Sister nations could not
stand by and see Grenada, her entire lawful government slain, fall to
Cuban and Russian interests.

mallet.

I saw MAC at the Boston Computer Society on monday night.
What happened there was more like a rock concert or broadway
opening than anything else.

About 3 K people showed up, and I think about 1 K got in (I just
missed the cutoff).  As we walked in we got literature on the product,
a list of local dealers with addresses, phones, and a T-shirt (no
I only got one).  We sat down and waited until the crowd could
be seated.  The place went black, and Jobs walked up to the podium.
The following are his words, the best I can remember:

"In 1958, XEROX invented the copy machine.  IBM ignored it.....
"In 1968, Digital Equipment began successfully selling a minicomputer.
"IBM ignored this until DEC became a multi-hundred million dollar
company"
"In 1977, APPLE invented the personal computer, in a garage......
"In 1981, IBM introduced its PC and a shakeout in the industry started,
and........
"Now its 1984.  Was Orwell right? Are we all going to wear blue pin
stripes, are we all the
same, are we going to let them tell us what to do!"

Again the place went black and they showed the 1984 tv advertisement.

By this time, all us techie's and IBM haters were in a frenzy (non-IBM
haters were converted).
He went on to demo the product, and run a number of multimedia presentations
including two screens and stereo sound.  The quality of this hype
was top notch.  I felt a lot like I was in one of those PEPSI commercials.

He showed a slide show on how 50 people made the product.  He listed
all of their names, his own included alphabetically.  He showed us
the inside of the back enclosure....all of their signatures are in
the tool.  He brought 8 or 10 of them with him, and they ran various
demos of the stuff they developed, periodically interrupted by applause.
The recognition he offered to the people who actually did the work
had a great effect on both the audience and his employees.

Clearly, I had a great time (it was more fun than EVITA or CATS).
But is this important?

I think so.  I saw 3 major success factors exhibited:

  1.  GOOD MERCHANDIZING:  Nothing like a guy from Pepsi to help
      when you need this.  You'll see the "real adds" against
      the Olympics.  The 1984 add was for the boss.
  2.  SOFTWARE:  Included in the hype were testimonials from Mitch Kapor
      (LOTUS), and Bill Gates (MICROSOFT) telling us all about the
      applications they were developing.
  3.  PRODUCT:  Last and least, but they have a damn nice one.  In
      effect, they have a 32 bit workstation at every thousand dollars
      from $2.5 K (MAC), to $5.5 K (10MB LISA).

He talked a little about futures.  A LAN called APPLENET is included
in the product.  This summer he will sell a little $25 "transformer"
that couples this to a twisted pair.  This fall he will sell a 3270
server, some "small/cheap" fileservers (10-20MB), a lazer printer
for $5K, and a UNIX server for UNIX freaks.

Their slogan is that this is all "insanely great!"  They have positioned
themselves as the IBM alternative, and the "good guys."  IBM of course,
is "Big Brother."

Can we beat them?  The answer to that question lies in what you think
about success factors 1 and 2.  I believe we can, but we will have to
change......., a lot.

Subject: When are you dead?

From "Hazarding Hypothermia" by Dougald MacDonald
in the January 16th issue of the NEW HAMPSHIRE TIMES

    As the Army's expert on hypothermia, Dr. [Murray] Hamlet [from Natick, MA]
has often received telephone calls from Army doctors and generals who want to
know how to treat a soldier or why one died.  Hamlet said: "They tell me they
ran a group of Army Rangers through a Georgia swamp for two days, wearing full
packs and eating one meal a day.  The air and water temperature were both 40
degrees F. And they want to know why someone died.  I ask them a few questions
and more often than not I can tell them it was hypothermia.  They say he was
found with no vital signs and a core temperature of 78 degrees F, so they knew
he was dead.  But we've revived people with temperatures down to 61 degrees F.
Within my lifetime I expect we'll bring someone back from the low fifties,
maybe the forties.  I have to tell them `Not only was that guy alive when you
pronounced him dead, he may have been alive when you buried him.'"

    Thanks to work by Hamlet and other doctors, deaths such as these are
becoming rare in the Army and in civilian life.  "Failure to respond to
rewarming is the only sure criteria for establishing death in hypothermia
cases", said Dr. Hamlet.  "We have a saying in our business: You're not
dead until your're warm and dead."

Subject: RSX-11M war story

A site in Canada that did ore sample analysis using a small nuclear
reactor needed a new RSX-11M system generation. An important potential
customer was coming the next afternoon.

So at 5 p.m. a fellow who had never done a system generation went
downstairs to do one. Note: the system was a PDP-11/34 with two RK05s.

After about eight hours of painstaking boredom, the sysgen bombed
because there was not enough contiguous space to make RSX11M.SYS. After
spending a couple of hours backtracking through the console listing, the
fellow found his error. And started over.

From scratch.

After another eight hours, he successfully made RSX11M.SYS, ran VMR on
it, booted the new system, and typed SAV /WB.

He waited a minute.

He waited five minutes. He was not concerned, the entire process up to
this point had taken 18 hours.

He waited an hour. He looked in the manual and it said nothing about how
long SAV /WB took. He went upstairs and got another fellow.

They both waited another hour.

They started to get concerned. There was not time to start over before
the big customer arrived.

They started calling around Canada. The third call reached someone who
said SAV /WB should only take 15 seconds.

They started to get more concerned. Their sixth call reached someone who
said SAV /WB sometimes gets hung with a memory problem.

The fellow had read once that you can tell bad memory because the chips
are hot. He was desperate. He pulled the CPU box, took off the cover,
and reached into a live machine to feel the chips.

He touched a hot chip.

This was a materials laboratory. He got a flask of liquid nitrogen and
poured it into the CPU.
