        Karl Marx was right:  The State is withering away alright.

        Does everybody remember there was no "Russian Revolution" in 1917?
        There was only only a successful coup d'etat (that is, a  putsch)
        backed by the Germans and directed against the legitimate
        democratic government that  had taken power after the czar withered
        away.

        The London Sunday Times had a bit the other other day:  "The
        Communist Party of the Soviet Union died yesterday after a lengthy
        illness.  It was 88. . . . Survivors include orphans all over the
        world."

                                    =*=

        Back in the 50s and early 60s, when anti-communism and
        anti-anti-communism were competing political fads, the
        anti-anti-communists were much disdainful of "Captive Nations
        Week", wherein sincere, aging Lithuanians in ugly suits and ties
        stood in front of the capitol with their funny looking flags and
        presented boring petitions full of rhetoric about the rape and
        betrayal of their so-called countries to reactionary congressmen
        from the darkest midwest.  Yet now we see that there are these
        three countries, not unlike the Scandanavian countries, or Holland
        and Belgium, that were, in fact, raped and betrayed by Hitler and
        Stalin, oppressed by the Soviets, and yet survived with their
        sense of nationhood intact.

                                    =*=

        BTW, of course I understand why Boris closed the newspapers, and
        I'm pretty sure I would have in his position.

                                    =*=

        This nationalism stuff is going to do wonders for stamp
        collecting.

                                    =*=

        Boris sent a thank-you note to Pizza Hut, which kept them alive
        while they were fighting the putsch.  He should send one to
        Richard Nixon too.  Nixon was pals with Mr. Pepsi, Joan Crawford's
        husband, and arranged for Pepsi to penetrate the Soviet Union ahead
        of Coke.  Pizza Hut is a subsidiary of Pepsi.  Furthermore, it's
        probalbly the only restaurant in Moscow that delivers.  One reason
        for the success of American fast food, which is enormously
        expensive over there, is that people love getting polite service, a
        new idea in Russian restaurants.

                                    =*=

        Uff!  Imagine having to drink Pepsi and make love to Joan Crawford
        in the same life!

Subj:   Russian Revolution Issue revisited

Tom,

Last night's (September 9, 1991) 60 Minutes had a segment with a nice spin
on your growing list of metaphors for stupidity. Seems Uncle Joe Stalin
established under KGB control an Institute of Brain, mandating that the
group preserve  brains of communists in order to demonstrate the racial (?)
superiority of  communists. Burgeoning freedoms (not to mention chaotic
responses to the  crumbling Soviet bureaucracy) permitted a 60 Minutes team
to gain entrance not only to the Institute but even to the Institute's
sanctum sanctorum, Room 19.

In a nutshell, Room 19 contains the pickled brains of many of the USSR's
power elite: Lenin, Stalin, Dzherzinsky, Gorky, et al. Not much has come of
whatever "research" the Institute was doing, and hard times and low funding
have taken their toll, but the group is still active. The audience was told
that technicians arrived at Andrei Sakharov's deathbed within minutes of
his demise and carted his brain off to Room 19. I can't imagine Mme.
Sakharov agreeing to this, but who knows? In any case, as two Institute
workers were slicing two brains to prepare medical slides, an argument
broke out as to which of the two was slicing up Sakharov. The show ended
before a resolution was reached.

Therefore, let me add to your list: "He's living in Room 19."

        Einstein's brain is in a jar in a doctor's office in Missouri.
        Somewhere in the vast Desperado Archives of the Twentieth Centure
        and Before there's an explanation of how it got there, but as far
        as I know, no one has ever taken a slice of Einstein's gray matter
        to see if there are any other bright ideas lurking in there waiting
        to be discovered.

        Dzherzinsky was the founder of the KGB, although ion actuality the
        so-called Russian Revolution simply took over the existing Czarist
        secret police.  The Dzherzinsky statue that was torn down recently
        was 18 feet high and stuck out in front of the notorious Lubyanka
        HQ of the KGB, right in the middle of downtown Moscow.  Tour guides
        could easily omit any description of the function of Lubyanka, but
        tourists kept asking about the statue, so they couldn't ignore it.
        The official tour-guide line was, "He was very interested in
        education."

Howdy, Tom,

Great to see Painless Potter get a mention. "Son of Paleface" has been one
of my favorite make-out movies for a decade or so.

Also great to see that Simpsons references are still allowed in popular
culture. For some time now, I've had this recurring vision of a t-shirt
showing the usual Groening face-like-thing atop a prim 19th-century dress,
with the caption "EMILY SIMPSON" and the speech balloon "I'M NOBODY. WHO THE
HELL ARE YOU?" But I've been too lazy to do anything about it and was
worried that time had run out.

Subj:   NEO-TECH: Don't be without it!

The material from which the following quotations are taken arrived
unrequested in my mailbox.  I almost discarded it without reading (which
I now know would have been a terrible loss to medical science) when my
eyes lighted on the munificent claim:

  "With Neo-Tech, we the yesterday's victims are becoming today's
   financial victors.  We hold the power and know it.  No one can
   stop us from prospering as everyone will soon discover."

For more information, write to:

   I &amp; O Publishing Company, Inc.
   850  South Boulder Highway
   Henderson, Nevada   89015

To order the whole package ($69.95 including shipping, or $100 if you
don't order soon enough), write to P.O. Box 90400, Zip Code 89009.
After reading the rest of this, you'll no doubt be pleased to know that
there are Neo-Tech customers in 151 countries.  Although I ordinarily
expect this sort of thing to be from California, perhaps Nevada is
seeking new prominence in the field.  On the other hand, around half of
the Quotes From Satisfied Customers come from California.  Since this
material is copyrighted, I am only providing brief excerpts for review
purposes.

&gt;From the NTP News Report, a 16-page brown paper pamphlet, I quote:

  "An entire new field of knowledge has been discovered by Dr. Frank R.
   Wallace, a former Senior Research Chemist for E.I. du Pont de Nemours
   &amp; Co.

Indeed, according to his bio printed in tiny type on the same page, Dr.
Wallace is a man of many talents, chemistry but one of them.  Although
the origin of his honorific is not disclosed, he is said to be a member
of Sigma Xi, and to have written both books and magazine articles.  More
promising, however, is his past as an SEC-licensed security advisor and
editor of a national magazine (somehow, I suspect those two are closely
related), and also as a professional poker player (author of "Poker",
Warner Books, New York, no date).

  "Since mid-1976, Dr. Wallace has researched Psychous Advantages to
   uncover a powerful array of new knowledge called Neo-Tech.  That new
   knowledge allows any woman to prosper monetarily, personally, and
   financially anywhere in the world, even during personal or financial
   hard times, inflation, boom times, recession, depression, war.  I
   interviewed Dr. Wallace about Neo-Tech at his home in southern
   Nevada."

It seems faintly discriminatory that these Advantages are available only
to women, though perhaps there's more than one mailing list and I just
got the wrong one.  On the other hand, what woman seeking Psychous
Advantages would trust a man to provide them?

  "NTP: What is Neo-Tech?"
  "Wallace:  ... Believe it or not, I first sensed Neo-Tech through
   poker--the money game, the international strategy game. ...

  "NTP:  Can women really get rich by using Neo-Tech?  Or is Neo-Tech
   like sleazy cheating?
  "Wallace: Definitely not. ... Neo-Tech requires no risks or changes in
   life style--only a new scientific knowledge that generates profits
   and marriage-power.  ...  Neo-Tech will someday dominate most winning
   situations as it spreads into women's careers and personal
   relationships."

Around here, Dr. Wallace inserts a helpful chart showing the difference
in characteristics between an ordinary woman and a Neo-Tech woman, a few
entries of which are shown below:

   Ordinary Woman                      Neo-Tech Woman

   Worries that her cheating will      Knows that Neo-Tech cannot be
   be seen                             seen

   Worries about the consequences      Knows she cannot be caught
   of being caught in the act          in any act

   Is negative in every way            Appears beneficial in every way

  "NTP: What actually makes her [the Neo-Tech woman] so effective"
  "Wallace:  The Neo-Tech woman has the power to render others helpless,
   even wipe them out, but she wisely chooses to use just enough of her
   power to give her unbeatable casino-like advantages in all
   endevours."

The booklet goes on in this vein, with the interviewer eventually
exhorting readers to buy the package and hundreds of quotes from
satisfied customers.  The package is 5 volumes (which must be ordered
now before they are no longer available to U.S. citizens!).  Volumes I
and II are untitled (just Neo-Tech in general, perhaps), but Volume III
promises "Controlling Others", Volume IV "Predicting Stock Prices", and
Volume V "Job Power and Sexual Immortality".  An interesting
combination, that.

In addition to the booklet, a reproduced (without permission by them,
and likewise by me) flyer from "An Ad-Hoc Committee to Halt the
Publication and Circulation in America of Subversive Literative Called
NEO-TECH" warns:

  "Neo-Tech literative is extremely dangerous.  Neo-Tech has already
   been legislated against by certain foreign governments.  Hopefully,
   the United States Government will soon ban Neo-Tech.  For its
   literature is subversive to all known norms of government and
   religion.  ....
  "Thus, if you receive any literature or brochures about Neo-Tech, do
   not read that material or let anyone in your family read that
   subversive literature, especially young people. ...

In addition, the flyer points out that the Neo-Tech literature contains
the following warning--so don't tell any of 'em:

  "Neo-Tech products will not be sold to professional value destroyers
   at any price.  Those blackballed include all politicians, clergymen,
   and business quislings, most lawyers and news-media reporters, many
   bureaucrats and university professors."

So, if you're not a business quisling, order today.

And tell us what it's like if you do....

Listen Up, All You Punk Rockers Who Call The Rolling Stones Old
        Dave Kansas - Wall Street Journal

        Throughout the calm retirement community of Sun City, Ariz.,
residents are turning down their hearing aids.  Interrupting
the hum of lawn mowers and golf carts is a wailing electric
guitar.  A visiting grandson?  No.  It's the latest sound in
the Phoenix area, a senior citizen's punk-rock band called One
Foot In The Grave.
        "They play some hard-driving music," says
disc jockey Mary McCann at Tempe's alternative-music station
KUKQ, which has played one of the group's songs.  "But
sometimes it gets a little polkaesque."
        The polka-punk sound, which threatens to put Sun City on the
music map, has been maturing for three years.  With two recent
local performances and some Phoenix-area air play of a
group-made tape, the band may be on the verge of breaking out.
        The driving force is lead singer Jo Dina, who founded the
group after placing newspaper ads for musicians.  Ms. Dina, a
51-year-old retired mortician, has penned such songs as
"Menopause":
        "Hit my son during my hot flash
         for pointing out my new moustache
         The house is a wreck and I don't care
         I just sit around in men's underwear."
Another of her downbeat ditties:
        "Aches, pains, capital gains
         We're senior citizens in the slow lane
         Life gets nutso, sometimes it's the pits
         When we see our friends' names in the obits."

        Guitarist Danny Walters, 74, may be responsible for the
polka sound -- he spent 20 years as music arranger for Lawrence
Welk.  Mr. Walters, who says he only recently discovered the
distortion button on his guitar amp, performs in a jacket with
a patch of heavy-metal band Megadeath.
        Cloaked in a leather jacket, with rhinestones proclaiming
that "Elvis Lives," drummer Gene Costa, also 74, hardly seems
like a punk rocker. Mr. Costa, a retired court reporter, didn't
pick up the drums until after his 60th birthday.  Keyboardist
Gavin Wieser, at 48, is the baby of the group.
         In high hopes, the Sun City troupe has put together and
sent off to record companies a demo tape with seven original
tunes.  And like any new band, they are dreaming of national
exposure.  "We would love to tour, if we could find a sponser to
back us," Ms. Dina said.  "I figure that Geritol would be a natural."
        Of course, punk rockers rehearsing in a retirement community
have special constraints. "We generally have to quit by 9 p.m.,"
Ms. Dina says.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        I saw these dudes on TV and they really do play punk rock.  The
        polka bit is a canard.

Subj:   Veeck's Rules

The following list of Bill Veeck's 12 commandments appeared in the
Boston Globe.  They may be relevant outside baseball.

1.  Take your work very seriously.  Go for broke and give it your all.

2.  Never ever take yourself seriously.

3.  Find yourself an alter ego and bond with him for the rest of your
    professional life.  [I dunno what this means, either.--grs]

4.  Surround yourself with similarly dedicated soulmates, free spirits of
    whom you can ask why and why not.  And who can ask the same thing of you.

5.  In your hiring, be color-blind, gender-blnd, age- and experience-blind.
    You never work for Bill Veeck.  You work with him.

6.  If you're a president, owner, or operator, attend every home game and
    you never leave until the last out.

7.  Answer all your mail; you might learn something.

8.  Listen and be available to your fans.

9.  Enjoy and respect the members of the media, the stimulation and the
    challenge.  The "them against us" mentality should exist only between
    the two teams on the field.

10. Create an aura in your city.  Make people understand that unless they
    come to the ballpark, they will miss something.

11. If you don't think a promotion is fun, don't do it.  Never insult your fans.

12. Don't miss the essence of what is happening at the moment. Let it
    happen.  Cherish the moment and commit it to your memory.

Tom,

I got a real kick out of the attached WSJ article.  I think `Those

_A Scud It's Not, But the Trebuchet Hurls a Mean Piano_

Giant Medieval War Machine Is Wowing British Farmers And Scaring the
Sheep

By Glynn Mapes, Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal

ACTON ROUND, England--With surprising grace, the grand piano sails
through the sky a hundred feet above a pasture here, finally returning
to earth in a fortissimo explosion of wood chunks, ivory keys and
piano wire.

Nor is the piano the strangest thing to startle the grazing sheep
this Sunday morning.  A few minutes later, a car soars by - a 1975
blue two-door Hillman, to be exact - following the same flight path
and meeting the same loud fate.  Pigs fly here, too.  In recent
months, many dead 500-pound sows (two of them wearing parachutes) have
passed overhead, as has the occasional dead horse.

It's the work of Hew Kennedy's medieval siege engine, a four story
tall, 30 ton behemoth that's the talk of bucolic Shropshire, 140 miles
northwest of London.  In ancient times, such war machines were dreaded
instruments of destruction, flinging huge missiles, including
plague-ridden horses, over the walls of besieged castles.  Only one
full-sized one exists today, designed and built by Mr. Kennedy, a
wealthy landowner, inventor, military historian and - need it be said?
- full-blown eccentric.

A Pagoda, Too

At Acton, Round Hall, Mr. Kennedy's handsome Georgian manor house here,
one enters the bizarre world of a P. G. Wodehouse novel.  A stuffed
baboon hangs from the dining room chandelier (``Shot it in Africa.
Nowhere else to put it,'' Mr. Kennedy explains).  Lining the walls are
dozens of halberds and suits of armor.  A full suit of Indian elephant
armor, rebuilt by Mr. Kennedy, shimmers resplendently on an
elephant-sized frame.  In the garden outside stands a 50-foot-high
Chinese pagoda.

Capping this scene, atop a hill on the other side of the 620-acre
Kennedy estate, is the siege engine, punctuating the skyline like an
oil derrick.  Known by its 14th-century French name, trebuchet
(pronounced tray-boo-shay), it's not to be confused with a catapult, a
much smaller device that throws rocks with a spoon-like arm propelled
by twisted ropes or animal gut.

Mr. Kennedy, a burly, energetic 52-year-old, and Richard Barr, his
46-year-old neighbor and partner, have spent a year and #10,000
($17,000) assembling the trebuchet.  They have worked from ancient
texts, some in Latin, and crude wood-block engravings of siege
weaponry.

The big question is why?

Mr. Kennedy looks puzzled, as if the thought hadn't occurred to him
before.  ``Well why not?  It's bloody good fun!'' he finally exclaims.
When pressed, he adds that for several hundred years, military
technicians have been trying fruitlessly to  reconstruct a working
trebuchet.  Cortez built one for the siege of Mexico City.  On its
first shot, it flung a huge boulder straight up - and then straight
down, demolishing the machine.  In 1851, Napoleon III had a go at it,
as an academic exercise.  His trebuchet was poorly balanced and barely
managed to hurl the missiles - backward.  ``Ours works a hell of a lot
better than the Frogs', which is a satisfaction,'' Mr. Kennedy says
with relish.

How it works seems simple enough.  The heart of the siege engine is a
three-ton, 60-foot tapered beam made from laminated wood.  It's
pivoted near the heavy end, to which is attached a weight box filled
with 5= tons of steel bar.  Two huge A-frames made from
lashed-together tree trunks support a steel axle, around which the
beam pivots.  When the machine is at rest, the beam is vertical,
slender end at the top and weight box just clearing the ground.

When launch time comes, a farm tractor cocks the trebuchet, slowly
hauling the slender end of the beam down and the weighted end up.
Several dozen nervous sheep, hearing the tractor and knowing what
comes next, make a break for the far side of the pasture.  A crowd of
60 friends and neighbors buzzes with anticipation as a 30-foot,
steel-cable sling is attached - one end to the slender end of the beam
and the other to the projectile, in this case a grand piano (purchased
by the truckload from a junk dealer).

``If you see the missile coming toward you, simply step aside,'' Mr.
Kennedy shouts to the onlookers.

Then, with a great groaning, the beam is let go.  As the counterweight
plummets, the piano in its sling whips through an enormous arc, up and
over the top of the trebuchet and down the pasture, a flight of 125
yards.  The record for pianos is 151 yards (an upright model, with
less wind resistance).  A 112 pound iron weight made it 235 yards.
Dead hogs go for about 175 yards, and horses 100 yards; the field is
cratered with the graves of the beasts, buried by a backhoe where they
landed.

Mr. Kennedy has been studying and writing about ancient engines of war
since his days at Sandhurst, Britain's military academy, some 30 years
ago.  But what spurred him to build one was, as he puts it, ``my
nutter cousin'' in Northumberland, who put together a pint-sized
trebuchet for a county fair.  The device hurled porcelain toilets
soaked in gasoline and set afire.  A local paper described the event
under the headline ``Those Magnificent Men and Their Flaming
Latrines.''

Building a full-sized siege engine is a more daunting task.  Mr.
Kennedy believes that dead horses are the key.  That's because
engravings usually depict the trebuchet hurling boulders, and there is
no way to determine what the rocks weigh, or the counterweight
necessary to fling them.  But a few drawings show dead horses being
loaded onto trebuchets, putrid animals being an early form of
biological warfare.  Since horses weigh now what they did in the
1300s, the engineering calculations followed easily.

One thing has frustrated Mr. Kennedy and his partner:  They haven't
found any commercial value to the trebuchet.  Says a neighbor helping
to carry the piano to the trebuchet, ``Too bad Hew can't make the
transition between building this marvelous machine and making any
money out of it.''

It's not for lack of trying.  Last year Mr. Kennedy walked onto the
English set of the Kevin Costner Robin Hood movie, volunteering his
trebuchet for the scene where Robin and his sidekick are catapulted
over a wall.  ``The directors insisted on something made out of
plastic and cardboard,'' he recalls with distaste.  ``Nobody cares
about correctness these days.''

More recently, he has been approached by an entrepreneur who wants to
bus tourists up from London to see cars and pigs fly through the air.
So far, that's come to naught.

Mr. Kennedy looks to the U.S. as his best chance of getting part of
his investment back: A theme park could commission him to build an
even bigger trebuchet that could throw U.S.-sized cars into the sky.
``Its an amusement in America to smash up motor cars, isn't it?'' he
inquires hopefully.

Finally, there's the prospect of flinging a man into space - a living
man, that it.  This isn't a new idea, Mr. Kennedy points out:
Trebuchets were often used to fling ambassadors and prisoners of war
back over castle walls, a sure way to demoralize the opposition.

Some English sports parachutists think they can throw a man in the air
*and* bring him down alive.  In a series of experiments on Mr.
Kennedy's machine, they've thrown several man-sized logs and two
quarter-tone dead pigs into the air; one of the pigs parachuted gently
back to earth, the other landed rather more forcefully.

Trouble is, an accelerometer carried inside the logs recorded a
centrifugal force during the launch of as much as 20 Gs (the actual
acceleration was zero to 90 miles per hour in 1.5 seconds). Scientists
are divided over whether a man can stand that many Gs for more that a
second or two before his blood vessels burst.

The parachutists are nonetheless enthusiastic.  But Mr. Kennedy thinks
the idea may only be pie in the sky.

``It would be splendid to throw a bloke, really splendid,'' he says
wistfully.  ``He'd float down fine.  But he'd float down dead.''

I found this in among some old papers.  The original is blurry, in
purple mimeo ink, on white paper with an Atlantic Duplicator watermark.
I don't remember it from my own junior high days, but the categories are
certainly consistent with my long-since shredded memories of that Little
Bit o' Hell on Earth.

Some items (eg. 8, 12, 17, 24) apparently involve the strategic movement
of large numbers of recalcitrant anarchists out of the cafeteria and
then back into the school; and I seem to remember 15 daily minutes of
post-lunch "no horseplay" in an exercise yard.  On purely internal
evidence, I'd have to say this was from my own beloved Lincoln Jr H.S.

Not high school, certainly -- even in those halcyon days, no HS
detention list would have omitted smoking as a detainable offense.
(Now, of course, the gradeschools are probably frisking for assault
rifles.)

I don't remember when I picked this up, but I wish I'd made better use
of it back then as a handy checklist.  There are whole categories of
offense that I never considered.  If I'd put my mind to it, I could've
easily completed the whole list is a few months time, and gotten it
autographed by the Asst. Principal.  (Youth is wasted on the young.)

Under the heading of, "They only come out at night..."

    I was watching TV at about 3 a.m. (my eyes had already turned square) when
one of these 30 minute ad's came on for something called the "FLOWBEE".  The
FLOWBEE is an attachment for your canister or shop vacuum that cuts hair.  How
you may ask?  Part of the airflow into the vacuum spins a small turbine.  This
in turn rotates a set of cutters.  The other part of the airflow sucks your hair
up into these cutters.  You set the length of hair to be cut by using spacer
tubes.  The cut hair gets sucked up into the vacuum (to be used by TV Voodoo
Evangelists, I suspect).
    This was very odd to watch.  Embedded into this commercial was a video this
guy had shot at a trade show, of people getting their hair cut by this thing.
I'm not sure Firesign Theatre ever got this strange.  The "inventor" said he
was working on an attachment for "Afro" hair.  I think what raised this to the
truly mondo weird and surreal were the occasional nods to more mainstream
reality.  It added a nice contrast.

On the David Lynch/Twin Peaks weirdness scale (-5 to +5) I'd rate this a 2.5.
Tighter editing and a little higher production values could of turned this into
a cult classic.

There is an official State of New Hampshire highway sign on route 93 northbound
somewhere around Hookset that I saw for the first time this weekend.  About a

too late.  Saw it again yesterday.  I still don't know what it means exactly,

It's on the same posts as a seatbelt law sign, so I guess putting `Live Free
