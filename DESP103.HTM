Subject: I GOT A RAINBOW ROUND MY SHOULDER

Thanks to all the Desperadim who responded to my appeal for a noble software
engineer to help a quadriplegic Rainbow customer who can only use one key at
a time. SHIFT and CONTROL functions were beyond her capabilities. Very shortly
after DESPERADO #1090 appeared, there was a mighty thunder of hooves and
VIKING::HORTON pulled up on a late-model white horse. He had immediately
implementable ideas on the SHIFT side, as did several other readers, but
I think it was the CONTROL problem that really intrigued him. By the end of
the week, he had written a program that made the SHIFT and CONTROL keys affect
the next key pressed. He installed it along with CP/M on a disk which is in
Laura Tucker's drive even as we speak.

There's a lot more to the story, which continues to unfold. I wanted to get
the word on the electronic street. Thank you again for sharing your ideas with
me. If you know anyone else who needs this problem solved, put them in touch
with Ken Horton. He's with the Rainbow Group,  and he is a star in my book.

Subject: Project Rainbow

 After reading the submission to Desperado on Project Rainbow, I thought that
I should make an addition to it. Wayne Ledder, VIKING::LEDDER, also provided
assistance in being able to come up with a resolution to Project Rainbow.
Between us we came up with different methods to implement it. Wayne came up
with an idea which would not require changes to the system. Upon booting the
system, an application would be run which would change the operation of the
SHIFT and CONTROL keys. From there I went off to give it a try it and get
together a package that could be delivered to Laura.

 Basically what it does is programs the keyboard so that the SHIFT and CONTROL
keys will send the keycode only when it is depressed, so that when the next
key is pressed it looks as though SHIFT or CONTROL is still pressed. When the
key is released it will then release the SHIFT or CONTROL key. SHIFT/CONTROL
combinations will also work if they are needed.

Subject: I wonder if KO would make a good Darth Vader...

In a recent trip to a video-gaming palace in Nashua on DW highway I saw an
intriguing game called Major Havoc.

I lost a dollar in tokens on the silly machine and was about to leave when I
noticed the story-line for the game beginning to scroll across the screen.

It seems that Major Havoc is one of the few survivors of the invasion
by the VAXxian Empire.  Your duty as Major Havoc is to destroy the VAXxian
robot controlled bases, until you ultimately defeat the VAXxians on their home
planet of Maynard.

It seems that DECman is being considerably out-classed.

-Need I mention that the game is put out by Atari?

Subject: Birds in the Mill

When I came to The Mill over 3 years ago (a surprising enough occurence,
since upon interviewing here I swore I'd never work in a dungeon like
this) I experienced my first bird in the Mill down on 5-2 before it was
renovated.  First suspicions turned it into a bat, giving credence to
the dungeon belief.  But after watching it for a good 10 minutes I came
to see it was a sparrow or a starling (an ornithologist I'm not).

I called what was then Plant Engineering and, after haggling for a bit,
they sent someone to check it out.  He stood by my desk, stared up at
the terrified little thing that darted among the a/c units, and nodded.
"Yup.  That's a bird all right...." and he left.

The bird stayed where he was the rest of the day.  I put crackers on top
of my manager's partition, hoping to at least make amends to the bird.
The partitions down on 5-2 were the ugly board kind but at least well over
6 or 7 feet in height.  Still, the crackers were gone and I never figured
out if the bird got them or if JET found them first and threw them away.

Now I do development and support for the Facilities organization (including
Plant Engineering) and they respond to bird reports under dire threat of
getting the plug pulled on their software.

Power helps.

Well, since I had such great luck finding the science fiction story I was
looking for (it was "IN THE BONE" by Gordon R. Dickson in a collection entitled
"ANCIENT MY ENEMY") I thought I'd try for a real hard one:

When I was knee high to a grasshopper my aunt (who was a systems analyst before
anyone thought they knew what that meant) gave me my first computer. It was a
3 bit machine (yes 3 bit!) called a DIGICOMP-I and was made by Edmund Scientific
It was made out of read and white plastic, hand operated clock and could be
programmed to count, add, etc. I WANT ONE!!!!! Edmund no longer makes or stocks
the beast, and no one seems to know what I'm talking about. If anyone has one of
these things floating around in their attic, please let me know. I've been trying
to locate one for a few years now at garage sales, but have had no luck.

I don't know if he'll appreciate my telling this one, but MARVIN::GASCOIGNE
related to me a true "in the business too long" adventure.  This one would
presuppose acquaintance with 8080 or similar assembler syntax; it seems he
was tootling down the motorway when he almost collided with the car in front
of him because he was trying to render into decimal the legend on the licence
plate it bore, which read:

Subject: Been here too long?

This is a management version of the being in this business too long blues:

Last summer I was inquiring of one of the engineers that works for
me the reason for a certain bug in a piece of field test software.
The answer was that some buffer or other was too short by 1024 bytes.
My response, without hesitation, was "OK, fine."  It occurred to
me not long afterward that if he had said that something was off
by 1000 bytes I would not have been nearly as understanding and
I would have wondered to myself about this person's skill level.

But I have come to accept all powers of 2 as magic numbers.  In this
business any power of 2 seems to explain anything.  If your indirect
address is off by 1024 or 512 bytes, that's understandable.  But if
it's off by 1020, that's just stupid.

I tried using this once on my management (something about slipping
by 32 days), but it didn't work.

Glad to read about that fellow balancing his checkbook in hex...when I was a

hydraulics lab, I got to the point where I was toggling in the dozen-or-so
words of octal to start up the paper-tape bootstrap purely from memory, and I
began to fear I'd be balancing my checkbook in octal. Always teased myself with
the question of whether doing so would be inflationary or deflationary.

"Erst kommt das Fressen, dann kommt die Moral" sounds like a
Salvation Army soup kitchen (in reverse).  I don't like your
translation "and then we'll be good" -- I'd say, "food first,
morals later."

In the "Brecht on Brecht" recording, there is the story about
Herr Kliener (right spelling?) who was arrested and brought
to trial.  The judge asked "Do you want the Civil oath or the
Religious oath?"  "I want a job," he replied.

I do not pretend to speak fluent German, but it has been a sometime hobby
with me.  I believe the essence of these pithy German words is that man
cannot be human until he is fed.  Of course, lack of food could be replaced
with cold, sickness, thirst, fear.

The key to this interpretation is that "das Fressen" is feed, or the act
of feeding, for animals, while "die Moral, is something the belongs to
humans.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Dick Day's interpretation is good-hearted.  Brecht took a harsher
view.  The song in the Three-penny Opera from which the quote comes is
called 'Ballad About the Question "What Keeps a Man Alive?"'  MacHeath
(the well-known Mack the Knife) has just pronounced 'First comes the
grub, the come the morals' (as my libretto translates it) and Jenny
(the equally well-known Lotte Lenya) asks, 'What keeps a man alive?'
Mackie Messer (Mack the K.) replies (in song):

        What keeps a man alive?  He keeps alive by every hour
        Torturing, stripping, attacking, throttling, and devouring
                his fellow men.
        A man keeps alive by completely
        Being able to forget that he's a human being too.

I'll repeat that for our German audience:

        Denn wovon lebt der Mensch?  In dem er stuendlich
        Den Menschen peinigt, auszieht, anfaellt, abuwuergt und
                frisst.
        Nur dadurch lebt der Mensch, dass er so gruendlich
        Vergessen kann, dass er ein Mensch doch ist.

Brecht, a communist, had capitalism in mind when he wrote those lines,
but they seem to apply equally well (or better) to communism.  But the
Three-Penny Opera is a wonderful piece, whatever your politics.  The
very last lines of the play are my very favorite Brecht lines (sung to
the tune of 'Mack the Knife'):

        Denn die einen sind im Dunkeln
        Und die andern sind im Licht.
        Und man siehet die im Lichte
        Die im Dunkeln sieht man nicht.

        For the ones they are in darkness
        And the others are in light.
        And you see the ones in brightness
        Those in darkness drop from sight.

That means it's hard to see the poor people, even if you're a
communist.

Ah, well, speaking of communists, back to capitalism and the next
contribution, from the ZK librarian.

Subject: A FINAL WORD ON SELLING TECHNOLOGY TO THE RUSSKIES

The FEB/MAR 84 issue of Technology Review has a very interesting
article by Marshall Goldman called "Why Not Sell Technology to the
Russians?"

He makes two very good points on why this is a good idea.  First, that
because of a level of economic interdependence, trading partners are
less likely to nuke one another.  Secondly, he shows evidence that the
Soviets have consistently underutilized the Western technology that
they've already acquired.  For example, they will often buy Western
equipment and then prevent the vendor access to it for service (for
security reasons, of course).  Picture a VAX somewhere in Siberia with
no customer support. Better yet, picture one in Digital with no
customer support!

Even their use of "reverse engineering" in duplicating Western
technology is often ineffective.  Once the product has been
"re-invented" the lack of management incentives in the production
process hampers its manufacture. Add to that all the ideosyncrasies of
the Russian political and economic beauracracy and you can see how it
might even be counterproductive for the Soviets to fiddle with our
technology.

I've heard that there are hundreds of PDP-11 "lookalikes" in the
Soviet Union.  Who knows?  They may be ready for the migration to VAX.
Think of the sales potential!

By the way, the article is in the ZK Library if anyone's
interested....

Subject: Batch Mail

I can't believe that you don't know about BATCHMAIL, an absolutely necessary
com file to forward mail.  This com file sets up batch jobs to send your
piece of mail to everyone on the distribution list, regardless of whether
their node is currently accessible or not.  If it gets an error sending to
one or more people, it re-queues another job to try again in another hour.
Only some particularly severe errors will keep it from trying again.

To use BATCHMAIL, in SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM add

        define/system   MAIL$BMCOMFILE  SYS$SYSTEM:BATCHMAIL.COM
        define/system   MAIL$QUEUE      LOW$BATCH

or whatever your lowest priority batch-queue is called.

In your individual LOGIN.COM file,  add

Subject: RE: MAIL systems

Sorry Tom, but you're still wrong. Although neither V3 VMSmail nor V4
VMSmail can do what I believe you mean by "store and forward", DECmail-11
(nee' DCEmail/RSTS, nee' RSTS MAIL) does both what you want and true
store and forward via the message router. This may or may not make you
a triangular man-hole cover.

From what you say here (and once in person) I believe that what you mean
by store and forward is to keep track of which people in the TO list didn't
get the message, and keep retrying. This DECmail-11 has had since it
changed from an in-house hack to a product. Now that it has become
DECmail-11 (soon to be availbale on RSX), it also supports the message
router as a second transport mechanism. This gives it real store and
forward where it is not required that a continuous path exist from sender
to receiver. Rather the message can be stored at an intermediate node
and later forwarded to the destination node even if it comes on-line
while the sender is off the air.

Interestingly it also has more-or-less the functions suggested by
Chris Schuetz in that if you issue a SET AUTO/LOG command, it will
inform you that it has succeeded in send the message to each recipient
as that happens. If you have also SET AUTO/QUEUE, it will then submit
a batch job to retry for all the failures. This is basically Chris's
SEND/ACK. It also has a LIST/[BEFORE, AFTER, SINCE, UNTIL] = [date,
TODAY, YESTERDAY, TOMORROW] command which also accepts things like
YESTERDAY-10. For those of you who prefer the DIRECTORY vrb to LIST
there is a synonym feature that allows you to define new verbs.
(Myself I leave I use LIST for listing messages and have defined
DIR*ECTORY (the * is the abbreviation point) to be LIST FILES, which
makes it act like the DCL DIRECTORY command, which along with my
definition of TYPE that if I forget I'm in mail and type TYPE or
DIRECTORY it works.

Oh, yes and although it has an .INI file capability, few people have
.INI files because if you do one of the SET commands listed above it
remembers your preferences from one invocation to the next, so the
only thing you have to put in the .INI file is commands you want issued
on startup like a LIST/NEW, to see a listing of new mail.

I could go on and on as the DECmail-11 interface is the richest in DEC
excepting possibly the -20s MS, which is still an in-house hack, but
why bother teasing all of youse guys what don't got it. (If I sound
like the proud father it's cause DECmail-11 is a direct descendant
(via 2 total re-writes) of the RSTS mail system I started in 1975.
Turning it over to Mark Goodrich 5 years ago was one of the best things
I ever did.)

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Okay, I stand corrected (where I was wrong), but the RSX system I love
does all this stuff without my having to tell it, and it tells me when
a message was *not* received.  Furthermore, it does one send per node,
no matter how many recipients there are, while other mailers do one
send per recipient.

Maybe some one will write me a nice, nonpartisan description of all
the mails we have, what they do, and which ones we sell (and why) or
don't sell (and why).  Remember, I said nonpartisan.  Choice of mail
is almost as profound a passion as choosing between EMACS and TECO.
See next, for instance.

SUBJ:   Corporate Mail rampage/temper tantrum

I seldom get trully emotional about the features of one product/tool
over another, but the recent DESPERADO discussions on various mail
systems has touched a very sensitive spot with me.  I trully believe
that DECmail is the wrong electronic mail system for Digital to market.
This memo is aimed at those touting the fantastic store and forward
features of MTS, along with the user interface and other such wonderful
stuff.  I do not expect that my aim will be accurate to the extent of
changing the product which actually goes to hapless customers, but I
want my cries to be heard.

Please be reminded that the main purpose of any electronic mail is to
get the message to the recipiant in a timely fashion.  Although all
the mail systems I know of in the corporation have some problems, the
MTS system is my least favorite.  MTS super-routing has been known to get a
a message from Marlboro to Littleton in only a week and a half.  VMS mail got
a message to the same person, in the same facility, using similar
DECNet routing in a couple of minutes.  If an intervening node were
down, I would probably use NMAIL, which will keep trying until the
node(s) are reachable.  MTS does store and forward - so what?  As long
as I have NMAIL, which resubmits periodically, I do not care if it
stays on my node....and if it is still queued on my local node, I can
check the status at will - something I cannot do with DECmail using the
MTS router.

DECmail also shows poor performance locally.  Someone a couple of offices
down from me sent a memo to our whole group - all of whom reside on the same
node.  The person next door received her message 2 hours before I did.
I receive MTS messages containing requests and approvals for presentations
which happened yesterday.

The notification of errors is untranslatable garbage, not adhereing to VMS
normal message text, and not up to corporate snuff for "user friendly"
(whatever that is) either.  This is nothing like the very complicated
"node unreachable" message I get from the VMS mail.

If I am using a "tied" account, I cannot import files from other directories to
edit or send or anything.  I also must use the DECmail editor (which is EDT
with a WPS interface forced upon the user), and cannot re-implement my own
edtini file, since that constitutes importing a file.

The DECmail (WPS) editor is not only clumsy, but does not take advantage of the
secondary keypad - I know all you WPS fans are shouting "NOT TRUE!!!", but
I maintain that any use of a secondary keypad which requires two hands to
operate is defeating the purpose.  (for instance, in order to insert a command
from command mode when I am in insert mode, I must type the "gold" key, then
the "[" key.  And to end my editting session, I must type the "gold" key, then
the "f" key.)

Obviously, I am not enamoured with  DECmail or ALL-IN-ONE or the message
router.  I much prefer to use VAX mail, or NMAIL, or RSX mail.  Unfortunately,
many of the people with whom I must communicate do not have access to normal
VMS accounts, and I must read my mail, edit it and forward it on the MTS
account set up for me.

I freely admit that VMS mail and NMAIL do not contain all the answers.  It
might be unreasonable to expect the salesforce, AMCs or product line people
to learn to use normal VMS mail syntax. However, the ability to use the editor
of thier choice,  and the ability to get immediate (seconds if the person and
remote node are on line) responses from recipiants of thier inquiries, and
the ability to reach anyone in the corporation at almost any time, might
permit them to overcome thier learning disabilities.  Please remember,
that even product managers are capable of learning SOME technical infor-
mation.  The VMS interface is JUST AS EASY TO LEARN as DECmail.

The ONLY advantage which DECmail (or MTS or whatever) seems to have over
the normal VMS mail systems is the ability to find a person by specifying
the facility in which they reside as opposed to requiring a nodename.
(it does not know how to deal with two people with the same name in
the same facility, though).  Even then, I would prefer all folks to be
registered in ELF - its quite adequate for that purpose the purpose of
finding people (when they have the correct information in ELF, that is).

Some people think the header information and distribution list information
is worth having to put up with all that other stuff - I disagree, since
a good EDTINI file could perform the same tasks, exclusive of things
like badge numbers, etc..., which I don't care about anyway.

I have only one thing to add to my rampage - WHY DO WE HAVE TO USE MTS???!!!

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Wow!  I never even heard of MTS.  What is it?  Do you have to use it,
Madeline?  That's why I want that nice rundown on mail.

Next mail from me, news from Japan from DEC's quality guru, plus the
usual gang of idiocy.

Have a nice dream.
