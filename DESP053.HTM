For some strange reason, citizens of the USA have great difficulty with
my name.  I am always asked to spell it on the phone, even though I say it's
spelt "as it sounds".  In San Diego (ah, happy days!) the girl at the front
desk couldn't find my reservation, but remembered my name "because it was
kinda cute", and I was given a room on the poolside (temp was 85 deg.).
Up in the mountains, driving north to LA via Palomar, I ordered a moon-burger
(yes, really) in the only restaurant (it was a health-food place: I could
tell because there were no ashtrays), and Jim-Bob thought I "was putting him
on, 'cos people give all sorts of weird names when ordering".

My latest proud acquisition, is a shirt returned from the laundry at my
hotel in Merrimack:  In indelible ink on the inside of the collar is an
abbreviation of my name

The first time I had any dealings with VOGON::GOODENOUGH, I asked if
Goodenough was a name or a point of view.

By the way, is anyone familiar with the theory that we are approaching
a family name shortage?  It seems I've seen some statement that
mathematics dictates fewer and fewer family names as the years go by
because (some) women give up their family names.  There are more
Parmenters than I would believe - even another at DEC - and
considering all the strange names out there - Velpo Rainwater springs
to mind - it seems unlikely that we should be facing a surname gap,
but ...

Have you noticed that there have been fewer tornados since the big
rush of tornados in 1974?  Ever since the oil crisis and the reduction
in driving...

Lends credence to one of the crazy theories on the supposed increase
in the number of tornados.  (The real reason for the increase is
probably just more people and better and faster reporting mechanisms,
just like VD.)  But back in '74, there was this theory going around
that suggested that tornados were being helped along by automobile
traffic.  You may know that in the Northern Hemisphere, tornados
rotate counter clockwise, just like water going down a drain.  The
theory states that automobiles travelling on the right, passing
automobiles on their left, helps to increase the amount of air that is
moving counter clockwise.  This forms wombs for tornados.

So we should drive on the left north of the Equator, and on the right
only south of the Equator!

(Could this be why there are no tornados in the U.K.?)

Many of your readers have acknowledged their attendence at a solar eclipse,
and have gone on to explain in detail what happened at their last tornado.

I was fortunate enough to be on Prince Edward Island in Nova Scotia in 1972
during a solar eclipse.  Prince Edward Island was in the area affording the
longest totality.  When we arrived on the island we were directed to a field
for amateurs, as opposed to the field for scientists, which was on the other
side of the island.  We wound up with about 150 other people who had large
telescopes and listened to the GMT beeps on the SW band.  All I had was my
camera, a rented lens and some taped-on filters to rip off when the time
(totality) came.

Totality was amazing.  Late dusk arrived in only a few seconds.  The birds
and grasshoppers and crickets started singing, loud enough to drown out the
GMT beeps.  It was an eerie sensation.  Totality lasted about three minutes.
After totality there was a brief moment of silence and then everyone started
applauding.  No encore though.  Also no blades of grass driven through
pieces of plywood.

I was on Martha's Vineyard for the 1972 eclipse.  It was about 98%
there.  When the sun finally disappeared we were all seized with
atavistic yearnings and started leaping and yelling.  Fortunately,
this worked and the sun returned unharmed.

instrument so  that  his  10  year  old  son,  Louis,  could
understand it.

This is the 10th anniversary of the GROTON THEATRE, formerly
known as the GROTON COMMUNITY THEATRE. The first production by
this theatre group (in 1973) was BLACK COMEDY, and they are
producing it a second time to mark this auspicious event!

Almost all the action in this comedy takes place in the dark -
but, don't worry, in order that the audience may see what's
going on, they reverse light and dark, so that when the stage
is illuminated and the audience can see, the action is really
taking place in the 'dark', and vice versa!

Performance dates and times are shown below. Note that ticket
prices are $5 for all performances, and the 10th Anniversary
Celebration Champagne Party on Saturday March 5th at 7 pm is
$5 per person in addition to the performance ticket price.

Wine and cheese will be served on stage after every performance!

Friday,   March 11th at 8.00 pm
Saturday, March 12th at 8.00 pm

Subject: STRATUS fault tolerant systems.

Ever heard of STRATUS COMPUTERS?  You will.  They build fault-tolerant
machines, and love to compete head-on with Tandem.

(Heard at the New England Computer Society meeting 2 March 83).

Bob Freiburghouse (yes, Mr. Multics, Mr. Get-Rich-Selling-PL/I-Compilers)
spoke last night to NECS about STRATUS computers.  He is now the VP of
Software Engineering there.

STRATUS was founded in 1980, shipped its first system in March 1981, and
has installed 40 systems since then.  The "processing units" go for
$150-250K, he says, plus peripherals.  Do the arithmetic yourself: that's
something like $5-10M in the first two years of sales.  Not bad for a
startup company only three years old.

Their systems do what they call "continuous processing."  He says they
have trademarked that term.  Their goal is that no single point hardware
failure (within some time interval) will take down the system.  They have
actually achieved this goal by throwing huge gobs of hardware at the
problem.  Fortunately, with microprocessors as cheap as they are these
days, the solution is economical.

What the programmer of one of these systems sees is a very normal
(VMS-like, he says) system that just won't quit.  It looks like a
Motorola 68000 system, 8 MHz with no wait states, lots of memory,
paging, good I/O system, etc.  No special programming style.

The system is *entirely* duplicated in hardware.  Each box has two buses,
with identical sets of hardware on each bus.  Each bus contains
processors, disk controllers, terminal controllers, memories, etc.
Each board and its "partner" on the other bus do the same things in
lockstep (with one exception which I will get to).  The two buses are
even powered by separate power supplies, and cooled by separate fans.

But wait!  You haven't heard the clever part.   Each board has built-in
error detection that operates on every single bus access.  If the board
thinks that what it wants to put on the bus may be bad, it just shuts up.
Its partner on the other bus continues to operate, and, since they were
doing the same work, things continue to run.

How does a board detect that it might be failing?  Simple.  The *board*
has two of everything on it, with comparison logic that fondles
everything out to the bus.  If the two halves of the board disagree about
what to say to the system bus, then the board declares itself bad.  This
means that every processor board actually contains two processors; every
disk controller board contains two disk controllers; etc.  The only thing
on the board that is not duplicated is the comparator that checks for
health, and they have a clever way to deal with that, too (later).

Sound expensive?  Not very.  The processors are M68000s (about $100),
and all the peripheral controllers are built from Z80s (about $3).

But wait!  There's more.  The system is demand paged, as all reasonable
medium size computers should be.  But, you say, the M68000 can't handle
paging, because it doesn't have enough state information to back up the
instruction.  Right.  That's why there are *two* 68000s, one running one
instruction behind the other.

When the first processor (called "user") takes a page fault, the
second one (called "exec") stores its state, gets the page, remaps
memory, and restarts the first one at the right place. (Diabolical.  I
heard rumors about this two years ago, but did not hear the company
name with the idea.)  For more nearly normal execution, the exec
processor is used to execute most of the I/O system for the user
processor, to provide some additional overlap.  (The terms "user" and
"exec" explicitly do *not* refer to the user/supervisor modes of
execution in the 68000.)

Now, let's add this up.  There are two buses, each containing a processor
board.  Each board contains two independent halves.  Each half actually
contains two microprocessors.  That's eight machines in one box, all
executing in lockstep.  Cute.

Peripherals are handled slightly differently.  The operating system
treats disks and terminals as special cases.  Any disk write is done to
*both* disk controllers, one on each bus, to shadow the disks by volume
(with bad block remapping).  Reads are done from the least busy disk.  If
a disk is down for a while, it is reintegrated by writing the journal if
it is short enough, or by recopying the volume (slowly or quickly, your
choice).

Terminal controllers are duplicated, too, right up to the EIA link, with
a failover switch under software control.

Now, when a processor fails, it interrupts the other one.  The other one
loads diagnostics in it and runs them to look for soft errors.  If the
error appears to have been soft, it will put the processor back in
service, resynchronizing it with its partner.  If at some point the error
log indicates too many soft errors, the processor is taken out of service
permanently.

Let's see, there's one more failure to look for.  If a bus should fail,
e.g., some bus driver circuit gets stuck on or off, then the memory
controllers sense this and take the entire bus out of service.  This is
serious, but rare, and of course, you still have one good one to run on.
The memories, of course, have fairly standard ECC, one-bit correction
and two-bit error detection.

What about the non-duplicated comparator logic on each board?  Suppose
the comparator is the failure.  Case 1: if the comparator incorrectly
indicates an error, then an otherwise good board is taken out of service.
No problem.  There is always another.  Case 2: if the comparator fails to
detect an error, then there is a potential problem.  To detect this, the
system regularly runs special diagnostics that deliberately cause errors.
If any board fails to report an error on one of these tests, then it is
taken out of service.  The system manager gets to choose how often to run
these tests.  Most sites do it about once a day (seems rather infrequent
to me).

What happens when something does fail?  Right now, the customer gets a
message, calls STRATUS in Natick, Mass., and gets a new board in the
mail.  The entire system is designed to permit board replacement while
running, and customers do it themselves.  It is said not to require any
expertise at all.

They are about to install their phone-in service center, where the
remaining parts of the machine will dial directly to STRATUS and describe
the failure, including board serial numbers and so forth, and STRATUS
will send out a board for replacement, all untouched by human hands.
He doesn't expect the phone to be busy very often, because the MTBF on
their processor boards is like one year.

[Aside to Peter Christy and Ed Marison: remember Peter's talk about six
years ago on his dream machine?  Sounds like STRATUS has built the beast.]

If you really, really want to run continuously, you should buy an
uninterruptible power system (UPS) for the machine(s) and terminals.
STRATUS doesn't supply that, but they do have battery backup to
survive short power failures.

What software do you get on one of these things?

        A VMS-like virtual operating system, VOS.
        PL/I, FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL
        symbolic debugger for all languages
        screen formatting package
        transaction processing system
        X.25 and 3270 communications
        ISAM, record locking, recovery, distributed updates synchronized
        DBMS soon ("this year")

All written in PL/I, of course.  He says it was about 60 man-years.  That
sounds too low by a factor of about three to me, but that's what the man
said.

What did I forget to mention?  Pages are 4K bytes.  The operating system
is not paged, requires 2MB.  And, oh, yes, the LAN.

These machines are all clustered, if you can afford it, on a proprietary
local area network, duplicated of course, 1.4Mbyte/sec on each channel
(hardware capacity), 1500 feet without repeaters.  It is built into the
operating system, and all devices in the net can be shared.  It's done as
a star configuration, but of course the hub is duplicated.  Quote: "If
you run over one of the hubs with a tractor, well, it slows down a
little."

Not bad stuff, all in all.  They deserve to make a mint if it's half as
good as it sounds.
