        News story of the century, buried in the back of the Globe a couple
        of weeks ago:  A cable car in India snapped two of its three
        supporting cables while approaching a landing station halfway down
        devilishly high mountain.  The attendant immediately jumped out and
        fell to his death 70 feet below.  One of the passengers also
        escaped, but broke his back.  The car slid right past the landing
        station with several passengers still on board, including a mother
        with two small children.  The car continued to slide down its
        cable, accelerating to 270 miles per hour until it hit a snag in
        the cable and jerked violently to a halt.  The car dangled there,
        nearly a mile above the ground, for two days while various rescue
        attempts failed.  Finally, after they had been hanging by a thread
        for two days, an Indian army helicopter hovered above them and the
        passengers stepped out through the roof, which was on the side at
        that point, and clambered onto the rope ladder to be taken off, one
        or two at a time.

        "I believe that I have preserved the honor of the Presidency."

                                        -- George Bush concession speech

        Way back in the days of Desert Storm euphoria, enthusiastic Bush
        supporters were urging him to ride his popularity to achieve his
        goals.  As recently as Friday Bush supporters, their enthusiasm
        perhaps understandably waning, were urging the President to get
        out there with his story.  He never did.  He never showed any
        enthusiasm for his candidacy beyond what could be attributed to
        being in a good mood on a particular day.

        Try this out:  George Bush, millionaire patrician, eastern
        Republican, kind and gentle, patriotic American, deep down in his
        human heart and soul, just couldn't face another four years of
        being the whining bride of the Republican right wing, another four
        years of selling out George Bush to buy being President Bush so he
        cleverly sabotaged his own candidacy by diving deep into
        the gutter without coming up with a complementary treatment of his
        own plans.

        The President must have been wrenched beyond belief by having
        Clinton toss Prescott Bush back in his face after he tried to
        float the ridiculous KGB agent proposition.  How could the former
        director of the CIA have believed that for a minute?

        Or, maybe he's no more than the man he's always seemed to be.

Subj:   fish vs automobiles -- sometimes the difference is not obvious

Re Godzilla in Desperado #3069,

Godzilla is indeed GOJIRA in Japanese, but I don't think he's named after a
bad-tempered guy named Gojira. It's written in katakana, meaning it's a foreign
or coined word. It's a combination of the English (and Japanese) word
"gorilla", and the Japanese word "kujira", meaning whale. "Whale-sized Gorilla
of the Sea" sort of thing. Like "Chicken of the Sea". As we all know canned
tuna is known by the English phrase "sea-chicken" in Japanese, derived from
that particular brand name of canned tuna.

Similarwise with Three Diamonds brand tuna sold in the US. Three Diamonds is
"Mitsubishi" in Japanese, but they translated it into English because it was
put on the market back when "Made in Japan" was associated with cheap, tinny
products. To this day, the brand name "Three Diamonds" sounds tinny, not
because it is Japanese, but because it's the brand name of the ultimate cheap
tinny product, a can of fish.

By the time Mitsubishi got around to selling cars in the US, "Made in Japan"
had cachet, so they left the name in Japanese. Plus they figured Americans
wouldn't buy a car if they knew it was made by a canned tunafish company,
"tunafish can" being not much more glamorous than "sardine can" in the
desirable-automobile-image department. Americans are still not accustomed to
the idea of companies like Mitsubishi that make everything from ground-up
squid-lip-based cat food to nuclear reactors and jet engines.

Ten years ago you could buy whale in little cans at the Japanese grocery,
available in the canned sea creature aisle, between the sea chicken and
the sea gorilla. According to Japanese pro-whalers, loss of canned whale from
the grocer's shelf would cause "irreparable harm to Japan's culinary
tradition." Rather like the loss of Spam might be to America's culinary
tradition. Intolerable! So, I can see their point of view. On the other hand,
it all kind of tastes like sea-chicken.

The -RA suffix became a monster naming convention:

            GOJIRA       (GO-rilla + ku-JIRA)
            GAMERA       (Game/kame = turtle)
            GIDOURA      (Ghidra in English. Gidou = in orbit)
            KINGIDOURA   (Golden Ghidra)
            MINIRA       (Gojira's son)
            MOSURA       (Mothra in English. Moth + ra)

(The above list courtesy of the gang in the NIHONGO notes conference. The gang
in this case being me and one Japanese guy, who I'm sure would rather remain
nameless.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        But, he wondered, how did the people who were being menaced
        actually figure out that the giant pterodactyloid hoo-ha that was
        smashing through their power lines and eating their tanks was named
        "Rodan"?  The creature was inarticulate, capable of sound-effects
        only, and was an utterly new phenomenon that everyone was
        mystified by, and yet at no point in the movie did anyone ever say
        "Let's call it Rodan|Gojira|Godzilla|Mothra."  These are not
        common names.  There seems to have been some sort of universal
        mental transmission that suddenly caused people running screaming
        down the street to shout "Ghidra! Ghidra!" and headlines to sprout
        "Gamera Eats City!"

        Did you know, by the way, that Dr. West of Dr. West's Medicine Show
        &amp; Junk Band, auteur of "The Eggplant that Ate Chicago" was the
        immortal Norman Greenbaum, auteur of "Spirit in the Sky"?

                He came from outer space, lookin for somethin to eat,
                He landed in Chicago.  He thought Chicago was a treat.
                (It was sweet; it was just like sugar).

        Yet another hero tragically and unjustly excluded from the
        Rock&amp;Roll Hall of Fame.

Subj:   Sax story

From the CLINTON list:

"TWO SAX PLAYERS"  by Ted Casher

   It was a June night in 1979 in Boston,  I was standing in the
entrance to the Great Hall at Quincy Market, dressed in black tie, with
clarinet, alto sax, and tenor sax at the ready.  The night before, my
friend the bandleader Bo Winiker had called and told me to be there to
play an evening of swing music for alumnae of Wellesley College.
   The musical fare encompassed Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Jerome
Kern, and Irving Berlin, interspersed with hits of the big-band era.
Very little dancing was taking place, however, the reuning women, not
having seen one another for years, were busy catching up.  And Bo, a
wise bandleader, had mastered the art of musical *sotto voce*.  . . .
The Wellesley audience's response to such efforts was the occasional
"super music" murmured by someone passing the band on the way to the
bar.  . . .
   We had just finished Benny Goodman's "A Smooth One" when I noticed a
tall handsome young man standing near the band listening intently.
During the break, he walked up to me and said, "Is that the new Bobby
Dukoff mouthpiece you're using on tenor?  You sound good!"
   In the players' world, mouthpiece talk is the lingua franca that
instantly identifies musicians to one another.  I said, "Yeah, it's the
best tenor mouthpiece I ever had.  I was at Bobby Dukoff's factory in
Florida, and he let me go through the two trays of mouthpieces before I
picked this one.  I love it!" . . .
   "That's a help," the young man said.  "Back when I was playing
regularly, I had a mouthpiece that would only play pet reeds.  Too many
headaches!"
   I asked him if he still played, and he said, "Not as much as I'd like
to.  I've been away from it for a while."
   "What are you doing now?"  I said.
   The man grinned.  "Well, my name is Bill Clinton, and I'm the
governor of Arkansas.  Keeps me too busy to play much."
   I responded in my best musical-ambassador-of-Boston manner:
"Welcome to historic Faneuil Hall, Governor.  What brings you to our
fair city?"
   He said, "My wife went to Wellesley; this is her tenth reunion."
   Clinton pointed to a group of women talking excitedly.  . . . One of
them (I didn't know which) was attorney Hillary Rodman, caught up in the
"Remember when ...?" and leaving her spouse to his own devices.
   Clinton was eyeing my sax with the look of one who wanted to play.  I
said, "Want to sit in?  There's the tenor -- I've got an extra strap.
Gotta warn you:  it's a wide-open mouthpiece, and you've gotta put lots
of air through it."
  Clinton said, "Sure, I'd love it!"
   I found Bo and said, "Hey I've got a tenor player who wants to sit
in -- he's the governor of Arkansas and he seems to know what he's
doing."
   Bo was always receptive to a friendly encounter with a new musician,
and I made the introductions and let the two talk shop while I got my
spare strap out of my case.  Handing the strap and my tenor to Clinton,
I said, "Here -- enjoy!"
   The manner in which he handled himself revealed that, indeed, Clinton
knew what he was doing.  He blew a few experimental notes -- part of a
scale, a chord pattern, then a small melodic lick.  Bo said, "Get out
number 123, "Take the A Train".  We'll open it up for jazz at Letter C.
You've got the first chorus, Governor.  Long count: one, two,
one-two-three-four," and we were off and running.
   In this jazz standard, customarily the melody is stated first, and
then comes a two bar break for the first soloist.  Following jazz
musicians' etiquette, we gave our guest the solo break.  And he executed
it in perfect time, using all the right notes in a newly created
melody.
  Clinton's improvisation had us all listening closely.  He had a good
sound, played nice melodic ideas, and put them together in interesting
phrases.  His tenor playing was out of the Zoot Sims-Stan Getz school:
melodic, yet swinging.  He knew the standard backgrounds and played them
along with us, showing his conversance with jazz literature.  At the end
I told him to "read the outchorus; I'll fake another part."  Clinton
read music for the outchorus easily -- the governor had paid his
big-band dues, for sure.
   Next Bo called a blues tune; then we went into "Perdido,"  that Juan
Tizol-Duke Ellington standard.  The tune comes with a built-in
excitement level; it's almost impossible to play it softly.  By this
time, some of the audience had noticed their classmate's husband sitting
in with us, and a small crowd had gathered around the band.
  Again, Bill Clinton acquitted himself nobly.  He may have chosen to
follow a calling other than music, but you wouldn't be ashamed to take
him along on a gig -- the man could play.  (To those who recently heard
him play on television; please bear in mind that more than a decade of
rustiness has accrued since the Wellesley event.  After all, he hasn't
had much time to practice!)
   We finished "Perdido", the audience applauded, and a woman with big
glasses and long brown hair came out of the audience and proudly took
Clinton's arm.  He introduced his wife to us, and she told him, "You
sounded really good, dear."
   As Clinton handed me my tenor, I said, "If you ever meet up with some
electoral mishap and want to get back into music, call us up -- we'll
get you work!"  Smiling, he said, "I hope it doesn't happen, but just in
case, I'll remember!  Thanks for letting me use your horn -- this was
fun."
   At the time I didn't think anything extraordinary of that evening. I
did think the state of Arkansas was lucky to have a good tenor player in
the governor's office.
   Thirteen years have passed.  I have gone on to teach music and to
write, and that other sax player has gone on to run for president.
   Back in 1963, I was a young member of a band that played for JFK; I
was proud to make music for my president.  Now, as a fiftysomething
graybeard, I would be extremely proud to say that I made music *with* my
president!

(Ted Casher, a former music professor and Rhode Island State Council on
the Arts composer-in-residence, is the on-call saxophonist for the Rhode
Island Philharmonic Orchestra.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        This is clearly not just a kid who played sax in his high-school
        band. This is a musician.  So, in at least this area, Clinton
        actually claimed less for himself than he deserved.  I posted this
        in the Music notesfile where someone stated that Casher is
        considered a "musician's musician" and a leading figure in the New
        England jazz scene whose word is worth taking on these matters.

        In other words, if this is a hoax, it is a demonically clever one.

        I corrected spellings on Bo and Hilary's surnames.

&gt;       As for the "chain of two" theory, I had heard it as "chain of
&gt;       six" ...

The "chain" is a parlor game we used to play, that in my family was
traditionally called "getting a message to Eleanor Roosevelt".

But it's actually the "chain of five", and the guy who did the research (and
published an article about it in Scientific American years ago) is Stanley
Milgrom, the same psychologist who did the "obedience to authority" study.
(That study showed -- basically -- that most people would follow an order
to electrocute someone innocent person to death if an authority figure said
"I take full responsibility".)

Milgrom studied what he called, I believe, the "social distance" between
people.  That's your "chain".  He found that in the United States the mean
number of links in the chain between *any two* persons is five.  The parlor
game consists of constructing a plausible chain between yourself and some
other person chosen by another player.

   Is it too late to correct the spelling of err_net_indigestable_pna?

It's never to late to change anything.

A friend of mine comes from a large family whose children have always
been very close, united in large part by fear of their autocratic
father.

In her thirties, my friend married a person whose skin color was
different from hers.  Her father disowned her and refuse to
communicate with her.

This went on for several years.  Then, one Thanksgiving, my friend's
phone rang.  It was her father.  He had woken up that morning, this
spiteful, controlling, mean-spirited, hard-hearted man told her, and
realized he had been a complete asshole all his life.  He really did
love my friend, and wanted to reestablish contact with her and meet
her husband.  Would they visit the family home at Christmas?  In
tears, she accepted the invitation.

The visit went beautifully, and relations between my friend's father
and the rest of her family, including her husband, have been warm ever
since.  Her father has not reverted to his previous way of being.

Some people refuse to acknowledge the magic that fills the world, but
I see it every day, once in a great while in the story of someone who
finds it within himself to change the destructive behavior of a
lifetime in a single moment.

By contrast, your problem doesn't require you to change *your*
character, just one character in a file.  If you want to change it for
R2, just let me know, and I'll put a line in the release notes.

        Why does Spike Lee get so much credit for "ripping the veil off" or
        whatever he did vis-a-vis interracial romance and marriage in his
        movie "Jungle Fever"?  When I first hung out with beatniks in
        Chicago in 19-ought-and-fifty-nine there was a whole interracial
        couple scene going on there and to this day across the country
        there are millions of interracial romances and marriages.  In my
        own family there are two interracial couples and nobody made more
        than a little bit of fuss about one of them, and no fuss whatsoever
        about the other.

I've been told (by Jewish friends) that many everyday items must be
sanctified before use; for instance, a microwave oven can be rendered
kosher by boiling water in it for some period of time (again, according
to my friends).

Makes one wonder what they had to do to kosherize a laser.......

&gt;Subj: wiggling and cracking
&gt;
&gt;    My girlfriend can vibrate her eyeballs.  She opens them wide and shakes
&gt;    'em with the rest of her face sitting perfectly still.  It's eerie.  Her
&gt;    optometrist says it's a pretty unique ability.  She says it takes a
&gt;    fair amount of effort and she can only do it for a few seconds at a
&gt;    time.  I think it's neat.

I, too, can perform this particular parlor trick.  I'll often do it if
some nameless wageslave is trying to send me into the bureaucratic morass.
It usually takes them about 1-2 minutes to notice, but the double takes
are well worth the wait.

My wife, however, thinks it rather strange and uncomfortable.

&gt;        So what parts of your body can you crack, wiggle, maneuver, wield,
&gt;        or manipulate that most folks can't?

I can crack my rib cage (well, two ribs, anyway); it makes a noticeable
sound that tends to startle everyone in the room.

&gt;least eight joints at once.

                1 medium-size cork (trim to fit)
                  lead tape (found in bait/tackle shops)
                1 medium-size nail
                  cardboard and scissors

        Construct as illustrated:

                downward in descent, and the fins stabilize the whole thing.

                             PASTA THEORY OF SOFTWARE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Letter to the Editor
        CROSSTALK, Journal of Defense Software Engineering

  The mention of "a feast of spaghetti code" ("Computer Collectives", CrossTalk,
April/May 1992) prompted this response:

  Nearly every software professional has heard the term spaghetti code as a
pejorative description for complicated, difficult to understand, and impossible
to maintain, software.  However, many people may not know the other two
elements of the complete Pasta Theory of Software.

  Lasagna code is used to describe software that has a simple, understandable,
and layered structure.  Lasagna code, although structured, is unfortunately
monolithic and not easy to modify.  An attempt to change one layer conceptually
simple, is often very difficult in actual practice.

  The ideal software structure is one having components that are small and
loosely coupled; this ideal structure is called ravioli code.  In ravioli
code, each of the components, or objects, is a package containing some meat
or other nourishment for the system; any component can be modified or replaced
without significantly affecting other components.

  We need to go beyond the condemnation of spaghetti code to the active
encouragement of ravioli code.

        And then there's pizza code -- a solid substrate with complete
        customization at the user level.

        I've always thought that networking software was the epitome of
        lasagna code, but I never knew what to call it before.

        I love the name of the journal of defense software.

        I got lots of copies of this, but it was too apt not to run.

  On one side, the cellular telephone industry has argued vigorously that
cellular carriers should be allowed to vie for more spectrum to offer wireless
telephone services, and the commission should award many regional licenses
much the way it did for cellular phone service.

  On the other side, companies such as MCI and cable television operators that
have no cellular holdings want a better shot at entering the wireless phone
business, thueathed a strange legacy to this small city in Northern Italy.

  As the setting for Shakespeare's 16th-century tragedy "Romeo and Juliet,"
Verona inherited the curiosity of literary scholars, a celebrated theatrical
tradition and several hundred thousand tourists a year.

  In the bargain, the city also became the star-crossed lovers' capital of the
world.

Subj:   Oh tell me, Mr. Desperado, is poor penmanship a psychiatric problem?

As a more-or-less habitual slasher of zeros and Z's (though not of 7's), I
was concerned to read the following wire-service clip:

    DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) - A police corporal was suspended and ordered to
    undergo psychiatric evaluation because he writes the number seven with
    a line through the downstroke.

    Brian Yinger said he tried to break the habit when he was ordered to
    six months ago but was brought before a department disciplinary board
    when he forgot while writing some reports.

    "The way he was writing them was confusing for the typist," said Police
    Chief Robert Deziel. "He defied the order to stop. He was told he would
    face disciplinary action."

    The board suspended Yinger without pay for three days. He also was
    ordered by Deziel to undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine
    whether the old sevens are out of his system.

What I want to know is, should I seek counseling for my zero-slashing habit
before it spreads to my 7's?

Worriedly,

Subj:   computer burritos

From: cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com (Curtis Jackson)
Subject: Ordering burritos from my SPARC

There is a little Mexican grocery nearby that has an assembly-line
burrito operation in back. You walk down the line with the person
who is making your burrito, telling them exactly what you want on it.
The problem is that the place is so good and such a good value that
the lines get quite long at times. So La Costena (that's a tilde n)
put in a fax machine and allows you to fax in your orders. Well, we've
gone a quantum leap beyond that with the following.

This is NOT a joke. Ross has taken advantage of the fact that some
PostScript Level 2 printers now have fax capability. Read the whole
doc below when you get a chance -- it represents true burrito decadence!

Curtis
======================================================

Tired of standing in line at La Costena?  This file documents an
automatic facility for sending a fax to La Costena that orders 1 or
more burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and whatever.  The command will
compose the fax, and send it to your favorite PostScript fax printer,
for direct transmission to La Costena, and no paper at this end will
be generated.  Then, when you get there, your food will be waiting.
No worries.

To use this, you will want to add the following lines to your .cshrc
file:

setenv BURRITOPRINTER = &lt;printer&gt;
alias burrito /user/thompson/public/burrito&lt;mach&gt;

where &lt;mach&gt; is dec, sun, or sparc, as appropriate.  Requests to
support other machine types will be greeted with enthusiasm if the
following conditions are met:
 1) I can get the code to compile with a minimum of effort.
        (I expect no difficulties, but you never know).
 2) I am provided with the name of a machine on which to do the build.

&lt;printer&gt; should be the name of a PostScript level 2 printer that
supports fax and is connected to an external phone line. I use
griffin, which is located in building A upstairs.  However, griffin's
queue has been stuck for days, and so if you have an alternative
printer you can use, I recommend you use it.  (Also, please let me
know what it is.)  I have been trying to get Andy and Ron to unstuck
griffin, but they are very busy people and ordering burritos doesn't
seem to be a priority with them for some reason.

You will also probably want to create a .costenarc file, to define
your burrito macros in.  The one in /user/thompson/.costenarc is
designed to stand as an example that you can use.  Feel free to copy,
modify, whatever.  I think the syntax should be pretty
straightforward, if you understand how to describe a burrito.

In keeping with long standing Unix tradition, the syntax for
specifying burritos is somewhat obscure. Here is an attempt at
explanation, with some examples at the end.  For a better
understanding, the energetic reader will attempt to thoroughly
comprehend the contents of my .costenarc file.

burrito [-n "name"] [-t &lt;time&gt;] [-p phone#] [-d] [-x] [FoodSpec [...]]

    -n  specify the name at the top of the order blank.
           This should be the name of the person who will pick
           up the order.  Default is current user, as defined in
           /etc/passwd.
    -t  specify the time at which you will pick up the order.
           time may be absolute 24 hour time or +delta. Default is +1:00.
           Note that La Costena specifies a 20 minute on small orders
           and 60 minute on large orders minimum notification time.
    -p  specify callback number in case La Costena has questions.
           default is as found in /usr/local/adobe/phones/adobe.phones.
           If your phone number is not specified, and burrito can't
           figure it out by looking in adobe.phones, an error will result,
           and the order will not be transmitted.
           syntaxes for phone numbers:
                    entry               interpretation
                (408)123-4567           (408)123-4567
                123-4567                (415)123-4567
                x4567                   (415)962-4567
            If you are entering the phone number on the command line
            (instead of using a macro) please note that the ()'s need
            to be escaped: \(408\)....
  The following two options are installed primarily to help me debug
  the code.  There is probably no reason for general use of these options,
  unless you have some perverse desire to see the guts of this thing
  in operation.
    -d  debug: print the file locally rather than faxing it.
    -x  xmit off: don't run the shell script at all.  PostScript file
        will be left in ~/.faxorder.ps

Up to six FoodSpecs can be specified:

FoodSpec::=&lt;type&gt;[options*][/&lt;name&gt;]
&lt;type&gt; ::= [b|t|m|q|T]
    (burrito, taco, mexico city, quesadilla, Taqitaco)
options:
    +g  gucamole
    +c  cheddar
    +cc cotija
    +cl cilantro
    +cm monterey
    +i"note" special instructions (e.g. black beans, no rice, etc.)
        NOTE: the "s need to be escaped if the shell sees them:
           +i\"note\"
    +j  whole jalepenos
    +jf fresh jalapenos
    +js sliced jalapenos
    +n:&lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt; copies of this food item. (default = 1)
    +o  olives
    +s  medium salsa
    +sc sour cream
    +sf fire salsa
    +sh hot salsa
    +sm mild salsa
    +sv salsa verde
    +t  tomato
    +v:ca carne azada
    +v:cc chile colorado
    +v:cv chile verde
    +v:f  fiesta
    +v:l  lengua  (beef tongue)
    +v:m  mole    (chicken)
    +v:p  pastor
    +v:pb pollo borracho
    +v:rb rice and beans (default)
    +v:v  vegetarian
    +z:l  large
    +z:r  regular (default)
    +z:c  chico (small)

    -[option] cancels option.  Not valid for ":" options or +i.
       This is useful for modifying burrito macros specified in
        .costenarc file.

example:

burrito -time +:30 b+g+cc+jf+jf+sf+sc-sc+i"Black Beans"+n:2/Ross \
   b+v:cc+g+cm+sc+i"no rice"/Kathie

interpretation:
logged in user will pick up an order in 30 minutes.
  Ross wants two rice and bean (default) burritos with
    guacamole
    cotija
    fresh jalepenos (double)
    fire salsa
    no sour cream (cancelled)
    Black beans (comment)
  Kathie wants a Chile Colorado burrito with
    guacamole
    montery cheese
    sour cream
    no rice (comment)

You should keep your +i comments short, because there isn't much space on
the form for them, and the space is not used particularly well by my
PostScript program.  "Black beans, no rice" is about as long a
message as it can handle.

FILES:
        /etc/passwd
        /usr/local/adobe/phones/adobe.phones
        $HOME/.costenarc
        $HOME/.faxorder.ps

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
        BURRITOPRINTER

BUGS:
   There's all kinds of ways to break this thing.  The lines in your
.costenarc file should be less than 1000 characters, or the stack will
get trashed.  The PostScript program does not make particularly good
use of the "Comments" section of the form (controlled by the "+i"
switch), and doesn't detect when it is writing things off the side of
the page.  I have no idea what will happen if the disk is full when
burrito tries to write the .faxorder.ps file, or if it can't open it
because the directory is protected, or whatever.  But if you are
reasonable in your expectations of the program, and don't try to break
it, I think you'll find that it's adequate.  For bug reports, see my
comments below about future enhancements.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
   This is the kind of thing that everybody will have suggestions on
how to improve.  I will duly record every feature enhancement request,
but I can't promise that I'll do any more than that.  I have no
intention whatsoever, for example, of writing a Graphical User
Interface for this thing, even though so many people think that it's a
natural.  As I have said (many times) before about this: "When I'm
done with the program, you are more than welcome to add any features
that you wish."  Well, I'm (essentially) done.  Anyone who wants the
source, it's in /user/thompson/public/burrito.c.  Go for it.

        Nice to have a major hack.  Can that thing work outside the Costeña
        context?

        Another one butts the dice.

        Have a nice dream,
        Yr bdy,
        Tom Parmenter
