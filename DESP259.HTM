 The Smithsonian isn't saying anything about bombing Japan that the
 Strategic Bombing Survey didn't say in 1946.  No doubt there's some
 PC weaseling in the exhibit, but the conclusion of the survey was
 that smashing Dresden and Hiroshima had little strategic effect and
 in fact made our enemies determined to fight harder.  I guess the
 Smithsonian exhibit was hostage to the cancellation of that A-bomb stamp
 with the "Linchpin of Victory" slogan last month.

 And Jocelyn Elders?  Anent self-pollution, schools used to teach not
 to do it and now they teach that it's something that happens.  In
 other words, they already do what Elders had the good sense to agree
 with in responding to a casual question.

 You may not have read that Jocelyn Elders' medical practice in
 Arkansas included consulting on almost all births where physical
 deformities resulted in uncertainty as to whether the child was male
 or female.  This kind of consultation typically is not completed
 until the child reaches puberty.  In other words, she knows a lot
 about the development of sexuality and sexual feelings.

(true story! overheard: "...she's known the guy for like two weeks
on the computer, and...").

One example of computer communications shorthand has me very confused
in a certain grammatical situation, and I'm wondering how others deal
with it.  I'm positive this isn't nitpicking, because soon enough
email will be as pervasive as the telephone, and we've certainly
strictly codified how to communicate over *that*.  We'll need to do
the same for when email is as common as the telephone.  (OK OK, so
maybe it IS nitpicking.  Either way, it's still damned annoying!!)

The situation is this:

When you are using a smiley-face to end a parenthetical comment, how do
you end the comment, paren-wise?  Do you say:

1.)     rocks (but that's just my opinion :-).  So, anyway,
2.)     rocks (but that's just my opinion :-)).  So, anyway,
3.)     rocks (but that's just my opinion :-) ).  So, anyway,
4.)     rocks (but that's just my opinion (-: ).  So, anyway,
5.)     rocks (but that's just my opinion (-:).  So, anyway,

I personally choose #3 from above.  Giving the smiley a whitespace on
either side seems to set it off without ruining the readability of the
parenthetical comment like #2 does, or without the amibiguity of #1.

#4 and #5 are also more pleasant alternatives, if you're from the camp
that doesn't believe that there is a true polarity for the smiley,
namely  ":-)".  I am not one of those heathens, myself.

 See figure 1.  Data compression is the only way to go.  You can stack
 parentheses if you have stacked parenthetical expresssions (happens
 to us all), but in this situation the little guy can do double
 doorman duty, both smiling and ushering you out.

&gt;  "The Madness of King George" ....  Opened-up play it may be, but it's
&gt;  hard to imagine how closed the play must have been.

You forgot to mention that the play's title was "The Madness of King
George III."  I have it on good authority that the movie moguls had to
drop the numeral for fear that potential audiences would think they
had missed parts I and II.

 That's as may be, but George III is the only King George who means
 anything to Americans.  George I and II were a pair of Germans.  II
 gave his name to my home state and was the last British monarch to
 fight for his country on the battlefield.  George IV is in the movie
 and lives on in history as the worst British monarch of modern times.
 George V and George VI visited the troops in WW1 and WW2
 respectively.  But George III is ours and we ran him out fair and
 square.  To us, King George *is* King George III, so I don't know that
 the marketers were all wrong.  Now they can do a movie called "The
 Madness of King George II" about George IV and his wives.

RE: man pages

The man pages for UNIX V6 (ca 1978) had the following definitions for two
shell commands:

        true            Does nothing, successfully
        false           Does nothing, unsuccessfully

&gt;
&gt;I recall that Ken Olsen remarked about the VAX 8600 that this was the first
&gt;computer that was more complex than a single human could understand
&gt;completely. (The memory, cpu, and bus structure was such that no one person
&gt;could master all of the workings.)

I do remember Ken saying something like that, but nothing referencable.
I also remember the claim that the great thing about the VAX 8600 was that
now you could have a 2-user ALL-IN-1 system.

There are at least two weekly digests of strange news items which are both
syndicated, and distributed by their authors via EMail.

1.  Chuck Shepherd's "News of the Weird" can be subscribed to by sending your
Internet address to NotW-Request@NINE.Org .

2.  Randy Cassingham's "This Just In" can be subscribed to by sending a
message with the body:

subscribe this-just-in

(that's the message body, not the subject line) to the address
ListServ@NetCom.Com .

There doesn't seems to be much overlap between the two lists, which would not
have surprised Robert L. Ripley.

From: wblair@ftp.com  (Wayne A.Blair)

Hi Tom,

Early to mid 1980's VMS/RTL got one of those "we got you now" SPR's
regarding VMS' caculations of leap year 2000 (or was it 2100?).

Stan Rabinowitz answered the SPR with a grace, dignity, flare, and fodder
that should be posted throughout eternity (minus appropriate leap-entities).

Does a desperadi have this answer who could/would/should post it for
all to read?

Thanks!
