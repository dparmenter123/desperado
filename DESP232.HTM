Tom,

This is my first contribution to DESPARADO, but the bog roll controversy
is just  too good to pass up.  It'll be interesting to see if this
actually gets into the  next go-around.

My own strategy regarding the correct orientation of toilet paper
vacillates  between mindless conformity and covert sabotage.  My personal
preference is  over-the-top, but half the time, (well, more than half now
that I'm married) I  just shrug and use it whatever way I get it. For some
reason, the rest of the  time, if possible, I quietly switch the
orientation to my prefered over-the-top  mode.  No hoopla, no scene, no
fanfare.  I just switch it.  I've even done it in  a public restroom.
Shocked?  I thought so. Sociopathological? Perhaps, but  sometimes, a
man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.  What else can I say?

I guess I could say that I don't like the loose end touching the grungy
wall,  but that's not the point.

Have an good one.

Wook

P.S. As a Korean-American, I may have a clue as to what a salted
uneviscerated  yellow croaker might be (namely a kind of fish), but if you
could find the name  of it transliterated from Korean, I could probably
find out whether or not it  does in fact fly off the shelf.

Subject: Holiday dining

A friend at Rational sent over the following tidbit:

A coworker at a friend's company has a shelf where she keeps mementos of
her trips from all over the world.  Recently she discovered something
that hadn't been there before -- a little can of Kelly's Pork Brains in
Gravy, featuring a little leprechaun on the label, and a pop-top for
easy opening (obviously a snack can for a box lunch or casual noshing at
the 7-11, say).

She immediately questioned all who might be responsible.  One other
co-worker failed to respond immediately, then suddenly sent her this
enchanting message (I wonder if we could send a can of the stuff to Dave
Barry):

If you want your guests to take a hike,
But don't know how to tell 'em,
Just mention you'll be serving up
A porcine cerebellum.

(Not chop or loin, or curly tail,
Not ribs or butt or trottah,
You mean the part right next to the
Medulla oblongata.)

You'll find that in America
Only the bravest forkers
Will munch on stuff extracted from
The skulls of mindless porkers.

They'll starve and moan and pinch their belts
Until they look like Twiggy
Before they'll touch a dish made from
Cerebrum de la piggy.

And when at last the guests are gone
With farewells kissy, wavy,
Have some chips and throw away
Those gross pork brains with gravy.

&gt;My friend added the following tag:

But would you eat them in a cube?
Would you eat them near a tube?
I will not eat those Brains O' Ham!
I do not like them, Sam I Am!

        I once hopped off a train along with 1600 other Boy Scouts to go
        to a catered breakfast in Wyoming.  What it was was cow brains in
        scrambled eggs, bushels and bushels and bushels of cow brains in
        scrambled eggs.  Lots of bushels.  And then 1601 Boy Scouts hopped
        back on the train, hungry, but uncowed.

        Interestingly, cow brains look a lot like scrambled eggs, but
        pinkish.

Desperado:

Indeed, what is in a name? Contrary to the subject line for #3060, the
Dong-A-Food recall was for *un*eviscerated yellow croaker. As in "not gutted,"
or whole. Makes them even more appetizing, I guess.

Also concerning names, I was reading the afterword to a book by Phillip K.
Dick  just before I got the latest Desperado. Dick was a gifted, if
somewhat twisted  (science) fiction writer; he was the definition of
willfully offbeat. From early  in his career, he struggled to transcend
the common  shoot-the-alien-with-a-laser-and-get-the-girl pulp that his
publisher, Ace  books, churned out. To fit his books into the formula, Ace
often eviscerated  them. Dick didn't find out about most of the changes
until the books were  published. Ace also changed the titles of his books.
World of Chance became  Solar Lottery, With Open Mind became Eye in the
Sky, and A Glass of Darkness  became The Cosmic Puppets. Oh, and you may
know his most famous book, Do  Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, as Blade
Runner, which was the title of the  movie based on his book.

Subj:   Mounting the toilet paper

Okay, so I'm never one to resist throwing a monkey wrench into a lively
debate.

Once upon a time, when, at a social event, we were asked to sort ourselves
by whether we mounted the toilet paper rolling from the front or back,
I founded one group which proclaimed that the old Sears, Roebuck catalog
was the only appropriate way to finish.  (The fourth group claimed they
used corncobs, and the fifth said they used nothing.)

Personally, since I can no longer find those comfortable old pages (they
now print the catalog on glossy coated stock), I follow the simple
algorithm of noting which way the old roll currently unwound, and
mountin the new roll in the OPPOSITE way.

I must ask you, Tom, do you plant these egregious instances of mal de

or are they honest oopsies?  (Actually, given your use of "nomen est
omen," I suppose I ought to phrase this query in Latin.)

IN QVOD SEQVITVR ERGO ATTENTIONEM TVAM DIRIGO:

&gt;       2 - The characters in the Chas. Addams cartoons mostly didn't
&gt;       have names, so when the TV show came along, they had to make them
&gt;       up.  They did pretty well:  Morticia, Gomez, Lurch, Tuesday,
&gt;       Puggsley, but it's something of a tragic loss that they didn't use
&gt;       Chas. Addams's name for Puggsley, the teenage boy, which was Pubert.

Tuesday is the praenomen of the actress who played Thalia Menninger in
"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," Weld then being her nomen unless it
appeared in Mad Magazine, in which case it was Wednesday, which latter,
by an entirely serendipitous but nonetheless diverting coincidence, was
the praenomen of Addams' charming little girl.

Subj:   Addams Family names

Regarding the bit on the Addams Family names in the latest Desperado:

The little girl was named Wednesday, not Tuesday.

I agree about the superiority of Pubert to Puggsley.  Pubert precisely
captures the streak of adolescent, rebellious nastiness of the original
cartoon character.  However, since the TV Addams boy was merely a fat,
ugly slob, rather than downright nasty, perhaps the name choice by the TV
folks is correct. As played, the TV character is more of a Puggsley than a
Pubert.

I do hate(1) to bring this up, but the charming jeune
fille(2) in the Addam's(3) Family is named Wednesday, not
Tuesday.  Perhaps you are thinking of Tuesday Weld? (No

Re: Solaris, finally an appropriate name.

Not being a reader of arcane science fiction, I wasn't able to find a
copy of Lem's novel.  But as an occasional student of literary
criticism, I did have a access to a copy of "Alien Encounters: anatomy
of Science Fiction" by Mark Rose (Cambridge MA: Harvard University
Press, 1981), which includes a reasonably extensive discussion of
Stanislaw Lem's novel "Solaris" in ch.3, pp. 82-95.

I quote from Rose's comments, which you might also find enlightening:

"Lem's initial move in Solaris is to choose as problematic a sign of
the nonhuman as possible. ...

"By making Solaris itself as unyieldingly problematic as possible, Lem
shifts the narrative emphasis ...

"Has the ocean [of Solaris] failed to respond to human overtures
because it is serenely contemptuous of mankind? ...

"as the novel proceeds, the inquiry turns more and more emphatically
into an analysis of the human motives behind the whole Solarist
enterprise ...

"And late in the novel we hear about the scholar Muntius, who regards
the Solarist enterprise as 'the space era's equivalent of religion:
faith disguised as science.' ...

"According to Muntius, 'Solaristics is a revival of long-vanished
myths, the expression of mystical nostalgias which men are unwilling
to confess openly.' ...

"Lem attempts to keep [Solaris] his sign of the nonhuman as empty, as
nonreferential as possible ...

"In Solaris, however, where there is little sense of joy, the complex
of protective barriers and enclosures seem rather to be an expression
of agoraphobia, the fear of open places ..."

Of course these comments refer solely to Lem's work of fiction, not,
it must be understood, to anything else that might by pure coincidence
have the same name.

      A suggestion for a DESPERADO topic perhaps stimulated by the
      continual downsizing rumours, shift of office location and 'new
      working practices' which means desk sharing and less storage space
      irrespective of your actual job needs. What could you possibly want
      to do outside of Digital? (Quelle idee!). I think this could
      stimulate some good replies from your regular contributors.

      SECRET AMBITION:

      I have always been fond of Freesias, one of the best scented
      flowers I know and they look good as well. Deep down inside I would
      like to breed new varieties of Freesia. The summit of my efforts
      will be a variety I will name 'Jolly Good Fellow' and this will
      become the most popular form. The result of this will be that all
      over the world people will walk into florists and say "Freesia
      Jolly Good Fellow" and I will have been responsible for making it
      all happen.

        Amherst police brought two complaints agains Croteau. One was
displaying a suspended license, to which he pleaded guilty andwas fined
$150, and the second was driving after suspension.  To this latter, he
pleaded innocent and the complaint was placed on file without a finding.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Here we see the cunning of the career criminal, confusing the cops
        with the names of his dogs (which will probably help immensely with
        his appeal), showing not only a suspended drivers license but an
        out and out fake dog registration.  And then, at the end of this
        riot of miscreancy, he successfully brazens it out on the charge of
        driving after suspension.

        "On the condition he commit no offense, including those related to
        dogs"?

        And, what were the names of Earl Witty's poultry?  And, where do
        you get a fake dog registration.  And, how old were Croteau's dogs?
        Is that in dog years?  Are Harry and Harold the same dog, or is it
        like Edmund and Edgar in King Lear?  Did Victoria do anything?
        What was her secret?  What really happened that night?  Will we
        ever know?

Subj:   Contribution to Desperado

Hi Tom,

After reading Desperado for many years, here is my humble contribution.

Lobsang Gyalpo

-------

An extract from an article in TIME Magazine Jan 20,1992 regarding
George Bush's recent visit to Japan, that highlights the differences
between Japan and the USA.

                ***************************

Even good old-fashioned American competitiveness may not be enough to
crack the market in a society where stylized rituals still predominate in
business as well as pleasure. Last week in Kyoto, Bush watched eight men
in brightly colored robes demonstrate an ancient Japanese game called
'kemari', in which players use their feet to keep a large deerskin ball
inside their small circle without ever letting it touch the ground. The
object of the 1,300-year-old game is not so much to win as to display
proper form and correct etiquette. The President watched the
less-than-riveting spectacle for a while, then impulsively threw
himself into the contest. Without regard for the players' harmony, or 'wa',
Bush entered the circle (strike 1), hit the ball with his head, soccer-style
(strike 2), and kicked it out of the circle completely (strike 3). At
game's end, while the Japanese players politely tried to mask their dismay,
he shouted, "We won! We won!".

Anyone in the Palo Alto area should rush at once to Molly Stone's
grocery on California Avenue, where you can experience first hand the
cultural dislocation that comes with being an anthropologist among,
say, head-hunters.  The produce section now has a stage whereupon
several dozen fabulously articulated dancing robot vegetables, singing
bagels, life-sized cows, and the like will deliver a three-minute
cultural performance aimed at discouraging the ingestion of various
socially disapproved plant-derived products, some but not all of which
are for sale in the store.  It's the damnedest thing, especially for
one educated both as a roboticist and an anthropologist; it's hard to
know whether to be more astonished at the micro-operation of
Foucault's "meticulous rituals of power" flying in the face of all
logic or at the sheer numbers of optical encoders, PID controllers,
and four-bar linkages that are going into backing them up.

        A classic spoonerism, and the only one I've actually heard
        uttered.  Our preacher let fly with it one Sunday morning.  I
        suppose he was worried about saying it.  The phrase itself is so
        arty, "one fell swoop".  Except for sword&amp;sorcery novels, I doubt
        if anyone's used the word "fell" in any other way for a century.

A writer looks at the world.
&gt;From Smiling Jack Sopka, nearly two years ago:

THE TEMPTATION TO EXIST, by E. M. Cioran; translated by Richard Howard.
Seaver Books. 222 pp $17.95.

THE TROUBLE WITH BEING BORN, by E. M. Cioran; translated by Richard Howard.
Seaver Books. 212 pp. $8.95 (paperback).

By Fanny Howe
Special to the Boston Globe

"All my books are more or less autobiographical - a rather abstract form of
autobiography, I admit," writes E. M. Cioran, a Rumanian philosopher who has
lived in Paris since 1937.  The philosophic essay, as a form of confession
certainly has its precedents, but it nonetheless remains an original way of
positioning oneself.  The writer's response to the world is what you get; and
no world.

Cioran is a committed pessimist.  The titles of some of his books include "A
Short History of Decay" and "Drawn and Quartered."  "The Temptation to Exist"
includes an introductory essay by Susan Sontag, and it gives her response to
his response in terms which often mirror his.

Cioran is Gnostic.  The Gnostic view, like his, sees birth as a calamity.
Captive in matter and in time, under the domination of a deceiving "father",
mankind reproduces its misery from one generation to the next.  Cioran starts
from this point: Humanity, fallen into time, invents reasons to exist.
Civilization is at its best for him when it is, in contemporary terms, at its
worst - that is, when it is elitist, intolerant and self_referential.  This
goes for the church too.

In "The Temptation to Exist" there are vituperative essays about Europe,
literature, saints, Jews, philosophers and an open letter to a writer that
assaults the act of writing.  Fiction is especially revolting to Cioran, who,
for all his spleen, has humor.  Given that his attack on writing comes from
the pen of a writer himself, this letter is about as self-critical as you can
get.  "Poem, novel, essay, play," he writes, "everything seems too long.  The
writer - it is his function - always says more than he has to say: he swells
his thought and swathes it with words. . . .Every word is a word de trop.  Yet
the question is: to write.  Let us write. . . . Let us dupe each other."

The word "dupe" is significant because it is possible to imagine him, under
other circumstances, as a comedian, given the way his language trembles at the
edge of caricature.  Even at his most poisonous and passionate, there is a
touch of the poseur.  This touch is in a sense the confirmation of his theory.
The world is artificial.  So if Cioran is serious, he has to be joking.

In the collection of aphorisms, published simultaneously by the same press and
translated as well by the poet Richard Howard, Cioran's thoughts are reduced
to their essence.  In terms of wit, wickedness and insight, you couldn't get a
more potent dose than this.

Some examples:

        "Having always lived in fear of being surprised by the worst, I
        have tried in every circumstance to get a head start, flinging
        myself into misfortune long before it occurred."

        "This is how we recognize the man who has tendencies toward an
        inner quest: he will set failure above any success, he will even
        seek it out, unconsciously, of course.  This is because failure,
        always essential, reveals us to ourselves, permits us to see
        ourselves as God sees us, whereas success distances us from what
        is most inward in ourselves and indeed in everything."

        "The certainty of being only an accident has accompanied me on all
        occasions, propitious or injurious, and if it has saved me from
        the temptation to believe myself necessary, it has not on the
        other hand entirely cured me of a certain vainglory inherent in
        the loss of illusions."

Statements like these, based in the vocabulary of those thinkers who prededed
phenomenology, are accessible to any reader.  Yet there is a quality to his
thought which is distinctly European and a little chilling in the eyes of an
American reader, especially in those essays regarding nations and Jews.  While
his comments on literature and art, on human behavior and our quest for
meaning in a time of fundamental despair are important, his pessimism gets too
close to the nihilism of our century.  He sometimes seems less a critic than a
spokesperson for that nihilism.  When his thought is that of the negative
mystic and he is tempted to construct a new form of salvation - or liberation
- for the person, you wish he wouldn't stop at temptation.

        I don't know much about rot, but I know what I like:  wine and
        cheese.  I also like it that dead stuff soesn't stay around
        forever.  Oh, yes, and compost.

        On the other hand, as the little woman (Mrs. Desperado) says, "A
        pessimist is never disappointed."

        For that matter, anyone who moved to Paris from Rumania in 1937
        and then stayed there knows a lot about flinging himself into
        misfortune.

Recently my wife bought a cape from Lillian Vernon for our son.  It
was made in Taiwan, and had the following care instructions
(verbatim):

Care Instructions: (Specify method to wash and dry item; give
temperatures when applicable.)

Seems no one who could read english bothered to check the tag before

Subj:   Quote of the day revisited

        Only two significant things came out of Berkeley: LSD and
        UNIX.  We don't believe this to be a coincidence.

Since it has already been pointed out that Unix did not come out of Berkeley, I
should complete the equation by pointing out that LSD did not come from
Berkeley either.

In this era of sound bites, I suppose two factual errors per sentence is not
too bad. At least they did not misspell Berkeley.

LSD was first synthesised by Dr. Albert Hofmann as part of an investigation of
ergot derived compounds for Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland) in the 1930s. The first
human ingestion of LSD was April 19, 1943 by the good Doctor.

I wonder if the Post Office will issue commemorative stamps for next year's
50th anniversary of this event?

Subject: cheese, life, and death

The life of some cheeses is brief but sunny: che`vres, farmer cheeses,
they taste of nothing but freshness and youth.  Other cheeses, like
Parmesan, start life young and simple but grow old and wise; some very
few, like Stilton, are to be eaten only after death.  The majority of
good cheese offer a choice: between those that live defyng death and
those that wait only to embrace it.  This latter is what imbues a
French Camembert with its special character -- that buttery perfume of
anticipated corruption.  We Americans could not love a God whose feet
smelled like ripe Camembert.  But we know they do not.  They smell, if
anything, like Cabot Vermont cheddar, aged fourteen months, cut straight
from the wheel.

&gt;Subject: Re: A new way to hose the students

&gt;No one is sure that this ever happened, but you do still see the occasional
&gt;exam prep sheet from a professor that says, "You may use anything that you
&gt;can carry in except another person."

Better yet, since Caltech has an honor system most exams tend to be take
home and open book.  The instructor for the class will write any special
directions at the top of the exam.  For a freshman physics exam one year
the instructions read:

                            You have 3 hours.
                You may use your class notes and Feynman.

"Feynman" of course referred the Feynman physics lecture notes which are
published in three volumes.

On reading these instructions one particularly alert student grabbed his
exam and raced across campus to Richard Feynman's office.  He handed the
exam to Feynman explaining that the directions clearly indicated he was
a valid resource.  Feynman glanced over the instructions and agreed.  He
wrote out the exam in less than half an hour, and got a perfect score!

        I bought a hell of a neat thing last weekend at Rat Shack . . . a
        $10 microscope.  It's about the size of a remote TV zapper and
        magnifies 30 times.  It has a light, so all you do is place it on
        top of what you want to look at, fiddle the focus a little, and
        then look.  Paper is neat, and table salt is still in little cubes,
        but freshly ground black pepper looks like heaps of multicolored
        velvet.  If you have children or ever were one, this is a neat,
        cheap toy to have around the house.  Product of the decade.
