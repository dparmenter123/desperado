Subj:   SRL in Barcelona

        This is a mostly incoherent laundry list of SRL's stay in
Barcelona.  It makes no claims to completeness or correctness.
Summary: show was only OK, if that, mostly because of local support
problems; Barcelona itself is well worth a visit.

        Barcelona is a heavily industrial place, and the collecting was
pretty good.  On the other hand, trying to get reasonable electrical
hookups, tools, and industrial gases was almost impossible.  Here's
how Barcelona works:
        9:00-2:00       everything is open
        2:00-5:00       lunch, siesta; can't disturb the neighbors
        5:00-8:00       some things open again; some don't
        8:00-11:00      streets empty; people go home
        11:00-4:00      Barcelona drinks, drugs, and dances
I commented on this to one of our hosts, and she said "Oh, but this is
the hard-working part of Spain -- in Madrid they get much less done."
The place most of us were sleeping was a prime hangout for
transvestites and hash dealers.  It was (perhaps not by mere
coincidence) across the street from the headquarters of the Spanish
navy.
        (Barcelona is a great place to wander around.  Interesting from
the historical point of view (good historical, archaeological, and art
museums); interesting from a Modern (1880's - 1930's) point of view;
interesting from a contemporary point of view.  Catalonian separatists,
lunatic artists, local culture with something of an attitude problem --
all readily available.)

        The shop was in a large barn-like thing at the Mercat de les
Flors, a 1929 Exhibition building that had been recently renovated as a
theater.  The original site was a large courtyard across the street,
bordered by two apartment buildings and anothe 1929 building.  All of
the buildings, new and old, were unreinforced masonry.  (The
archaeologist in me decided that some of the bricks weren't even
completely fired.)
        The local sponsors warned us that the neighbors had
misunderstood what SRL was about, and were starting a protest movement.
This was not necessarily bad, since local activism is a rare phenomenon
in Barcelona, and it felt kind of OK to have provoked some.
They hung out banners saying
                Arte y Cultura -- SI
                Peril -- NO
        When the container arrived, driven by a local trucker, it
was backed into a brick wall, which collapsed on one of the
neighbors, killing him.  Everybody felt awful about this, but
it's not clear what anyone could or should have done before or after
the incident.  Star-crossed we arrived, and so everything continued.

        The main Art Futura show was OK.  There was some pretty good
video work (details in a separate note), and some overly cute but
technically good stereo graphics stuff.  The lecture series was also
OK, although I'm getting awfully tired of random visionaries talking
about Virtual Reality, Telepresence, and such.  The most interesting
guests were Laurie Anderson, William Gibson, and the members of Buzz.
Anyway, the neighbors hadn't objected to last year's Art Futura, which
involved wooden crates filled with dynamite and salted mackerel.
        We did a couple of tests for the benefit of the Art Futura patrons;
the video show started at 10:00 each evening, and we demonstrated the rail
gun for them, which brought the police, and the Big Blower, which brought the
police, and the Big Arm, which brought the police.  We didn't have
a fire permit.  We didn't have a noise permit.  We didn't have a permit
to operate a motor after 10:00 PM.  I kept running the Arm while the
police were there the second time, and, as they were explaining to the
neighbors how utterly safe it all was, the Arm picked up a large steel
traffic barrier and started waving it in the air.  Some things were just
meant to happen.

        After a great deal of arguing, pouting, and dallying, we got a
new site, which NATO promptly took away from us.  We then got a third
site, in front of the National Palace, a huge neo-baroque wedding-cake
of a building, with fountains and spotlights and terraces and Monumental
Vistas.  Very grand indeed.  (And we had the Barcelona Pavilion as a
neighbor down the steps.)
        It was something of a pain having the shop so far from the site;
we did do some creative disruption of traffic, though, which helped
lighten the mood a little.  My favorite was wheeling a 30' tall spindly
steel tower (with someone on top holding together a broken weld) through
pre-lunch traffic from the Leather and Fur Show.  Setting up for an SRL
show while surrounded by professional fashion victims is more than a
little amusing.  (We were sandwiched between the Leather and Fur Show
and the EuroPak consumer product packaging show.)
        The tesla coil fried its spark-gap motor, causing a great deal
of worry; getting a motor re-wound in Spain on short notice is something
of a challenge.  The Big Flame Blower died completely.  It only rains
3 days in Barcelona in January.  While we were there it rained 10 of
those 3 days.  Everything was very soggy.  Next time, we soak stuff in
gasoline if it's been raining.

        The set had a 3.5 story palace in the middle, done in glass and
faux marble, a warped reflection of the National Palace behind it.  This
palace is sitting in the lowest of the three fountains.  To the
right was a three-bayed arcade, also of faux marble, with decorative
spires and finials.  To the left was a rotating 60' tower; Barcelona
is a very architecturally conscious city, and has lots of spires and
domes.  There was a giant teeter-totter with a steel stick-figure on
one end and a cow on the other.  The stick figure was wearing a bunch
of goat heads, and the cow was poised above a vat of oil.  There were
gargoyls and pinatas sprinkled about the set.

        The tower of power, dressed on black and gold robes and carrying
a reeking pot of anti-incense, wanders back and forth in front of the
arcade.  It backs off a ways, and...
        The Arm bursts out of the central door of the arcade, almost
tipping the whole arcade over.  It trudges over the splinters of the
wall and heads towards a large covered dish near the audience.  Lovely
Rita (a modified meter-maid cart with a 10' spine robot (called The
Finger) and a life-sized golden cow mounted on it) bursts from behind the
glass-fronted slot in the arcade, and zips towards the audience, making
menacing gestures with the finger.  A loud whoosh, and the V1 knocks over its
screen, and heads towards the Arm and Rita.  On the opposite side, the Walking
Machine, using its explosively powered kicker, knocks over its wall and
stomps out.  (The kicker is capable of booting a 55 gallon drum up a
flight of stairs.)
        The Arm lifts the lid, revealing a large gargoyle underneath.
Rita decides it looks like fun, but the V1 burns gargoyle and lid before
anyone can get too much pleasure out of them.  The Arm goes to play
ith some hanging pinatas, and stalls.
        [From here on, I'm a little hazy in exact details; lots of
things started going wrong.]
        The 6- and sngle-barrel shockwave cannons start to fire.  The
audience is introduced to the horror of carnage in a shower of goat
blood.  (The blood is mixed with wallpaper paste to make it stick
together better as it flies through the air, and to stick better when it
hits someone.)  The fountain inside the mock palace starts to run red,
too.  Rita find some small grotesques lying around to play with.
        A 16' diameter reproduction of a bunch of happy but
demented-looking singers from a Goya painting slides down a cable
strung above the audience; the effect is quite startling.  The V1
applies its flame to this new threat, with minimal success.
(Damn the rain.)
        At this point, the spire is supposed to turn, and the
teeter-totter is supposed to rock, but the motor on the hydraulic
pump dies.  Indeed, our whole electrical system gets toasted.
Fortunately, the tesla coil is on its own generator and is able to
function admirably.  The spark shooter and several interesting noise
makers cease working.  After the show, all of the generators seemed
pretty unhappy -- electrical smoke is SO depressing.
        In the confusion, the shaker has come out of the arcade, and is
fnding things to grab and shake; the teeter-totter sways, but
doesn't fall.
        Rita and the V1 argue over the cow, which catches fire as
a result.  The V1 trains its wrath on the spire, which fails to ignite.
The Arm starts up again, and wanders over to the cow, having a slight
altercation with Rita on the way.  Rita has by this time lost some
control of the finger.  The V1, wanting to be alone, goes and tries to
torch the arcade.
        The walking machine, slow and cumbersome as always (and further
suffering from a bad case of electrical system blues) has been kicking
away at things, with only partial success.  The Shaker comes up behind it,
grabs it by a leg, and starts to shake.  The walking machine looks horribly
unstable at the best of times; when something like a 2-ton off-balance
centrifuge is clinging to it, it looks positively ludicrous.  A chain or
two snaps, effectvely halting the walking machine.
        At this point, the Tower of Power receives a full does of the
healing Tesla energies.  Blue sparks dance around its head; its motor
goes to a higher plane of existence; its operator is fortunately at the
end of a very long cable.  The Tower of Power falls silent.
        Rita has been abusing the stick figure, and now abuses the Arm
as the Arm bats the burning cow back and forth for a few minutes.  The
V1 rams the Tower of Power, and then burns it and heads back to the
spire.  The V1's flame has been getting smokier and smokier, and now
casts a thck, oily pall over the whole area.
        The Arm stalls again.  The Shaker tries to sneak up on Rita, but
doesn't quite.
        The Arm lifts itself up, and knocks on the spire, which wobbles a
little.  This is interesting.  The Arm grabs the spire, and pulls, then
pushes, then twists.  Metal shrieks.  Things start to move.  60 feet
of metal tower, carefuly situated 50' from the audience, starts to
fall.  It takes almost a lifetime, but even so manages to bury Rita, the
Arm, and the V1 in its wreckage.  The shaker escapes.
        At this point, the explosive and thermite in the mock palace fail
to go off.  (And perhaps a good thing, too -- the thermite was suspended over
some gasoline.)  The palace does, however, get pulled out of the
fountain towards the audience, collapsing in yet another pile of picturesque
architectural wreckage, near the remains of the V1.

        So.  Lots of stuff didn't work, or broke.  The [your choice of
expletive here] electrical system just wasn't cut out for an SRL show.
We didn't have time to figure this out, since we only got all the pieces
for it 12 hours before the show.  Next time, we will bring our own
cables, breaker boxes, and such.  It would be nice to find a free
generator, too.  Things were too wet to burn well.  The site was good,
but small.  The machines mostly ran OK, but not brilliantly.  We did,
however, ruin some very expensive clothing -- this was brought up at a
post-show press conference by an irate arts patron.
        The day after the show was relaxing and fun.  We used the Big
Arm to demolish the remains of the set.  We terrorized some random
tourists and security guards with the V1.  We accidentally spilled
gasoline in one of the fountains, and even more accidentally ignited it.
We connected the tesla coil to the rail gun power supply and turned them
both on -- remember, Research is our middle name.
        I give the show a B- or C+, depending on my mood.  It will
produce some good video moments, but there was too much dead time during the
live version, and not enough traumatic action.

        Next show, which will try to be a ritual exorcism of sorts,
will probably be in San Francisco in late May.

I usually straighten out the paragraphs, but I left these as is on the
theory that perhaps some obscure artistic purpose was being served.  (No
doubt jym dyer will be able to penetrate the meaning.)

Is it really the right thing to make an artist like the Big Arm do practical
work like striking the set?  I guess it's sort of like using the elephants
to unload the circus train, part of the general spectacle.

        Aside from the fact that one stern word from him in July probably
        would have prevented the whole thing, you'd have to say that Bush
        sure pulled this one off.  I said to someone, "Murphy didn't show
        up."  He replied, "He was working for the other side."

        The "lesson" vis a vis Vietnam is nothing more complicated than

        Unsung praise department:  It's also easier to fight a war with the
        Goldwater-Nichols Act in place.  This law keeps the president out
        of the tactics business.  LBJ was actually telling the air force
        how many rockets to load up for every mission.  The act also
        establishes that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff reports
        to the the president and the other chiefs of staff don't.  This
        cuts back on interservice rivalry.  Finally, the act establishes
        that the field commander is the field commander and that the field
        commander reports to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.

                                    =*=

        I wouldn't suggest for a minute that soldiers who haven't been shot
        at aren't important, and I know this is a little late, but it's
        easy to tell the difference between soldiers who've served in
        combat and those who haven't.  A soldier wears the patch of his
        current unit on his left sleeve at the shoulder.  If he's been in a
        combat outfit, he wears the patch of that unit on his right
        shoulder.  Furthermore, if the soldier has actually served under
        fire, you'll see on his left breast the Combat Infantryman's Badge,
        which is about three inches long, baby blue (the infantry color)
        with a silver wreath around it and a silver rifle on it.  This is
        not a medal.  It's a badge of honor.

This person must have been  trying to find out if he qualified for the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
&gt;From an add in a career publication aimed at college students:

The minimum qualifications for the Special Agent position are:

- Be a U.S. citizen

- Be at least 21 years of age and not older than 34 at appointment

- Be in excellent physical condition

- Have a valid driver's license and ability to drive a vehicle at
  maximum highway speeds

- Have unconrrected vision of not less than 20/200 in both eyes,
  corrected 20/20 in one eye and 20/40 in the other

- Be willing to relocate to another city in the United States

- A college degreee in any field and one year of experience
  conducting criminal investigations or comparable experience

  OR

  A college degree in any field and one of the following:

  - 2.95 (or better) overall grade point average

  - 2.95 (or better) GPA in final two years

  - 3.5 GPA in major field of study

  - Standing in the upper 1/3 of class or major subdivision

  - Membership in scholastic honor society

  - One year of graduate study

Perhaps they should re-order the qualifications to put the vision or
academic standards ahead of the maximum driving speeds part.

I have a similar story [to that of Rocco Morabito, whom you must
remember from a few years back -- ed.], not quite so charming, but, if
anything, a little more scary when I think of it.  I learned to drive
at age 8.  I lived on a dairy farm with about 100 acres of open hay
fields.  My father [a lawyer, not a farmer] bought a 1926 Chevrolet
delivery van ($20) for my amusement.  Soon I was lurching around,
mindless of rocks, ruts or woodchuck holes.  Things went quite well
until I decided to show off my prowess for my 75-year old great aunt,
Bet, who accepted my invitation for a run up to the top of the hill
beyond the barn.  Outbound was fine, but as I was backing around to
return, the passenger door came unlatched.  [It had no proper handle,
only one of those little screen door hooks.]  Aunt Bet, who had been
holding tight to the door, swung out along with it.  I was so
mezmerized by the sight of old Aunt Bet, swinging back and forth, feet
in the cab, hands clasped around the open window, that I froze.  The
old Chevy was whining in reverse straight toward a deep culvert.  My
sister, who was riding on the running board on my side, and saw all
this unfolding and saved the day.  She screamed for me to stop and I
snapped out of the spell.  I jammed on the brakes and old Bet stopped
swinging.  Calmly she pulled herself up onto the seat, latched the
door and turned to us, looking back at her with gaping mouths.  "What
are you all staring at?" she said.  "Let's go home!"  We drove the
rest of the way in silence.

I get a sick feeling in my stomach whenever I think of it,
even after all these years.  Aunt Bet lived to be 89, by the way.

Concord, N.H.  A 400-acre farm, 1.5 miles from the State House plaza, bought
at auction in 1895 for $4,000 by my Great Grand Father, John Jordan, who
had seven children, only one of whom married [my grandmother], all of whom
lived their entire lives on the farm.  The eldest had the honor of sitting
in a great leather chair to read the evening paper.  It was called the
YoureAGonner chair, pronounced "Yuragonnah".

The chair is gone now, but my sister sits on a more modern version of it,
watching her color TV under the oil portrait of John Jordan, who accepted
it from the local impoverished portraitist in lieu of cash for his milk
bill.

This happened in '87 or '88, I think.  Rocco achieved a lot of
notoriety, and even appeared on the Letterman show.

TOT SHOWS DRIVE TO BE FAMILY'S BIG WHEEL

Associated Press

RYE, N.Y. - It seems that 5-year-old Rocco Morabito was just following
family tradition when he took his baby sister for a 1-1/2-mile ride in
the family station wagon during rush hour yesterday morning.

After all, the precocious toddler's granddad and great-uncle were
driving when they were 6 or 7, a family member said.

Officer Robert Vogel was having coffee at a deli on a busy four-lane
road when a bus driver, David Cassera, ran in shortly after 7 a.m. to
announce that he had seen a child driving a car.

Vogel spotted the tan car "weaving ever so slightly" at about 20
m.p.h. and flipped on his lights and siren.  "The car immediately
pulled over to the curb, and didn't even hit the curb.  It was a
beautiful job of pulling the car over," he said.

The child, who could barely see over the dashboard, had the automatic
seat pulled all the way up and the steering wheel down, Vogel said.

However, as the 3-foot-tall Rocco started to get out on the passenger
siade, Vogel realized that the transmission was not in park and he
reached in to stop the rolling car.  Rocco and his 2-year-old sister,
Brandy, then began crying and calling for their mother, Vogel said.

Rocco and his sister were taken to the police station, where their
granddad awaited.

Police said Rocco got the keys from his mother's pocketbook, which was
atop the family's refrigerator, then opened a locked garage door and
backed the station wagon down a narrow 80-foot driveway bounded by a
house and a fence.

Brandy followed Rocco and was only taken for the ride after an
argument, Vogel said.

Subj:   enlightenment through unix

Unix teaches us about the tranistory nature of all things, thus
ridding us of samsaric attachments and hastening enlightenment.  For
instance, while trying to make sense of an X initialization script
someone had given me, I came across a line that looked like an
ordinary unix shell command with the term "exec" prefaced to it.
Curious as to what exec might do, I typed "exec ls" to a shell window.
It listed a directory, then proceeded to kill the shell and every
other window I had, leaving the screen almost totally black with a
tiny white inactive cursor hanging at the bottom to remind me that
nothing is absolute and all things partake of their opposite.

In the past I might have gotten upset or angry at such an occurance.
That was before I found enlightenment through Unix.  Now, I no longer
have attachments to my processes.  Both processes and the disapperance
of processes are illusory.  The world is unix, unix is the world,
labor ceaslessly for the salvation of all sentient beings.

Subj:   a view from Europe - something the desperadi might find interesting

I got the following Christmas letter from my brother-in-law who's been
living in Stuttgart since the early '70's.  I enjoyed reading a first-hand
view of how last year's political changes in eastern Europe have affected
life in Europe.  I thought Desperado's readers might find it interesting too.

A lot has changed this past year.  If you keep your ears open downtown, you
can hear many strange dialects.  Whereas we only used to hear Swabisch, the
local dialect, in varying degrees all the way up to proper German; now you can
hear the Saxons from former East Germany, Poles and Czechs.  Hundreds of
thousands have made their way over here after forty years behind barbed
wire fences.  The economy here is booming, apartments are almost impossible
to find, used cars are hundreds of Marks more expensive, and the less
expensive models have all been shipped east.  The government is spending
hundreds of millions of Marks to try to get the former East Germans to stay
where they are.  It is an invasion, not with guns like in Kuwait, but with
millions of people on the move westwards.  Millions of Russians are on the
verge of starvation as the communist society crumbles, and the free market
ideas imported from the West haven't taken hold yet.  The old and privileged
guard is trying very hard to resist the new changes, withholding food and
causing millions to hunger.  The Red Cross and many private initiatives are
moving hundreds of millions of Marks in aid and CARE packages to Russia,
where the winter snows have already started.  The older generation here
gratefully remembers the CARE packages which were sent here from the U.S.
after WWII.  In Stuttgart, the Newspaper has already collected over a
million Marks in donations.  In the Killesberg exhibition halls volunteer
helpers are packing a truck convoy with thousands of packages to be distributed
in a town near Chernobyl where many people suffer from radiation diseases.
Christian's class at school painted pictures and wrote notes in Russian.
Other classes are going to help pack the CARE packages.  In the newspaper
there has been a lively discussion as to what should be included in the
packages.  The newspaper wrote that they planned to include: flour, rice,
sugar, coffee, chocolate bars, soap bars, and cans of meat and fish.  The
first packages were already packed when protests came from the readers.
They wrote, don't put in any rice, in Russia they eat buckwheat.  OK -
rice out - buckwheat in.  And then someone wrote that the Russians don't drink
coffee, they drink tea in their samowar.  OK - coffee out - tea in.  Last
but not least an old lady wrote; For heaven's sake don't put soap in the
same box as flour.  The flour will windup tasting like soap!  OK - soap
bars out - bottles of liquid soap in.  Now we are afraid that they will
try and drink the soap, having never seen or heard of liquid soap before.
Guenther, a friend of mine here, said that when the CARE packages came when he
was a child, they had no idea what to do with the chewing gum that was in
them.

                         Superloos Reveal All
                            by Graeme Smith

    Vandals who tangle with a new (pounds) 50,000 superloo in Aberdeen
    face the prospect of having their misdemeanours revealed to all.
    [A loo is like a public rest room in the USA --mjt]

    Apparently the most advanced convenience in the world allows
    undesirables just 1.7 seconds of misbehaviour before it throws open
    its door to reveal their misdemeanours and sprays them with violet
    coloured dye which will remain on their skin for at least five
    weeks.

    If, however, you are there for legitimate purposes it will allow you
    15 minutes of luxury for just 10p. The air is perfumed, as well as
    heated, there is background music to help you relax and there are
    special facilities for the disabled and for baby changing.

    When you have completed your business and safely departed the
    superloo spruces itself up for the next customer. The walls, floor
    and WC automatically wash themselves down and when the disinfecting
    cycle is completed the WC is dried with warm air.

    It is careful to ensure that thrifty Aberdonians do not try to sneak
    in two at a time to half the cost, or for any other purpose. It will
    happily allow a mother with children and a pram to enter but if two
    adults step inside, the computerised equipment which the importers
    claim is sensitive enough to tell the size of your shoes, will
    prevent the door closing.

    Three have been commissioned in Aberdeen this week, one in Byron
    Square in Northfield, one in a layby on the Stonehaven road on the
    outskirts of the city, and the third at North Deeside Road.

                       Spam Tater-Tot Velveeta De-lites

"Served hot or cold, this savory party favorite is sure to be the last snack
on the tray!"

Serves 3 - 103

         1 can SPAM                  1 loaf Velveeta
         1 bag Tater Tots            1 bunch of decorative Toothpicks

        1. Arrange Tater Tots on cookie sheet and bake, as directed on the bag,
at 450 for 20 minutes or until crisp, golden-brown, and appealing.  (It's
probably best to play it safe here and just do them for the 20 minutes.)

        0. I forgot to tell you:  You've got to pre-heat the oven first.

        2. Slice the Spam into thin slices which would be about large enough
each to put one Tater Tot on top of, taking into account shrinkage due to
frying.

        3. Fry the Spam slices until they're resistant, in the Italian phrase,
"to the teeth."

        4. Slice the Velveeta into thin slices which would be about large
enough to secure over a Tater Tot resting on a slice of fried Spam with a
decorative toothpick before melting.

        5. Arrange the slices of fried Spam on another cookie sheet.  On
each, place a Tater Tot and then a Velveeta slice, securing the arrangement
with a decorative toothpick.  Bake at 300 for 10 minutes, or until the
Velveeta has melted over the Tater Tots and onto the fried Spam, the cookie
sheet, and the oven floor.

        6. Garnish with gherkins, capers, carrot curls, celery stalks, cucumber
sticks, and radish florets, and enjoy.  If you're serving them cold and
congealed, try a warm Wesson-and-salt dip.

Haiku poems use
just seventeen syllables
to say everything.

For those of you who know what haiku is, you may find this amusing...  If you
don't, and want to know what I found so funny, let me know and I'll tell you.
(Yes, I guess this is Monday-morning boredom...)

what kind of person
would want to count syllables
just to write haiku?

        Somebody was trying to explain Desperado (to me, actually) and
        at the end of a number of twists and turns in the conversation,
        touching on sporadicity and the regularity of some other rival
        net-rags came out with the observation that "Desperado is more
        amusing than it is frequent."  So true.  I hope.

        I found the rock'n'roll hall of fame piece, but it's hopelessly
        lodged in #3046.  I mean, really, hopeless.

        Somebody (not the same body) explained to me that software people
        count from zero, but hardware people count from one.  That makes so
        much sense.  If it's not there, it takes software to count it.
