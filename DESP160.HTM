Well, you know it must be summer when I start sneezing and printing trip
reports. On that subj:, may I say that if I see even one more DECUS trip
report, I am going to track down the perpetrators and wring their necks,
regardless of their age or sex. Except for this one:

  Observations from discussions with customers at DECUS in Nashville:

&lt; deletion &gt;

There was the FS guy who made an Ethernet tap at the wrong point, so he decided
to refill the hole in the cable with solder.

Also a terminal server in a closet that crashed nightly at 3AM. After trying
everything else he could think of for a week or so, the consultant sat in the
closet one night waiting for something to happen. At 3AM the door opened a
crack and a hand reached past him and unplugged the server. This rather
startled our hero, and had an even more serious effect on the server. He jumped
out and yelled, which rather startled the cleaning lady who plugged her vacuum
cleaner into that plug every night.

The tendre croppes, and and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram his halve cours yroone,
And smale foweles maken melodye,

And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,
To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes."

                 ITINERARY - 1987 RAMP TOUR

Friday, April 24

    Begin driving, if you can, any time from 3-6 p.m. Route 51, the
nightmare on Elm Street of all streets will carry you south toward Uniontown.
Thirteen miles out of town, on your left, ou'll see the historic Large Hotel,
in operation since 1903. This will be the first stop for early-leaving ramp
travelers. After you'be cut the dust at the Hotel Large, continue south on 51,
through the town of Perryopolis, and past the hamelts of Smock, Upper
Middletown, and Searights. Searights, of course, was a lang grant in the
new world from Philip II of Spain to our great (many times) grand-uncle,
Romero Raffoon, an Irish sea captain who sailed with the Armada against
the English. On this jaunt south you'll pass lions and bears on rooftops,
Gene and Boots' white candy, and a sigh featuring "Party Entertainment and
Tomatoes by the bushel." Some party, I bet. Check for additional photographic
reference in the forthcoming "Ramp Shots", by Lao-Tsu Raffoon.

As you reach the outskirts of Untiontown, be alert to take the 119 South
bypass, which sweeps off to your right as soon as you pass Collier's tire
service. Follow the bypass to Route 857 South, which jogs left first then right
at the decrepit Sycamore Hotel. On to Fairchance.

       "Outside in the distance a wild cat
        did growl, two riders were approaching,
        the wind began to howl."

A hush of expectancy has descended on the town of Fairchance. When we last
left Betty Lou Rafail, owner of the Bank Tavern, she turned to her barman
and said, "Now you get ready. In another month the Ramp Hunters will be
here." The Ramp Hunters! Some whisper that they're the devil spawn of an Injun
and a wolf. The Ramp Hunters! Thundering into town, you'll pass St. Cyril
and Methodius Church, where they'll have look-outs in the belfry. Watch for
the Keyston (no "e") gas station on your right, and dive immediately left on
Church Street to the Bank Tavern. The Bank has survived bankruptcy and a
kangaroo court, and will be ready with cold Stoney's drafts and cheap whiskey.
Drink shooters. Shoot pool.

Around 7 p.m., try the road again. Still on 857 South, pass through the
village of White House. Darkness falls as you search for Foxie's Lulu Bell
Inn, on your right. The Lulu Bell is a rough-and-tumble hootchie-kootchie
bar, inhabited by badasses, bikers, and women with tattoos. They look
forward to our coming. Sign for your club cards, and make conversation
with the dancers. This is the place where new Raffoons are made, with anointing
with a seven-year-old bottle of Rebel Yell and some festering ramps.

Shortly pas the Lulu Bell, turn to the right at Lakeview Country Club, pass
Ruby and Ketchy's newly-remodeled place on the left, and trun down to the
waterside and hum across the Low Cheat bridge. Old rampers know the way.
Wave as you pass Johnnie's Texaco. You're on "Cheat Road", where you may
have been once, twice, a dozen times before. Follow the signs to Morgantown,
home of the Flame Steakhouse and the rockin' Omni.

Play it by ear late Friday night. Sing and dance.

2 a.m. Sweet dreams of the ramp.

Saturday, April 25

South of the Mason-Dixon, we usually start with a sizeable breakfast, if one
can be found. There may be a few likely places in Morgantown, where the
retail shops are always looking for ramp tourists with money in their pockets.
By early afternoon, take Route 7 east across the bridge, and be alert to
juke left up hill at Buck's tavern and frontier post. Strike for Belington.
Remember not to stick your head out of the car at a hundred miles an hour,
or you'll get your eyes blown out.

In Belington, our base camp is the Mid-Town Motel. Color TV. In the
afternoon, buy fresh ramps at the Shop 'n' Save or IGA, and prepare to cruise
down to the VFW (special Viet Nam chapter). Social memberships have been
renewed for the Victory Room, and new ones cost $13. More adventurous and
foolhardy types may choose to strap on pistols and pay a visit to the
Desperado Club. At least the local guys are polite enough to ask "Are those
your women?" before they try to take them.

Get ready by mid-afternoon for the ride through Junior, and where 92
hits the "T" intersection, turn right and then dodge
quickly left toward Norton. Be alert to head for Mabie and Cassity,
and consult your "Ramp Shot" Baedeker for roadsigns and landmarks. The
roads through Randolph County are the best they've ever been. Follow
the Helvetia Road.

The great Ramp Dinner in Helvetia begins around 3 p.m. Food for the spirit,
we have raw and parbroiled ramps, soup beans, home fries, country cole slaw,
hot corn bread, and platters of ham from pigs that died happy. Served family
style. If you come later, prepare to stand in line. Through dusk, explore
Randolph County or take naps. Swill bourbon from bottles and prepare for
circle dancing, or visit with the old Raffoons, who will be staying at a
rustic inn.

When you want to, head back over the mountains to Belington. The sky will
be dark during the New Moon, so be careful in the hollows. There's always
room back at the V.F.W., and there may be a band playing up in Elkins,
or a hot nite spot to visit in Phillippi. At the motel there may be occurences
of a particularly satanic habit, the ritualistic ramp whipping. The lash of the
ramp brings hot blood to the surface, and causes some to speak in tongues.
Chance meetings all night long. Hoot and holler. Make eyes.

Sunday Morning, April 26

Wake slowly, and with raccoon eyes, watch whatever evangelist happens to be
left after the sex wars on motel TV. Breakfast at Bucklews's, across the
street, home of fresh-baked cream pie. Embrace in the parking lot, shouting
final prophecies. Back onto the high roads. Blossoms and blue smoke.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I feel it's only fair to tell you what ramps are. They are not  short bends,
slopes or curves, but one of the alliums, used for food. Fiery, garlicky,
and tasting of spring in the mountains.

And as long as we're on the subject of television evangelists, tell me
what PTL stands for.  Give up? Pay the Lady!

The day after I got back from DECUS in Nashville, the New York Times had an
article about a Ray Stevens country-western song about the Bakker scandal,
called "Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show":

    Woke up this morning, turned on my TV set.
    There in living color was something I can't forget.
    This man was preachin' at me, yeah, layin' on the charm,
    Askin' me for 20 with 10,000 on his arm.

    He wore designer clothing and a big smile on his face,
    Selling me salvation while they sang "Amazin' Grace,"
    Askin' me for money when he had all the signs of wealth.
    I almost wrote a check out, but then I asked myself.

    Would He wear a pinkie ring? Would He drive a fancy car?
    Would His wife wear furs and diamonds? Would His dressing room have a star?
    If He came back tomorrow, there's something I'd like to know.
    Can you tell me, would Jesus wear a Rolex on His television show?

    Would Jesus be political if He came back to Earth?
    Have His second home in Palm Springs and try to hide His worth?
    Take money from those poor folks when He comes back again?
    And admit He's talked to all those preachers who say they've been
        talkin' to Him?

Associated Press Wed 27-MAY-1987 05:21                        Lightning Death

27-MAY-87

       `HERE I AM!,' Man Reportedly Says Before Bolt Strikes Him Dead
    BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) - A man standing in the stern of his new
    boat raised his hands, looked skyward and declared, ``Here I am,''
    just before a lightning bolt struck him dead, authorities said.
    Graves Thomas, a 40-year-old Shreveport attorney, died of
    electrocution on Memorial Day, forensic pathologist Dr. George
    McCormick said Tuesday.

    There was no thunder, lightning or sign of lightning before the
    killer bolt struck, said Dan Rusell Jr., one of four friends in the
    boat with Thomas on Lake Bisteneau east of here Monday.
    Thomas' last words were reported by one of the four, said
    Bossier Parish Sheriff's Deputy Scott Hodges, but he refused to say
    which one.

    At the time, Thomas had agreed to represent a man charged with
    reckless operation of a boat in connection with a May 17 collision
    that resulted in three deaths on the lake.

    Russell said Thomas had finished clearing debris from the boat's
    propeller and checking the speedometer when ``I heard very loud
    thunder and at the same time electricity ran through my left arm
    and left leg.''

    He said he turned and saw Thomas topple into the boat.
    Russell and three women, including one who had been in the water
    preparing to ski, rushed Thomas to shore.

    Dr. Denny Gamble, who was on a houseboat nearby, said he tried
    to revive Thomas for more than an hour while awaiting an ambulance.
    The group continued working on Thomas after putting him into a
    station wagon and heading toward Bossier City to meet the
    ambulance, Gamble said, but Thomas was pronounced dead at a Bossier
    City hospital.

    ``He just got the boat last week, and he's been out with it just
    about every night after work,'' said Lisa Hester, Thomas' secretary.
    Thomas came from a family of prominent Louisiana judges and
    lawyers, and his cases regularly made headlines.

    His full name was Nathaniel Graves Thomas III, but he used his
    middle name personally and professionally.

        _Unified_Field_Theory_ -- Tim Joseph

        In the beginning there was Aristotle,
        And objects at rest tended to remain at rest,
        And objects in motion tended to come to rest,
        And soon everything was at rest,
        And God saw that it was boring.

        Then God created Newton,
        And objects at rest tended to remain at rest,
        But objects in motion tended to remain in motion,
        And energy was conserved and momentum was conserved
                and matter was conserved,
        And God saw that it was conservative.

        Then God created Einstein,
        And everything was relatvie,
        And fast things became short,
        And straight things became curved,
        And the universe was filled with inertial frames,
        And God saw that it was relatively general, but some of it
                was especially relative.

        Then God created Bohr,
        And there was the principle,
        And the principle was quantum,
        And all things were quantified,
        But some things were still relative,
        And God saw that it was confusing.

        Then God was going to create Furgeson,
        And Furgeson would have unified,
        And he would have fielded a theory,
        And all would have been one,
        But it was the seventh day,
        And God rested,
        And objects at rest tend to remain at rest.

   "God, the superbeing who created a universe of some 200 billion
    galaxies --- comprising approximately 200 billion stars per galaxy
    --- the same God who created the atom, designed gravity and ignited
    the spark of life...who conceived of the infinite wonders of time
    and space from the smallest, subatomic particle...to the largest and
    most durable sun...This God talks to ORAL ROBERTS???  Never to an
    Isaac Newton or a Leonardo Da Vinci or a Mozart or even an Albert
    Einstein!  But He takes the time to talk to ORAL ROBERTS???"

John, just a couple of random comments on the latest DESPERADUM, if you
can stand them:

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

    My friend and another guy were in a heated practical joke war.
    My friend, Steve, was a wiz at finesse.  The other fellow, Jack,
    was a wiz at...well...sledgehammer humor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

An interesting transition from "whiz" to "wiz." Even slang isn't
impervious, apparently. "Whiz" (the original form) refers to someone
who was quick, speedy..."wiz" of course is short for wizard.

Of course it could also be the case that the writer simply misspelled
"whiz"! And let's not get into the modern meaning of "whiz"...

Subj:   Mother's day

Newsgroups: rec.humor
Posted: 6 May 87 03:33:29 GMT
Subject: Mother's Day: To the best Comp Sci Instructor ever

           MOTHER'S DAY MEDITATIONS FROM THE COMPUTER ROOM.

A friend recently asked me what training it takes to work with
computers.  I gave a brief answer mentioning some college courses,
some on-the-job training, and a long time in the school of hard knocks.
But upon reflection, I realize that most of my training in fundamental
computer concepts came from my mother.

When I was a baby, mother taught me about input buffering: "Don't try to
stuff all your food in your mouth at once.  Leave it on your plate until
you're ready to eat it, and then take it in one mouthful at a time."

She also taught me about processing the entire input buffer before going on
to the next step: "Eat everything on your plate.  Then you can have
dessert."

(It will occur to some readers that mother also taught me about output
buffering, but I'd like to keep these meditations G-rated.)

When I was about four, mother introduced the concept of sequentially
executed instructions: "We're going to set the table."  (That's
identification of the procedure.)  "First put the table cloth on the table.
Check it to make sure it's straight.  Then put a plate at each place.  Then
put a cup at each place.  Then ..."

Later, mother introduced the concept of a procedure call: "We're going to
have dinner.  Please set the table."

Still later, when I was about 14, mother would set up tasks for me and use
"job control language" in a note on the refrigerator door: "We're going to
have dinner at 6:00.  You make it when you get home from school.  The menu
is pinned up on the bulletin board, the meat is in the refrigerator, and
I've put the rest of the food out on the counter.  Set an extra place -
Uncle Jack is coming tonight."

Mother demonstrated what it means to multi-process:  She could deal with the
interruptions of four children (those were the real-time, foreground tasks)
while doing the housework (as a background task).

Mother used the concept of hierarchical storage for her cooking tools.  The
cooking forks and spoons were hung on hooks right by the stove.  The
potato slicer and the egg beater, which weren't used for every meal, were
kept in a drawer.  And the big roaster, which she only used once a year to
cook the Thanksgiving turkey, was kept in the storage closet in the basement.

Once we had about fourteen people for Thanksgiving dinner, and our kitchen
seemed too small for the job.  That's when mother introduced the concept of
backing store.  She cleared off the ping-pong table in the rec room next to
the kitchen and laid out all her ingredients on one side of the net.  My
sister and I fetched things from the "input" side of the ping-pong table as
mother called for them, carried partially finished dishes to and from
the "backing store" on the other side of the net, and delivered finished
food to the "output" dining table.

This system worked well, until my sister and I collided in the doorway
between the two rooms and we nearly lost the creamed onions.  Mother solved
this problem of "channel contention" by establishing a protocol:  "First
say 'May I come through?' and then wait until you get the answer 'Yes; it's
clear.'"

It was also in the kitchen that mother taught me about looping and testing:
"Cook the fudge, while stirring it, and test it every couple of minutes to
see if it's done.  You test it by dropping a bit of it in the cold water.
When it forms a soft ball, it's done."

For years I badgered my mother with questions about whether Santa Claus is a
real person or not.  Her answer was always "Well, you asked for the presents
and they came, didn't they?"  I finally understood the full meaning of her
reply when I heard the definition of a virtual device:  "A software or
hardware entity which responds to commands in a manner indistinguishable
from the real device."  Mother was telling me that Santa Claus is a virtual
person (simulated by loving parents) who responds to requests from children
in a manner indistinguishable from the real saint.

Mother also taught the IF ... THEN ... ELSE structure:  "If it's snowing,
then put your boots on before you go to school; otherwise just wear your
shoes."

Mother explained the difference between batch and transaction processing:
"We'll wash the white clothes when we get enough of them to make a load,
but we'll wash these socks out right now by hand because you'll need them
this afternoon."

Mother understood about parity errors.  When she counted socks after doing
the laundry, she expected to find an even number and groaned when only one
sock of a pair emerged from the washing machine.  Later she applied the
principles of redundancy engineering to this problem by buying our socks
three identical pairs at a time.  This greatly increased the odds of being
able to come up with at least one matching pair.

Mother had all of us children write our Christmas thank you notes to
Grandmother, one after another, on a single large sheet of paper which was
then mailed in a single envelope with a single stamp.  This was obviously
an instance of blocking records in order to save money by reducing the
number of physical I/O operations.

Mother knew about devices which raise an interrupt signal to be serviced
when they have completed any operation.  She had a whistling teakettle.

Mother understood about LIFO ordering.  In my lunch bag she put the dessert
on the bottom, the sandwich in the middle, and the napkin on top so that
things would come out in the right order at lunchtime.

There is an old story that God knew He couldn't be physically present
everywhere at once, to show His love for His people, and so He created
mothers.  That is the difference between centralized and distributed
processing.  As any kid who's ever misbehaved at a neighbor's house finds
out, all the mothers in the neighborhood talk to each other.  That's a
local area network of distributed processors that can't be beat.

Happy Mother's Day, Mom.  You were the best computer teacher I ever had.

                   ALL I EVER REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW
                       I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN

                           BY Robert Flughum
                          Seattle, Washington

    Most of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to
do, and how to be, I learned in kindergarten.  Wisdom was not at the
top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sandbox at
nursery school.

    These are the things I learned:  Share everything. Play fair.
Don't hit people.  Put things back where you found them.  Clean up
your own mess.  Don't take things that aren't yours.  Say you're sorry
when you hurt somebody.  Wash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm
cookies and cold milk are good for you.  Live a balanced life.  Learn
some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and
work every day some.

    Take a nap every afternoon.  When you go out into the world, watch
for traffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.
Remember the little seed in the plastic cup.  The roots go down and
the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all
like that.

    Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in
the plastic cup - they all die.  So do we.

    And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word
you learned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.  Everything you need to
know is in there somewhere.  The Golden Rule and love and basic
sanitation.  Ecology and politics and sane living.

    Think of what a better world it would be if we all - the whole
world - had cookies and milk about 3 o'clock every afternoon and then
lay down with our blankets for a nap.  Or if we had a basic policy in
our nation and other nations to always put things back where we found
them and cleaned up our own messes.  And it is still true, no matter
how old you are, when you go out into the world, it is best to hold
hands and stick together.

      ITALIAN SCIENTISTS CONFIRM APEMAN CAN BE CREATED

      by Uli Schmetzer (Chicago Tribune, May 14, 1987)

     ROME- The image of the mad  scientist  with  the  white
beard  concocting an apeman in his laboratory is no longer a
science fiction fable but a 1987 possibility.

     An  Italian  anthropologist   said   this   week   that
biogenetic  scientists,  using refined techniques of artifi-
cial fertilization, are capable of creating a new  breed  of
slave,  an  anthropoid  with a chimpanzee mother and a human
father.

     Brunetto Chiarelli, dean of  anthropology  at  Florence
University, said the experiments on the new subhuman species
had been interrupted at the embryo stage because of "ethical
problems".

     The professor said the  experiments  had  been  kept  a
secret.   He  did  not know the name of the laboratories but
thought that in the United States and  other  countries  the
cross-breeding of a female chimpanzee, fertilized with human
male sperm, had resulted in the formation of  an  anthropoid
embryo.

     "Scientific  information  is  numerous  but   reserved.
Maybe  at  the  end of the year we will have an idea of what
has been achieved," he said.

     Chiarelli suggested that the new species could be  used
"for labor chores that are repetitive and disagreeable... or
as a reservoir for transplant organs."

     The professor also said that  at  Florence  University,
researchers  had  successfully  crossed  two species of ape,
gibbon and siamang.  "These two species are genetically more
diverse than man and ape," Chiarelli added.

     The idea of an army of apeman slaves cleaning  streets,
placing nuts and bolts on assembly line products, or waiting
in cages to have their vital organs cut out came as a  shock
to clergy and scientists.

     Though Italian scientists agreed that  it  was  techni-
cally  possible,  they doubted that any such experiments had
been carried to their natural conclusion: the  birth  of  an
apeman baby.

     Church leaders recalled that the  Vatican  only  a  few
weeks ago had condemned genetic experimentation.

     "The idea is bestial  and  repugnant,"  commented  Rita
Levi Montalcini, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for Physics.

     "Any such initiative must be  blocked  at  once,"  said
Prof.  Arturo Falaschi, director of the Genetic Institute at
Pavia University.

     But other Italian scientists agreed  that  with  modern
techniques,  the  idea  is  feasible.  They also pointed out
that the first apeman experiments were carried out in  Paris
in  the  mid  1930s with what one professor called "the most
crude methods".

     "As far as I know, nothing has been  published  on  the
subject,  although  one cannot exclude that some experiments
have not been made public," said Alberto Piazza, director of
the Institute of Genetics at Turin University.

     "I ask myself, however, what would be the scope of such
experiments?  To create an army of slaves?"

     What worried many  genetic  researchers  was  that  any
adverse  publicity  could  slow  experiments  on the cure of
hereditary illnesses and genetic defects with new  selective
fertilization methods.

              No More Mickey Mouse Votes In Georgia
   ATLANTA (AP) - Mickey Mouse would no longer be able to receive
legal votes in Georgia elections under a bill passed Monday by the
state Senate.
   The cartoon character is a popular choice of voters who choose
to write in a name rather than vote for a candidate on the ballot.
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Max Brannon, would direct election
officials not to include in official totals any write-in vote not
cast for a person who filed a notice of a write-in candidacy.
   The Senate passed the bill by a 49-2 vote, after adding an
amendment which would allow election officials not to hold general
elections when only one party has a nominee and no write-in
candidate has filed a notice. The bill now goes to the House.

THE CAT &amp; DUCK METHOD OF IFR FLYING:

        Today's flight age is an era highlighted with increasing emphasis
on safety.  Instrumentation in the cockpit and in the traffic control tower
has reached new peaks of electronic perfection to assist the pilot during
take-offs, flight, and landings.  For whimsical contrast to these and other
marvels of scientific flight engineering, it is perhaps opportune to remind
pilots of the basic rules concerning the so-called Cat-and-Duck Method of
Flight, just in case something goes wrong with any of these new-fangled
flying instruments you find in today's aircraft.
        Place a live cat on the cockpit floor.  Because a cat always remains
upright, he or she can be used in lieu of a needle and ball.  Merely watch to
see which way the cat leans to determine if a wing is low and, if so, which
one.
        The duck is used for the instrument approach and landing.  Because
any sensible duck will refuse to fly under instrument conditions, it is only
necessary to hurl your duck out of the plane and follow her to the ground.
        There are some limitations to the Cat-and-Duck Method, but by rigidly
adhering to the following check list, a degree of success will be achieved.

1.      Get a wide-awake cat.  Most cats do not want to stand up at all, at
        any time.  It may be necessary to get a large fierce dog in the
        cockpit to keep the cat at attention.

2.      Make sure your cat is clean.  Dirty cats will spend all their time
        washing.  Trying to follow a cat licking itself usually results in
        a tight snap roll, followed by an inverted (or flat) spin.  You can
        see this is very unsanitary.

3.      Old cats are best.  Young cats have nine lives, but an old used-up
        cat with only one life left has just as much to lose an you do and
        will therefore be more dependable.

4.      Avoid stray cats.  Try to get one with a good pedigree.  Your vet
        can help you locate a cat with good character, or try the Cat
        Breeders' Association.

5.      Beware of cowardly ducks.  If the duck discovers that you are using
        the cat to stay upright - or straight and level- she will refuse to
        leave without the cat.  Ducks are no better on instruments than you
        are.

6.      Be sure the duck has good eyesight.  Nearsighted ducks sometimes will
        go flogging off into the nearest hill.  Very short-sighted ducks will
        not realize they have been thrown out and will descend to the ground
        in a sitting position.  This maneuver is quite difficult to follow in
        an airplane.

7.      Use land-loving ducks.  It is very discouraging to break out and find
        yourself on final approach for some farm pound in Iowa.  Also, the
        farmers there suffer from temporary insanity when chasing crows off
        their corn fields and will shoot anything that flies.

8.      Choose your duck carefully.  It is easy to confuse ducks with geese
        because many water birds look alike.  While they are very competent
        instrument flyers, geese seldom want to go in the same direction you
        do.  If your duck heads off for the Okefenokee Swamp, you may be sure
        you have been given the goose.

Charles Osgood reported the following story on CBS Radio this morning:

Hundreds of cat owners in Chicago received a bill for five dollars
accompanied by a letter explaining that they were required to register
their dachshund.  Apparently the Cook county health department had
provided rabies shots for pets and kept a computerized list of animals
receiving shots.  Someone got the bright idea of matching this list against
the list of dogs licensed in Chicago to find dogs that received shots but
were not licensed.  Cats are not required to have licenses.

Unfortunately, the county uses the code "DHC" to represent "domestic house
cat", while the city of Chicago uses "DHC" to represent "dachshund",
resulting in computer generated form letters to the owners of the "DHCs".
After the mess was discovered, a city official said "I guess if we'd thought
about it, we would have wondered why there were so many dachshunds in Chicago."
(not an exact quote, I couldn't take notes when I heard the story.)
