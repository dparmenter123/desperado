A Czech family has fled to Austria in a home-made hot-air balloon.  The
balloon was made out of rubber raincoats, sewed together.  A small fire
provided the hot air.

To the rat man

Hank,

Once, a long time ago, a friend of mine from Brooklyn said that
they had a serious problem with rats in his neighborhood. They even
went so far as to place a bounty on the rats' heads. Many people
tried, but no one really got enough rat scalps to pay the bills.

One day someone came up with the idea that yeast swells when mixed
with water. What they did was place cakes of yeast around and lots
of water. After a couple of days there were rats exploded around
the neighbohood--messy but effective.

Try it, because their scalps are not worth much today.

Subject: DECmaze

From the Wall Street Journal editorial page - 7 Sept 1983

The Micro Marketplace

Ever wonder what those high-tech folks who brought us Pacman do in
their spare time?  Well, it seems they play video games, and sometimes
not just for fun.  We hear, for example, that at Digital, the maker of
the DECmate minicomputers, engineers have come up with DECmaze, a little
in-house game that pits Digital against brands X - Apple, IBM, Wang and
TRS.  The object is for the DEC player to blast away the bad guys before
getting eaten.  Unlike some video games, this one is realistic:  Even
when the DEC warrior zaps the baddies, the competition retreats just
for a little while, eventually coming back for more.  This of course
keeps all the players on their toes.  It's reassuring to see one
industry that not only lives but also plays by the rules of the market.

Anyone know if this is for real?

Of *course* it's for real.  The question is, is there a *game* like this?
