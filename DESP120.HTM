Subj:   A party book

I was at a fairly wonderful party last weekend, one of the guests
at which was a terrific piano player who could pick out a decent
arrangement of any song that anyone could hum.  As the evening
wore on and the booze ran out, we started singing The Songs of Our
Degenerate Youth.

Or at least we tried.  Problem was that not many people could
remember all the words.  This is not the first party in the last
couple of years at which I've noticed this phenomenon, and I am
certain that I am not alone.  Gatherings of the '60's generation
start out with discussions of mortgage rates or the changing of
careers versus the changing of diapers and end up on the floor
crooning the works of Sam Cooke, Buddy Holly, and The Supremes.

I like the end of the evening much better than the
beginning, and I have long thought that it would be more fun
if everyone was singing the same verse, even if not the same key.
To make this happen, I've considered compiling the lyrics of
the songs that are the best known, best loved, and most singable
by a large, drunken chorus.  Whoever is most sober could
feed the lines to the rest of the group.

After last weekend, I finally decided to do it, and I am asking
you to nominate candidates for this collection.  If you can also
supply the lyrics, that would be extra wonderful.

Be aware that your favorite song might not work.  The "most singable
by a large, drunken chorus" requirement is important.  Songs that have
complicated arrangements or long instrumental parts don't work too well.
I love to dance to "Proud Mary" but I'd rather sing "Bye Bye Love."

Subj:   New opportunities for speech synthesizers

From a recent "Playboy Advisor"

I am unsettled by the recent behavior of my girlfriend.  I have a
personal computer with speech-synthesis capability.  She enjoys
having me program the machine to emit sensuous and very explicit
sexual words and phrases while we make love.  She gets very
turned on by the computer's erotic talk and we have fantastic sex,
but I'm afraid that she may have a mental hang-up about the computer.
When we make love without the synthetic erotic speech, she doesn't seem
to have much desire for or interest in the sex act.  I'm very
worried about her mental health and would like to know whether or
not I should persuade her to seek professional help.  What should
I do?
                                -- Z. B., Quincy, Illinos

Playboy answered as follows:

Is that a floppy disk in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
Using a computer to complete a menage a trois is a little too Orwellian
for our tastes:  Man is, indeed, being replaced, byte by byte.
Sorry.  If your lady can't get turned on when you supply the vocals,
it may just be time to pack it in.  Next time, think twice before
setting up a threesome with the first thing that comes along.

Subj:   Help!

The DECBIGBAND is about to lose a member of the trombone section; unfortunately,
the world-wide supply of good tromobonists is dwindling (they may show up on the
endangered species list any day now). If trombonists in general are a minority,
then gifted jazz trombonists are a tiny subset of that minority...however, on
the basis of "nothing ventured, nothing gained," I'm sending out this SOS to
you, in hopes that you know, or know about, someone who (A) works for DEC,
(B) plays trombone, (C) can improvise as well as read music, and (D), most
important, is willing/able to rehearse with the band every Wednesday night and
perform with us about once a month (on average). IF you know of someone who
is a match (or is even close), please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks.

Subject: Quote .....

        Best quote I know of Churchill's is his reply to a plain and
        rotund lady who said at a social occasion:

        "Mr. Churchill!  You are drunk!"

        Winston's riposte was:

        "Madam, YOU are ugly.  But tomorrow I shall be sober!"

        I think it was also Churchill who first said "Never give a sucker
        an even break", but cannot be certain.

Subj:   At least dams don't sniff Coke

The intelligent Coke machines remind me of something that happened in Utah in
the early 60s.  The Utah Power and Light Company built a dam in a remote moun-
tain canyon, and gave it an autodialer and a recorded message; in an emergency
it would call home and let someone know there was a problem.  No sweat.  The
engineers went home to Salt Lake City and had a Coke (at the time, you couldn't
buy a beer in Salt Lake City).

Time passed.  One day someone at the telephone company noticed (don't ask how)
that one circuit had been kept busy for well over a day; the calls were traced,
and led back to Utah Power and Light's dam.  So they tapped the line, and this
is what they got:

        Dam:            (Dials.)

        Other end:      I'm sorry.  The number you have dialed is not a working
                        number.  Please check your directory and dial again.
                        (Hangs up.)

And it did dial again....  I guess it's not always true that artificial
intelligence is better than no intelligence.

Subj:   Chicken Fight

                  Woman's Yard Overrun By Wild Chickens

                             By JOHN DIAZ
                        Associated Press Writer

  FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Carol Patterson ``didn't see any
chickens'' 11 years ago when she bought her house on a tree-filled
one-acre lot in rural Gloucester County.
   But soon after she planted a garden, wild chickens started
coming out of the woods to peck at her tomatoes, dig out her tulip
bulbs and coat her yard and front porch with droppings.
   Their numbers have increased to the point where Ms. Patterson no
longer allows her children to lie on the living room rug to watch
television because of concern that foot traffic through the front
porch has made it unsanitary.
   ``At this point, I'm getting disgusted,'' said Ms. Patterson,
who estimated that 150 wild chickens regularly strut around her
property.
   She has tried everything to rid her lot of the fowl intruders.
   Many people have suggested she turn the feathered nuisances into
meals.
   ``If somebody wants to make chicken dinners out of them, more
power to them,'' she said. ``I'm ready to have everybody down for a
chicken barbecue ... I'll even do the cooking.''
   But Ms. Patterson ``wouldn't even think'' about eating the
chickens because they have not been innoculated against avian flu,
a recurring poultry disease in the region.
   After failing to get much help from government officials, Ms.
Patterson has turned to what she calls her ``Annie Oakley''
approach.
   ``I'll take the BB gun out every now and then when I get totally
frustrated,'' she said. ``I'll try to scope it out as best I can.
I'm not a very good shot.''
   But when the gunfire subsides, the chickens strut right back.
   Ronald Dixon, the township's animal warden, says the chickens
may have been abandoned by a previous owner and wandered into the
woods several hundred yards behind the house. He said none of the
neighbors has complained about a problem.
   Mayor Astor Giovinazzi said he would introduce an ordinance
restricting chickens. Only pigs and dogs are now prohibited from
running loose.
   Despite it all, Ms. Patterson said she still likes chickens,
although the experience has caused her to cringe when she sees them
approach.
   ``You see a mother coming with five little ones and you think,
`Uh oh, here they go again.'''

Subj:   Take a tree to lunch

Yesterday afternoon, I visited a printer who does a lot of our
stuff.  They have a web-offset press, which you've probably seen
if you've ever watched "Superman" or "Lou Grant," or seen any of
those movies that move the plot along by showing headlines as
they fly off the press.

A web press uses gigantic rolls of paper, which are about 4 feet
high and 4 feet in diameter.  The printer I visited had them in
stacks, four per stack; the storage room was somewhat like being
in a redwood forest.

The VMS doc set was printed on a web press, and I was curious
to know how many of these rolls it took for the first printing.
I recalled something about 10,000 copies (of 13,000 pages), and
I figured that it took 10, maybe 12, rolls.

My estimate was a little off.  Turns out that about 30,000 copies
of the entire set were printed, requiring about 2450 rolls of
paper.  Elaine Trachman, who honchoed much of this stuff for us,
tells me that the printer used an entire trainload of paper.

Sort of makes you want to join the Sierra Club.

I spent Friday at the Boston Glob, visiting our customer site there, and
after a long morning hanging the software out to dry, the Operations Manager
took us on a tour of the facilities, everything from the composing room and
the editorial offices to the composing room and the Press Room.

The Press Room was unbelievable. Every montage you've ever seen by Slavko
Vorkapich in a Frank Capra hearttugger about the freedom of the press is but a
pale adumbration of the real thing! Three stories high, reeking with printer's
ink (far from being in my blood, it gives me a headache), peopled with
burly guys, with beer bellies, wearing tee shirts and saying things like
"Strook'em". And through the press room at about 1-minute intervals came
rumbling great dollies laden with these huge rolls of newsprint, trundling
along on little tracks in the floor. And all this to print page after page
of advertising. I'll tell you one thing -- the only word I DIDN'T hear
in the offices of that newspaper was "news".

Subj:   SAVE AMTRAK --- QUICK!

Ever watch Star Trek? When faced with a seemingly hopeless situation, Dr.
McCoy usually says something like "Spock! Do SOMETHING!" Yes, I'm trying
to get you to intercede on Amtrak's behalf again. WAIT A MINUTE....please
don't press that Find Next key until you hear me out.

I've just heard some very disheartening news. It seems a "compromise"
budget has been worked out which includes NO funding for Amtrak. If something
isn't done about it, come next fall there will be no intercity rail system
in this country. Now, I don't know about you, but I for one think this would
be a real tragedy. If we just stand by and watch it happen, we'll be
perpetually haunted, not only by the ghosts of "Casey Joneses" gone by, but
more by the thought that we won't be able to offer the same wonderful
experiences to our children that our parents gave to us. You know, we railfans
are sometimes criticized for being too nostalgic, for living on past glories
and ignoring the present. Well, here's our chance to prove the critics wrong!

 I know, I know, you have all sorts of reasons for not writing to your
congressman and Senators. OH NO YOU DON'T! "I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO WRITE."
Call your town hall. They'll be delighted to give you the names and addresses
of your elected representatives. Failing that, just write to Senator/
Congressman Xxxxxx Xxxxxx, Senate/House Office Bldg., Washington, DC. It
takes longer that way, but it will get there.

"IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD." Balderdash! As any inhabitant of Capitol Hill will tell
you, when one constituent is mad enough to actually write, there are a dozen
more who think the same way, but are too lazy to do so. It WILL help!

"I NEVER GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS. BESIDES, IT WILL JUST SEEM LIKE I'M
COMPLAINING. THEY'LL THINK I'M SOME NEUROTIC ACROPHOBE!" Well this is a
democratic country, my friend. You not only have a right to complain, you have
a DUTY to provide corrective feedback when a mistake is being made. As for
politics, this is NOT a partisan issue, and keeping the railroads running
does not mean you wish the airlines ill. I myself am both a student pilot and
a two-time Reagan voter. Neither fact will prevent me from attempting to keep
a serious mistake from being made.

"I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WRITE A LETTER. I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYHOW".
Sorry, you don't get off the hook that easy. At the end of this message is
a whole bunch of facts you can use for ammo. Now, it would be best if you sat
down and composed your own letter, but failing that you can edit out the rest
of this message, print it out and send it. Yes, it will cost you 5 minutes and
22 cents to boot. But isn't the future of transportation in this country worth
it?

The time to act is at hand, folks. Take up a petition, write a letter.
Do SOMETHING!
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I have to tell you that I am not a railroad fan. I prefer to go by ship when
the journey offers the opportunity. But I AM an avid fan of participatory
democracy, and this is the most fervent and at the same time practical
exegesis on the subject I have yet read.

And if you do care about AMTRAK, send me a message and I'll forward you
the AMTRAK template.

           Word Star, Word Handler, Word Juggler, Magic Window, Magic
      Wand, Super Text, Super Scribe, Easy Writer, Apple Writer....you've
      drooled over the ads for these legendary word processors, and you
      want one real bad, don't you?  Of course you do!

           Wait!  These programs are for writers.  We're talking about
      Real writers, people like Jerry Pournelle, Stephen King, and
      Barbara Cartland.  Superstars who get published by the big
      publishing houses, who autograph their books at Brentano's, and who
      appear on talk shows.

           What have you written lately?

           A history of the elastic webbing industry in New England?  A
      discussion of Justice Sutherland's opinions on migratory birds?
      Advertising copy for hair weave commercials?  An article for
      the news system?

           We know what you are.  You're a hack!  Word Star would choke
      on your inept, miserable screed.  What you need is a word processor
      more in keeping with your slender talents, a program that thrives
      on the banal scribblings of mediocre minds.  We at Simplistic
      Software are proud to respond with a word processor just for you.
      WORD BUNGLER!

      Consider these exciting capabilities:

           Better men than you have spent months trying to learn how to
      use those programs we mentioned.  All have a list of commands as
      long as your arm!  If for you, thought is an intolerable labor,
      you'll love WORD BUNGLER.  It has no commands!  That's right,
      folks, no mnemonics to learn, no tricky keystroke sequences to
      memorize!  Just lubricate your typing finger and type, type type!
      We have purposely omitted the ability to make corrections.
      Editing takes time, and to a hack, time is money, right?  Besides,
      a few typos here and there will convince your publisher that you
      really sweat blood over that last article.

           Actually, we fibbed a bit.  WORD BUNGLER has three powerful
      editing commands that will make the competition green with envy.
      Are you stuck on a sentence you just can't seem to get right?  Is
      that last paragraph butchered beyond recognition?  Just hit the
      "TRASH" key, and it will disappear forever!  Of course you also
      lose the rest of what you were working on, but look at it this way.
      If that sentence is so bad you have to TRASH it, the rest of the
      article is bound to be equally putrid.  Better have a couple of
      beers and start over.

           The "REPEAT" command follows an important media principle:  If
      it played in Peoria, play it again, Sam...  and again...  and
      again!  Hit the "REPEAT" key, and those pitifully few good lines
      will be inserted again at a later point in the text, slightly
      modified so as not to be too obvious.  Only a few original ideas
      are vouchsafed to an individual during his lifetime.  We help you
      make the most of your assets!

           Our "EXPAND AND FILL" key is unique in the word processing
      industry.  As you know, plain talk is out of fashion.  Today's
      publisher wants writing that is profound, literate, and urbane!
      Unfortunately, the typical hack's vocabulary just isn't up to the
      task.  Use the "EXPAND AND FILL" key.  WORD BUNGLER will "parse"
      your file, and replace those puny little words with great big ones.
      It will also change active verbs to passive, throw in a couple of
      Latin quotes, and generally muddy up the syntax for an appearance
      of greater depth.  We guarantee a 15 percent increase in the fog
      index for everything you write, or your money back.

           Add ons?  You bet!  We have an extra (high) cost add on for
      everyone.  Here are just a few of the exciting modules you can
      purchase for WORD BUNGLER.

           Sleezymatic - Knowlegeable pornographers will tell you that
      the contents of a successful filthy book are irrelevant.  They're
      all wrapped up in cellophane, so the dirty old men can't paw
      through them.  To sell, your smut has got to have a hot title!
      Sleezymatic generates salacious titles by randomly pairing words
      from two lists containing over 200 words each, ranging from
      suggestive to unprintable.

           Disaster MASTER - A compendium of history's greatest
      disasters, from the destruction of Pompeii to the Mt. St. Helena
      eruption. A must for movie script writers.

           VisiGoth - Gothic romances your specialty?  This nifty module
      will take your romantic hero and heroine, and alter their dialogue
      and dress to fit any historical period or locale.  Write one novel,
      and VisiGoth does the rest.  Specify Robert Redford or Darcy when
      ordering.

           BusiPac - The successful hack dares not neglect business
      details.  BusiPac contains useful submodules specially
      tailored to your needs.  COMPUSCAM is a data base containing a
      choice collection of stock market manipulations, tax evasion
      schemes, confidence games, flim flam techniques, and many other
      ploys of dubious legality.  A special fail safe feature warns you
      when its time to leave town.  DODGEM keeps bill collectors off your
      back by indicating bills you can safely ignore, and generating
      excuses for the more stubborn cases.  The same excuse is never used
      twice for the same creditor.  It also performs the calculations
      necessary for successful check kiting.

I thought this was particularly appropriate for the week when James Michener's
space opera is showing on the tube. For years I've been hearing about how
JM uses a DECmate or whatever to do all his writing. Connoisseurs of Michener,
which is an oxymoron if I ever heard one, claim to be able to tell the
difference between stuff he did on his IBM Selectric and the stuff made out
of 1s and 0s. TV Guide had a delightful article about how laid back Michener
is when it comes to artistic control. You want to change his plot, his focus,
his voice, his characters? The check is already cashed, kids, knock
yourselves out.

Subj:   best nonsense thought of the day...

From an invitation for a seminar on a product called TELL-A-GRAF:

        "Graphics turns data into information..."

                                                &gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJTT

Now, I must confess, I don't get it, because as an old MIS person,
I spent the best part of my working life turning data into information, but
I'm so pleased to hear from &gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJTT again...
