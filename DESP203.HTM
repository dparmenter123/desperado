        The people we hate and contemn really exist.  They aren't just
        cartoon figures or sit-com walk-ons.  They're out there, living
        their lives, affecting others, using up air and water, if not
        Kool-Aid.  I was in the grocery store the other day, standing next
        to a slim young mother with blonde hair pulled back in a bun, jeans
        and a white t-shirt (but upper-crust jeans and t-shirt, if you
        know what I mean).  She had two little girls with her, five and
        seven maybe.  They wanted some Kool-Aid.  Said this modern mom:
        "I'm not here to focus on that.  I don't know why you ask me about
        it at all.  Maybe it's inadequate parenting on my part.  You never
        raise these issues with your father."  I bet the father knows how
        to focus on these parenting issues.

        I figured out how to fly my flag on the Fourth.  I put it up in the
        back yard where only my family and friends could see it.  Is this
        what we've come to?  Private patriotism, so no one will suspect me
        of being a scoundrel?

        Samuel Johnson was wrong:  Patriotism is the first refuge of a
        scoundrel.  Robert Dole is itching to film thirty-second TV spots of
        flag-burning in campaigns against Congressoids who vote in favor of
        freedom of speech.

        Bring on your thirty-second spots Robert Dole!  I could do some
        great ones in response.  How about pictures of folks eating
        mushmouth Tom Carvel's American flag ice cream on American flag
        plates, wiping their mouths with American flag napkins?  Or the
        little girl on the front page of the Boston Herald on the Fourth,
        wearing a dress made of six American flags?  Or the world's
        strongest man from Medford pulling two fire trucks to demonstrate
        his anger at the flag-burning decision, with an American flag
        wrapped around his thick sweaty neck?  Or the flag the size of two
        football fields that Ronald Reagan dedicated a few years ago,
        designed to be displayed lying on the ground!  Lying on the ground!

        And how about the newly fashionable fireproof flags?  The cloth
        they're made out of won't burn, but it won't flap either.  It just
        sort of susurates. They advertise that not only will the flags not
        burn, they'll last longer.  But they won't flap.

        I was thrilled to see the picture of 150 Arkansas state troopers
        surrounding and protecting a black activist who had threatened to
        burn a flag on the steps of the state capitol.  I was also thrilled
        that he didn't burn it.

Subj:   Since you raised the subject of flags again...

I have yet to see any evidence of Iranians burning, or otherwise desecrating
American flags.  Given the powers of observations demonstrated by writers
and editors at least in Nashua, and probably across the country, I don't
wonder that you left their ranks.  I think that before anyone can express an
opinion on the topic of America flags they should be required to pass a test
like the ones you take to get a drivers license:

Answer true or false:

1. The American Flag has a field of blue placed on a set of red and white
   strips with red at the top and white on the bottom.

2. The number of pairs of red and white strips is determined by the size of
   the flag.

3. There are six equal rows of stars arranged on the field of blue.

4. A true patriot displays his flag every day of the year, day and night,
   just as is done over the Capitol building.

5. Burning a designer American Flag shirt in protest is a patriotic act.

6. Wearing an American Flag tatoo is patriotic only if you're a Marine.

mulp knows, as these so-called superpatriots like Senator Robert Dole and
Ronald Reagan (who participated in a ceremony that involved taking a flag
the size of two football fields and laying it on the ground) and President
Bush do not know, the United States has had a law called the U.S. Flag Code
on the books since I don't know when that dictates how to treat the Star
Spangled Banner under all sorts of circumstances.  It's all the law we
need.  It says, among other things, don't put it on the ground,  burn it
when it's worn out, and don't fly it after dark (unless you're the Capitol
Building).

I did see Iranians (in Iran) burning American flags on TV.

I don't think I mentioned, by the way, that the Supreme Court's Pledge of
Allegiance ruling that produced so much putrid posturing in the last
campaign, has quite an inspiring story behind it, one that should make
Americans proud.  The decision was rendered in 1943 in the middle of a
"good" war against an evil (no "quotes") enemy.  It was rendered in a suit
brought by Jehovah's Witnesses, who not only refused to salute the flag, but
also refused to fight, or, in fact, to treat the state like a god in any
way.  Thus, it is to these brave members of a despised sect that we owe
another little bit of freedom of speech.  It is symptomatic of the debased
state of the American press and the Democratic party that this story was
never told during the campaign.  Speaking of Jehovah's witnesses and big
democracies, the Indian Supreme Court has handed down similar rulings in
cases brought by Witnesses.

Subj:   Did I miss something?

I was most distressed to receive Desperado #3032 the other day.  Not because of
the contents, which were up to the usual standard, but because of the number.
The last issue that I received, to the best of my knowlege, was #2031.

Could it be that I failed to notice a full 1000 issues?  And if so, how will I
ever find the time to read all of them?  I'll be flying to the States on
business in a couple of weeks, but even if the Paris air traffic controllers
are on strike still/again, catching up on 1000 back Desperados in-flight
probably would be beyond the capabilities of my poor brain (not to mention my
poor hand luggage).

Or could it be that the editor and/or publisher are trying to slip a fast one
past us?  Or is this a subtle hint (obviously too subtle for me) of some
important event that concerns Desperado?  Or are they just changing the
numbering scheme in an effort confuse the customers, the way that Digital does
with VAXen?

Please announce to the world (or at least to me) the reason for this
portentious change, and relieve us/me of this uncertainty.

Hee-hee-hee-hee-ha-ha-ha!!!  Yes, we did it, we produced 1000 editions in a
matter of days as a bonus for 500 carefully selected Desperadim, who
apparently didn't include you.  There was a nine-part-serial parody of
"Through the Looking Glass" that was also an introduction to Unix, 47
stories of dogs who followed their masters across one or more states to be
reunited, another 112 stories of other amazing animal pathfinders, 452
things originally sent out by Nina Eppes and then weakly rebroadcast by me
without the tell-tale address trails, a hilarious discussion of porcelain
pottery technology, terminal-art renditions of every animated character from
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", including a naked Jessica and a naked Betty
Boop, "Boys and Toys" (the scathing expose of the MIT media lab), the COBOL
Chronicles (99 hacks, a 'C' compiler and an operating system, all written in
COBOL), true tales of the masters of technical documentation from Aristotle
to Cyrano de Bergerac to Franz Kafka to Norman Mailer, 3020 assorted bumper
stickers, that most distressing Sherlock Holmes rathole that cost us 20 of
the 500 superprivileged subscribers, 40 additions to the anarchist's
cookbook of infernal machines (particularly the brilliant Bic-in-the-
cylinder maneuver that turned out to be a fantasy/hoax), 101 dirty songs
that made the hit parade explained, no Dave Barry columns, 48 amusing
company names, two proposed Constitutional amendments that electrified
democracies around the world, a guest appearance by Dan Quayle in which he
revealed himself as a droll political satirist, a solution of the four-color
problem in four lines of Lisp (that drew a response solving the
job-shop-scheduling problem in 48 pages of COBOL), John Covert learns to
count, the return of Kohutek (this time in a blaze of glory), an exclusive
conversation (getting hot at times) between Marvin Minsky and Edsgar
Dijkstra, Australian euphemisms (including all the words to "Chunder in the
Blue Pacific Sea"), one reader talked out of suicide, another talked into
surrendering herself to the authorities, the story about the deepest water
well in the west, the little random-number generator that could, that
incredibly boring discussion of "der goldene Schnitt" that the readers
insisted on continuing despite my rude dismissals, how flocking could be
implemented for controlling large VAX clusters, 200 toasts, 64 boasts,
imaginary bird names, how I shipped out  as third mate on a Baltic steamer
just so I could legitimately wear one of the caps, curmudgeons cool and hot,
and four separate explanations of the quiddities of the Desperado numbering
algorithm.  You missed all that, and much much much more and you'll *never*
be allowed to see *any* of it.  What *fun* we all had, we happy few!  But,
like an Esther Williams movie, that's all water over the dame, so back to
today's boring issue, number 3033 in a long, long (indeterminately long)
series.

Subj:   re Desperado #3032 (large rodents)

  The piece about the Gopher-It device which repels rodents up to 100
  feet in diameter was timely for me. Just a few days ago, we took our
  kids to the Southwick Animal Farm in Millville, Mass, which features,
  in addition to the more conventional livestock (lions, rhinos,
  giraffes, monkeys, etc.), the capybara. Now I was fortunate (?) to
  know something about capybaras, since my little brother was always
  interested in the unfamiliar objects of the world, including TVR
  automobiles, keeshunds, and capybaras. He often got his way with our
  parents, but as much as he pleaded and pleaded and whined and
  groveled, they never gave in to his request to have one of these as a
  pet.

  The capybara is the world's largest rodent, and looks a lot like a
  very large guinea pig, only less cuddly (they're the size of a medium-
  large dog). The sign on their cage informed us that they can reach a
  weight of 150 pounds, and these specimens looked particularly well
  fed. My wife, who's not at all fond of rodents, moved quickly to the
  next exhibit. I'm not much bothered by rodents, but a more hideous
  creature would be hard to imagine. I suppose they would be more than a
  meal for a large cat.

  In any case, interested readers can view them at the Southwick Animal
  Farm, which is, in all other respects, a delightful place and highly
  recommended.

Subj:   RE: "Wedding Story" in Desperado #3032

Hey, buddy, just for the record, that was copyrighted material.  That's right,
it wasn't written by Jerry Eckert, but by Robert Fulghum, the gentleperson who
also wrote the widely pirated "Everything I Need To Know I Learned In Kinder-
garten".  I forget in which of his two books its published, but he has the
right to restrict distribution.  Hope he doesn't get upset.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Hey, I hope he does get upset.  We could use some more famous writers in
here.  My heart goes out, though, to anyone who's read two whole books of
Fulghum.

He's already the most plagiarized writer since Max Ehrmann (quiz time:
What did Max write?), but they all plagiarize the same thing (just like
they did with Max).  If Fulghum started today chasing all the people who've
ripped off the "kindergarten" bit, he'll never get around to me.  Besides,
the *first* thing he learned in kindergarten was "Share everything."

"It was on fire":  This is the joke about the man charged with being drunk
and setting his bed on fire.  "I admit to being drunk, your honor, but not
the other.  The bed was already on fire when I got into it."

Interestingly, the "kindergarten" bit does not appear in Fulghum's book of
that title.  It's on the dust jacket only.  Hmm.  I wonder if his publisher
is plagiarizing him too.

Subj:   Desperado #3032: FORTRAN

The version of the original WWV message that I saw a couple of weeks ago had
sequence numbers in columns 72 through 80.  Apparently, even more of a mystery
than how those numbers got there is how they got removed by the time you saw
the message.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Ah, the mysterious insertion and removal of "data", always a difficulty.
Yes, why would somebody take out the sequence numbers (a specialite de
FORTRAN) and then forward it on to where I ended up with it?  Maybe the
message passed through a FORTRAN compiler somewhere along the way?

Subj:   possible Desperado item?

The following anecdote about Charles Babbage is quoted from the 28 May 1990 NY
Times Book Review, which in turn was quoting "A Literary Companion to
Science," edited by Walter Gratzer (Norton).

Babbage was at the center of a social set that contained many of the prominent
figures in the arts and sciences of the day. Darwin and Dickens might come to
dinner on a Saturday night. So might Thackeray, Herschel, and Longfellow. After
he read a poem by Tennyson, which contains the line "Every minute dies a man/
Every minute one is born," Babbage wrote to the poet, an occasional guest at
his famous dinner parties, and suggested a few changes.

"I need hardly to tell you that this calculation would tend to keep the sum
total of the world's population in a state of perpetual equipoise, whereas it
is a well-known fact that the said sum total is constantly on the increase. I
would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in the next edition of your
excellent poem the erroneous calculation to which I refer should be corrected
as follows: 'Every moment dies a man, /And one and a sixteenth is born.' I may
add that the exact figures are 1.167, but something must, of course, be
conceded to the laws of metre."

A flood of replies greeted Jason Edward Floyd's [jfloyd@cscwam.umd.edu]
reasonable question in Space Digest:

&gt;    I have heard that it is possible to name a star or galaxy. Is this
&gt;true? If so how does one go about doing it?

In a very informative followup, Michael P. Collin  [mikec@phx.mcd.mot.com]
explained:

&gt;  There is at least one organization, the International Star Registry, which
&gt;will, for a fee, provide anyone with a very authentic looking certificate
&gt;assigning your name to a designated star... If you question them carefully, or
&gt;check the small print in their agreement, you'll learn that their registry of
&gt;star names is not referenced by anyone in the world's astronomical community.
&gt;In other words, for their price, you get a fancy piece of paper.  Nothing more.

This reminded me of a scheme I've been brooding over for some time.  The flaw
in the ISR scam is that the stars involved *already have names*, and have been
the objects of study by astronomers for many years.  Hence nobody will pay any
attention to the names ISR gives to stars.

Now, here at Fermilab, we have a facility which can manufacture elementary
particles and point them in certain directions.

In particular, we have one of the few neutrino-production facilities in the
world.  We could offer to produce a NEW neutrino, one WHICH HAS NEVER EXISTED
BEFORE, give it a name you suggest, and CATAPULT IT OFF INTO THE DISTANT
COSMOS at the SPEED OF LIGHT!  This is an object that HAS NEVER BEFORE HAD A
NAME! All for a modest fee.

Think of it. Your neutrino, a living remembrance of you or your sweetie,
speeding through the void indefinitely.  Stars BURN OUT and DIE... but your
neutrino is GUARANTEED TO LAST AS LONG AS THE UNIVERSE-- or your money back!
[See Technical Note below.]

Along with the certificate proving that your neutrino has been manufactured,
named, and launched, we can tell you its destination: coordinates on the sky,
and perhaps the nearest known object to that location. We need a program that
figures out the right ascension and declination of the Neutrino beam line as
the Earth turns (if anybody cares, it's 22 degrees east of North, at Batavia,
Illinois, 41 51 13 N, 88 18 41 W, and tangent to the ground, 745 feet above sea
level).  Couple this with a database of astronomical catalogue objects, and the
program can print out a message like:

  Your neutrino, NAME_HERE, will pass within DISTANCE light-years of
  the GALAXY_OR_QUASAR known as OBSCURE_CATALOGUE_DESIGNATION in the year
  DISTANT_FUTURE_YEAR.

I think this idea is much neater than getting a crummy old star named after
you.  Definitely worth millions.

The catch is that all the necessary equipment belongs to the U.S. federal
government.  I've never asked them whether my Intergalactic Neutrino Registry
business could use it, or what it would cost.  I fear they'd put too much red
tape in my way. It might be a good way for the Department of Energy to raise
supplemental funding, too.  After all, they rent out Fermilab's cornfields to
farmers.  But are they farsighted enough to see the brilliance of my proposal?

[Technical Note: There is a finite chance the neutrino will get absorbed by
intergalactic matter, but it's rather small, and our business can well afford
paying such refunds.  If the universe is closed, all our neutrinos will be
absorbed just a few minutes (how long?? good physics exam exercise) before the
Big Crunch. But I'm willing to bet that most customers won't bother to collect
on our claim in the final minutes of the universe-- they'll probably be busy
with other matters.  If the universe is open or flat, we have no worries.

One other danger: It's conceivable that neutrinos might someday be discovered
to decay or oscillate into some other kind of particle.  But in the fine print,
we can put language that'll void the gurantee if that happens.]

        WBCN radio in Boston recently introduced its audience to an expression
which is apparently commonly used in the South (probably Texas they said). The
expression is, "dickin' the dog." If one is not particularly busy, then one
might say, "I'm just dickin' the dog."
        I was just wondering how this expression might have sprung into
existence...I picture a lonely cowboy...a VERY lonely cowboy...who uses the
term "dog" to refer to a part of his anatomy or else has a certain attraction
to the four-legged variety.
        At least it should be safe to say that there won't be many people at
DEC "dickin' the dog" for a while...

There was an item in Desperado about how there is no zoo in zoology
and lingerie isn't derived from any French word -- I think this was
from some reference book.  I don't know about zoology (except that
I think zoo is short for zoological), but lingerie *is* a French word.
It's derived from another French word, le linge, which means linen.

attitudes, meticulously clean, neat and orderly, dresses appropriately

and likes women, who is expert in the art of courtship, likes pets,
nature, an appreciation for the finer things in life, prefers quality
to quantity, always puts toilet seat down, and believes in a supreme

For the multitudinous desperadi?

There must be something in this akin to the engineers stop after three
decimal places joke.

Subject: a parable about generality in architecture
Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his
advisors for a test.  He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots
in the top, a control knob, and a lever.  "What do you think this is?"

One advisor, an engineer, answered first. "It is a toaster," he said.  The
king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?" The engineer
replied, "Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program
that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades
of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that
darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values.
Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the
initial value selected from the table.  At the end of the time delay, it
would turn off the heat and pop up the toast.  Come back next week, and I'll
show you a working prototype."

The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger
of such short-sighted thinking.  He said, "Toasters don't just turn bread
into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles.  What you see before
you is really a breakfast food cooker.  As the subjects of your kingdom
become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities.  They will
need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make
scrambled eggs.  A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete.  If
we don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster
in just a few years."

"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the
problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class
into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry.  The specialization process
should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and
waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided
into scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various
omelet classes."

"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must
inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes.  Thus, we
see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance.
At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to
the object that says, 'Cook yourself.'  The semantics of this message
depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning
to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs."

"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has revealed
that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food.  In the
design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements.  Specifically,
we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance.  Of course,
users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so
concurrent processing is required, too."

"We must not forget the user interface.  The lever that lowers the food
lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing.  Users won't buy the
product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface.  When the
breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the
screen.  Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v. 8.3' appears on
the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the
market.)  Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to
cook."

"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the
design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for
the implementation phase.  An Intel 80386 with 8MB of memory, a 30MB hard
disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient.  If you select a multitasking,
object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a
built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap.  (Imagine the difficulty
we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design
strategy to lock us into a four-bit microcontroller!)."

The king had the computer scientist thrown in the moat, and they all lived
happily ever after.

Reports continue to surface of hastily formed detoxification and

Rumors in corporate suites describe wild and bizarre executive behavior.
The rehabilitation programs allegedly treat the highest echelons of American
business and military organizations.

Sources report executives huddled together in darkened penthouses smoking
crushed Maalox tablets, chewing wads of Post-It notes, painting themselves
with highlighters while dancing around bonfires of old Annual Reports, and
using their Cross pen sets to inject ball-point ink.

Military officers are reportedly hardest hit as they have no enemy left.

"It starts out innocently, just a bunch of brass bitching about the collapse
of the Commies and longing for the good old days of cost overruns and cushy
post-retirement consulting jobs.  But then somebody starts handing out the
Liquid Paper, and, oh God, at first it's fun but pretty soon you're just
chasing that first high," said one ex-Fortune 500 Senior VP. "It's a
pathetic sight, really.  Especially when somebody brings in a new box of
antacid tablets.  On a bad night, people get hurt fighting over them."

Industry groups continue to deny the existence of the scourge.

"OK, so maybe a few distressed investment bankers get out of hand once and a
while, or some S&amp;L executives.  I categorically deny this problem is
widespread or injurious to American industry," said an extremely wide-eyed,
jumpy, sweating industry spokesperson before inhaling from a fountain pen
and running from the press conference while babbling incoherently.

The manufacturers of Liquid Paper and Maalox refused to comment on reports
that unusually large amounts of their products are selling near large
corporate offices and business schools.

How did we go from mnemonics to haiku anyway?  I once defined mnemonic (in
an official Digital publication) as "a hard-to-remember word meaning easy to
remember".  And a haiku, of course, is an unrhymed poem of 17 syllables,
usually in the order 5, 7, and 5 and often on the subject of the seasons.

Following are some haiku, appropriate to this season, translated from
Japanese by R.H. Blyth (further citation on request) that do not, of
course, obey the syllabic rules now that they have been translated.

FIREWORKS

En hana ya  nimon hanabi mo  yoru no tei

           On the edge of the verandah,
        A pennorth of fireworks also,
           Gives the feeling of night,

Hito kaeru  hanabi no ato no  kurabi kana

           The fireworks over,
        The people all gone,--
           How dark it is!

Hanabibune  yujin satte   aki no mizu

           In a boat seeing the fireworks;
        When the spectators had gone,--
           The water of autumn.

The explanation:  "To see the darkness of the water, the fireworks were
necessary.  To see the meaning of the water of autumn, its loneliness and
inevitability, its silence, the sightseers were necessary.   Water has all
the seasons in it; and in solitude when all have departed we see it under
the aspect of autumn."  Get it?

Subj:   An interesting analogy...

    Electrical Engineering is a relatively new profession, but it bears
    many similarities to the world's oldest profession. It is predominated
    by a single sex (albeit a different one); most of the income goes to
    the management; success is measured by how soon one gets out of the
    profession; and beyond a certain point, age and experience are
    negatives.

Ah, yes, and as Moliere said:  "Writing is like prostitution.  First you do
it for love, then you do it for your friends, and finally you do it for
money."

All professions follow the model of the oldest one, including the basis
in specialized skill and knowledge and a willingness to undertake work
that others might find distasteful or otherwise outside their interests.

Beginner`s Guide":

"Commands are terse to save keystrokes.  They are usually descriptive
of the simple functions they perform.  Unless you are already familiar
with those sorts of functions, the names may seem cryptic.  The more
you learn, the more sensible things will begin to seem.  So, rather
than being put off by it, get familiar with the jargon!  You'll learn
a lot more about computers than just how to use one."

Subj:   Perkin Elmer Software stories

        Once upon a time, between times working for Digital, I worked
        for Perkin Elmer (Perky Erky as we fun-loving computer types
        called it). I worked in what was then the Data Systems division
        but is now a separate company. We always admired to optical
        division because people actually wanted to buy their stuff.

        The story about the software glitch that may have been involved
        in the Hubble screw up reminded me of the painful days I spent
        with Perky Erky software. My favorite story, supposedly true,
        told to me by someone who claims to have been there, involves
        a customer presentation.

        The presentation was in two parts: hardware and software. Every
        so often a question was asked during the hardware section that
        was postponed to be covered as part of the software presentation.
        At the end of the hardware talk one of the prospective customers
        stood up and announced that the hardware was so impressive that
        he didn't understand why everyone didn't buy Perkin Elmer computers.

        The software presenter calmly replied that they answered that
        when they covered software.

        PS: When is Desperado going to be available in Bookreader format?
        Or at least PostScript if you're going to suggest printing it 2 up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
As far as I'm concerned, ASCII is the only successful software standard ever
and I'll stick with it until something equally good comes along.  We do go
everywhere.  Some people print us out on line printers!  (Alfred is too
polite to mention that I'm responsible for the software I'd have to use to
put Desperado out in Bookreader and/or PostScript form.)

re: bumper stickers:

I'm a member of the world's largest running club, the Hash House Harriers,
variously described as "a drinking club with a running problem" and "the
Hells Angels of jogging."  We set "hare and hounds" runs throughout the
streets and woods.  When the hounds are on the trail, they yell "On On"
to each other.

I have two bumper stickers on my car: on the left is "ON ON," on the right
is the same sign upside down.

Someday, however, I'll find a bumper sticker manufacturer and have a custom
set made up, with "flaunt" on the left and "flout" on the right.

&gt;Conversation between two youngish women standing ahead of me in a

&gt;
&gt;        "Well, I've worked for several bosses so far, and most have been
&gt;        okay...  but THIS one -- wow, *THIS* one's a wicked turdmonger!"

  Hmm... in about 1978, I was in a crew building a log home.  The owner
  liked to refer to less-than-competent contractors as "turd-hookers".
  That's been one of my favorite substitutes for more colorful adjectives
  ever since.  Maybe Fred's still out there making his contributions.
