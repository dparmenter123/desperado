Every couple of years, the Nashua Choral Society takes it on the road.
This year, sixty singers and a busload of roadies took it to Belgium,
France, and several parts of the United Kingdom. In the great tradition
of DESPERADO as the hacker's replacement for HOLIDAY magazine, I am not only
going to share it with you, I am going to urge you to share your vacation
stories with me and the rest of us. It's the next best thing to being there,
as they used to say before they told you to reach out and touch someone.

Sabena Airlines washed us up on Brussels' doorstep early one Saturday morning,
where a Belgian tour guide met us at the airport (along with the couriers
provided by the musical agency that had arranged our concerts). She cheerily
welcomed us to sunny Belgium (my first act was the purchase of a folding
umbrella that wasn't dry once in Belgium) and took us off on a tour of
Brussels.

Brussels' heyday was about twenty years ago, evidently, and the capital
is up to the minute for noon, 1964. The European character of the city
is heavily disguised by a sort of American rind, which our tour guide
was very proud of and showed us thoroughly. But there are beautiful parts
of the city, and jet-logged and sleepy as we were, nobody was going to sit
still without searching them out. The Grand Place or Grote Markt is the
showplace of Brussels -- it's the old city market square, entirely surrounded
and defined by 15th century domestic Gothic guildhalls, and on this bright and
showery day, fluttering with the banners of the guilds which used to operate
out of them. Talk about corporate headquarters!

Summer is not the best time to travel because everybody else thinks it is
the best time to travel, and wherever you are, there's everybody else.
We were by no means the only visitors to Brussels, but
wherever we went on our lightning tour (we were there for a day
before travelling on to Antwerp), there were other Nashua Choristers,
buying Godiva ice cream cones, buying Belgian lace (lovely stuff),
having drinks in the cafes, getting rained on, walking back from the
Grand'Place to our colorful hotel...on the edges of the redlight district
in Brussels, and (as we thought in our naivete) fairly grim, although
spotless, if shabby.

Antwerp, on the other hand, confined its building to refineries and chemical
plants, pretty much leaving the old city as it was. Wally and I, with
uncritical enthusiam for river cruises as a way of seeing cities, signed
on for the Antwerpian version, and became very familiar with these refineries
and their capacity and the number of Belgians they employ. Antwerp has shopping
districts and the equivalent of downtown, of course, but they can be
avoided very easily. However, we discovered just what "grim" means when
applied to a hotel. It means staying at the International Seaman's House,
which, while clean and moderately spacious, has interesting ideas about
sanitary arrangements for women, and a clientele that would make your hair
curl. Coed bathrooms are all very well, if the indigenous
population doesn't feel that this licenses them to be obnoxious, but one woman
looked up from her shower and found a dude, who obviously made no other use of
the shower, looking at her over the top of the partition. After that, the use
of the facilities was strictly on the buddy system: one woman with a towel,
and one with a baseball bat. On the other hand, we didn't have to leave the
hotel to pick up sailors.

We planned to give a concert in Antwerp along with the Alma Choir, a
small local choral group. They invited us to "a typical Flemish
meal" one evening, and since all we knew of Flemish food was what the
guidebooks said ("Leans heavily on cream and butter; very rich and plentiful"),
most of us were careful about what we ate that day. We arrived hungry,
to be greeted by the choir singing beautiful welcome songs in
Flemish, and went into the large hall where we would be singing the following
day. There were long tables with plates of bread and small platters of
cold cuts. We watched our hosts to see what to do next, and when they made
themselves little sandwiches, we thought to ourselves "Aha! Hors d'oeuvres!"
We helped ourselves lightly, still expecting a rich and plentiful typical
Flemish meal, and only gradually did it dawn on us as our hosts continued to
make themselves little sandwiches and looked at us squiggle-eyed for not eating
more, that this was NOT hors d'oeuvres, but by then it was too late, because
it was all gone!

This may explain why people went bonzo over beautiful Belgian
chocolates. The Belgians go in for baroque sweets. My dear husband and I
were startled to see a Parma ham in the window of a candy shop, until we
realized it was marzipan!

The cathedral of Antwerp is a handsome structure, plopped down in the middle
of the old section of the city, and surrounded by lace shops, chocolatiers,
and umbrella stores, thus filling every conceivable need the tourist might
have. There are also enjoyable restaurants on the cathedral square.

The exterior of the cathedral was tastefully draped in scaffolding. Restoration
has been going on for nearly a decade. A fellow-traveller who had visited
Antwerp ten years ago commented on the impressive progress that has been
made. Last time he was there, he picked his way through the nave on planks
laid across the open (unoccupied) graves revealed when the floor was taken
up.

Peter Paul Rubens, part-time diplomat and hometown boy, is the town hero,
and why not. The cathedral is rich with his paintings, and other splendid
Flemish works, including a beautiful 15th century alabaster Virgin and Child,
with a very sweet and very silly smile on her face. This smile shows up on
the  Gothic sculptures  on the outside of Strasbourg Cathedral, and far
be it from me to complain, but these ladies SIMPER. Rubens contributed
a handsome altarpiece of the presentation of the Virgin that
lights up the entire interior. This interior was painted white by the
seventeenth-century Iconoclasts, covering over the frescoes that had
decorated the walls. Our contemporary taste approves this move, but it was an
act of vandalism in the name of faith, none the less.

We made a side trip to the medieval town of Bruges, which has been carefully
preserved, rather in the manner of Williamsburg, and which in consequence
attracts lots of tourists. The medieval districts are insulated
from the streets full of shops, banks and offices that belong to modern
Bruges. You can walk from one part of the historical district to another
and only hit glancingly the modern city.

Bruges used to be a port, and although it's now landlocked, the old harbor
has been preserved as a lake in a green park. It's called the Minnewater.
I was delighted, when visiting the Groeninge Museum in Bruges, to recognize
it in the landscapes in the background of sacred paintings. In fact, the
Groeninge rather features paintings with Bruges in the background. When I
was a callow art history graduate student, I hoped to write my doctoral thesis
on "Distant Landscape in Flemish Painting of the Sixteenth Century", and now
I plan to work it into the next release of ACMS documentation.

We left Antwerp at six o'clock one morning, watched by the unsmiling eyes
of the international seamen, and bashed off south to our next stop, the
Alsatian city of Strasbourg. I had never travelled in northern Europe
before, and I was entranced by the variety of the landscape. We rode our
coach through the Ardennes in southern Belgium, listening to our local
authority make up all kinds of fascinating details about Belgium's role in
the two World Wars. This is a gentleman who is NEVER at a loss for an
authoritative pronouncement. It's quite like talking to me...We were in and
out of Luxembourg so fast that quite a few people slept through it.

Then we were in France, with no formalities of any kind, disappointing
the visa collectors among us. The weather looked up sharply when we got
into France, too. It had ranged from the constant, soft drizzle of
Antwerp to the pelting downpour of Bruges. One result of all this sozzle
is that Bruges, especially, is lushly green and rioting with flowers.
But as we tore through the plain of Alsace, seeing tiny red-roofed villages
tucked into the folds of the plain and watching hawks laze through the
updrafts, the sun shone more and more brightly, so that our first view of
Strasbourg had light and shadow to enliven it.

Not that Strasbourg needs sunshine to be one of the most beautiful places
I've ever seen. It has taken its place in my personal urban pantheon, next
to Charleston, South Carolina, and Bath, England. It's been shuttled back and
forth between France and Germany for centuries, and partakes of the best of
the character of both nations. It is said to have the best food in Europe,
and my dear husband was in seventh heaven at the Choucroute (subtle and
delicate sauerkraut with various sorts of sausages). The Alsatians
specialize in half-timbered architecture, which they decorate very richly
with paint and patterns. The indigenous stone is a rosy sandstone, and many
of the houses are painted a soft salmon pink that is a very welcoming and
cheery color to see in your streets! The very cathedral (in restoration,
as were almost all the cathedrals we saw, and good for them, I say) is a
dark, dusty salmon outside. Inside, it is unusually dark and mysterious and
smoky.

Strasbourg is threaded with canals, which are in turn lined with flowers
and parks. You can take a cruise of the canals, which we did. No refineries
here! The canal boats leave from a picturesque and charming section of
Strasbourg called "Petit France", because it's where the French people
who lived in Strasbourg first settled. (It's a little confusing at times,
but there are museums to straighten it all out for you.) They
were mostly tanners, and the roofs of houses are very steep, and have
covered racks for drying hides. Now my grandfather was a tanner, and I
can imagine the smell...to my relief, nobody tans there anymore.

I got the chance to try out my very rusty but exquisitely pronounced
high school French. I can read a menu in French, and get my laundry done,
and buy a basket and mail a half-kilo of chocolates to my sister
in Atlanta. (Leonidas makes Godiva look sick, and for half the price. I
tasted one, and they are heavenly.) But dear Wally was up the riviere
without a pirogue, because he speaks no French whatsoever and I couldn't
always be with him because of rehearsals and concerts and such. We finally
tracked down a phrase book with such useful items as "Je suis desole, monsieur"
which means "I'm terribly sorry, officer". The problem, of course, with being
able to pronounce better than you can speak, is that people think you can
understand better than you can speak, and rattle at you at tremendous speed.

All too soon, our short sojourn in Strasbourg came to an end. And
as our bus sank slowly in the west, we bid a reluctant farewell to the Hotel
Pax -- remember that name if you have any plans to go there. A pleasant,
family hotel, on a quiet street near the railway station, with small but
cheerful rooms and private baths with showers. After the exigencies of Antwerp,
we thought we had died and gone to Heaven.

We flew to England from Holland (with a ten-hour bus ride from Strasbourg
throw in). We made a tearing visit to Winchester, which is a charming small
city which has balanced growth and preservation very well. We were there with
time for a rehearsal and a concert, and the fulfilment of two long-cherished
wishes: I got to go to divine service in an English cathedral, and dear
Wally got to go to a cricket match. Divine service had a bishop in full
fig, AND the spectacular Winchester Cathedral Choir, which you may have
heard performing the Andrew Lloyd Webber Requiem, and better than he
deserves, I may say...It was all very mysterious to a simple New England
Congregationalist, but very beautiful.

Cricket, on the other hand, is very mysterious but not terribly beautiful.
It does have the advantage that it usually winds up being replayed in
some small and friendly pub, to the accompaniment of pint upon pint of
splendid English beer. We had the great advantage, in Winchester, of
"home stays": the host musical organization puts the visiting musical
organization up in their homes, and very delightful it is! We stayed with
a great gardener and her husband, the cricket player who showed Wally
the ins and outs of the game and the beer drinking.

Our next stop was Port Talbot, Wales, and since it was relatively near,
we made a leisurely day of our trip West, stopping first in Salisbury,
to visit the Cathedral, with its renowned ecclesiastical needlework.
You cannot imagine the glittering richness you can achieve with wool
and canvas in the service of your church. Salisbury is the
cathedral that Constable loved to paint, and many of the views which
he did paint have been preserved. Partly, of course, because you can't
build very successfully on a water meadow. Our day in London was spent
at the Victoria and Albert Museum, looking at Constables.

We also stopped in Bath, where Wally and I spent close to a week a few
years back because we couldn't tear ourselves away!

The engineering high point of our trip came when we entered Wales by way of
the Severn Bridge. No, I tell a lie, the engineering high point came when
I was taking my ease in the close of Chester Cathedral, which is overlooked
by the City walls, which are still intact and a delightful place to walk.
A tour guide was leading a leisurely walk and telling tales of Chester, and
he pointed out that when Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed the Great Eastern,
an immense steamship of the Victorian age, he used the distance between two
great gates in the city walls of Chester to help people understand just how
large it was. Isambard Kingdom Brunel has always been a heartthrob of mine.
For many years, I traveled with a folding morocco traveling photograph
frame that contained a picture postcard of him that I got at the National
Portrait Gallery.

At first sight, Port Talbot, West Glamorganshire, South Wales, is rather
daunting. Street upon street of rows of mud-colored stucco houses, dominated
by immense steel mills on one side, and steep, featureless green hills on
the other. The only romantic Welsh castle in sight proved to have been
constructed out of whole cloth by a Victorian architect who admired the
Gothick style. But as soon as we pulled up to the seafront hotel, built
about 1960 and showing its age, and scores of cheerful Welsh singers
poured out of the ballroom and started claiming their guests (another home
stay, here), things started to look up. In the ballroom was spread a lavish
tea, with these exquisite little objects called "Welsh cakes" and cups of
strong sweet milky tea and SPEECHES! Every officer of the Port Talbot
Cymric Male Choir made a speech, and to do them justice, they spoke very
well. As you might imagine, Welsh speech is very musical: soft, lilting,
and so varied and expressive you wonder what they make of flat, monotone
American speech. And they do love the sound of it; we had speeches on
every possible occasion, including the one time in my experience of
the Nashua Choral Society that our conductor consented to an encore.
He left the stage very briefly, to thunderous applause and a standing
ovation, intending to return after the merest show of modest reluctance.
But an officer of the Welsh choir nipped onto the podium before he
could return and instead of lovable us belting out the Hallelujah Chorus,
our audience was treated to another blasted speech!

The South Welsh love to sing, make speeches, and party. Every night that
we stayed in Port Talbot there was another party, sometimes two a day.
Everybody would crowd into, say, the local Rugby club, and knock back
pint upon pint, and sing. Broadway tunes, Elvis Presley, 1940's love songs,
Welsh hymns, Welsh folk songs--but never Men of Harlech and never the
Ash Grove. The Welsh sing the way most people breathe:
constantly, naturally, and beautifully. (I don't know if anyone has
complimented you on your breathing lately, but take my word for it,
you're a terrific bunch of breathers.) And every evening ended with the singing
of the American national anthem and the Welsh national anthem.

Curiously, Welsh women don't seem to sing. The Cymric Choir was all
men, and our hosts kept assuming that Wally was the singer in our family.
My announcement that it was I who sang, and sang soprano at that, was
usually greeted with polite scorn. Human beings don't sing those notes,
and women don't sing at all, except in church, and was I sure Wally
didn't sing? Admittedly, under the influence of Double Diamond and the
cover of night, he did do a little singing at the party after our
performance, but it took a lot of Double Diamond and the urging of
our host to bring him to it.

I do not mean to imply that Port Talbot is utterly without attraction except
for the charm of its people and its rugby clubs. There is a delightful
spot nearby called Margan Abbey and Margan Country Park. The Abbey has
a beautiful old ruin of a parish church perched on the top of a nearby
hill. This church, which was a stiff climb of about twenty minutes at
top speed for dear Wally, was the parish church of the lay brothers
attached to the Cistercian monastery at Margan Abbey. From this vantage
point, one can see in the fields far below (far too below for my acrophobic
taste) a stone circle. Now Wally was very impressed with this, until he
learned from our host that when the Eisteddfod comes to your town, which is
an honor, if your town doesn't have a stone circle, the Eisteddfod folks will
truck one in. Mind you, you get to keep it.

At this point we left the Nashua Choral Society tour to pursue interests of
our own in the West of England. They went to London for a few days and
came back to Nashua, in, I understand, good order. We rented a car and
took off to see if we could find a Welsh castle that wasn't Victorian.

Wally found Dinas Bran, built in the tenth century and already a
notable ruin in the sixteenth century. Dinas Bran perches on the pinnacle
of a very steep Welsh crag above the beautiful town of Llangollen (pronounced
Chlangochlan. This disparity between sound and spelling is typical of
the non-Anglo-Saxon races of Britain, like Celts and Britons and Angles,
and we think it's to keep the Sassenachs guessing.)

Two days of driving North through Wales were punctuated with constant
cries of "Mind your left!" from the passenger. Wales is astonishingly
beautiful and varied. We drove from the industrial south coast to the desolate
grassy mountains of the Brecon Beacons, covered with sheep that in the
hazy heat were sleeping in the shadow of enormous rocks and looking
perfectly demented.

We wanted to see Chester, a city on the West Coast of England north of
Wales that has Roman remains, beautiful indigenous architecture, and
city walls, mentioned above, that are virtually complete. You can walk
round the walls for a distance of two miles, visiting the handsome city
gates and looking into people's gardens and observing the Roman remains.
In fact, the Chester Tourist Board offers a tour of the city in the
company of a uniformed Roman legionary, in complete and resplendent
Roman armor. While the tour is not given in Latin, it refers only to Roman
Chester, and it's a hoot!

We had to go through London to pick up a plane to the South of France to
visit friends, and while there (for all of twenty-four hours) we fulfilled
the promise of Salisbury and went to the Victoria and Albert Museum to
see the Constables. The V&amp;A is a splendid museum,with spectacular collections
of artisanry from many countries, times, and cultures, We paid homage
to the Constables, and on our way out, saw a gentleman waiting for the lift.
He was wearing a velvet jacket, baggy tartan trousers, a soft mushy silk tie,
pince-nez, yellow shoes, and was making notes in a minute morocco-covered
notebook with an ivory pencil. I'm still not sure he wasn't the ghost of
Lytton Strachey or Robert Byron.

Are you still with me? I assure you, we were fading ourselves by this
point in our trip, which then shifted venue to the South of France, where
we visited friends who work at Valbonne and live in Antibes. Valbonne is
the prettiest French village imaginable, I thought, at least the part of
it that we drove through on our way to the Fondation Maeght museum. It
is houses of honey-colored stone tumbled together, punctuated with flowers,
set in the midst of green and precipitous mountains. Denizens may have other
ideas, but I liked it.

The climax of the entire trip was dinner at the Chantecler Restaurant
at the Hotel Negresco in Nice. Our host suggested this a full month
before we left the US, because he had to make reservations that far in
advance. The French restaurant guide that he consulted awarded the
Chantecler four chef's toques, analogous to the Guide Michelin's stars.
The meal was astonishing, a carefully orchestrated symphony of tastes,
textures, colors, and sauces. The sauces, by the way, were nouvelle
cuisine: very little butter and cream, but richly reduced essences of
the appropriate stock. Just to give you an idea: I started with
the silkiest duck pate, garnished with slices of roast duck breast
and smoked duck breast. The next course was stuffed zucchini flowers,
garnished with slices of black truffles. You can have no idea how decadent
it feels to eat flowers, especially when they are as delicious as these!
Then I had langouste, the spiny rock lobster of Europe, and then I had
a dream of lamb, and THEN the fixed dinner that I chose gave me three
desserts, each more extravagant and frivolous than the last. No flowers
though.

Little else remains to be told. We spent three delightful days relaxing
on our friends' porch, shaded with grape leaves, recovering from the
exertions of the previous three weeks. Except for the fact that I
need a vacation to recover, it was quite a trip!

By the way, I do not mention rehearsals and concerts and such in this
narrative, because I am preparing a detailed and technical discussion of
our musical experiences for separate publication. If you'd like a copy, and
you aren't on the musical distribution lists of Jo Warburton-Russel and
Nina Eppes, just tear off the top of this Desperado and send it to
BOOKIE::NEILSEN. Please be sure to specify the Musical Travelogue,
since I will offer this copy of Desperado to my musical audience, too.
I will send you one as soon as it's ready, which may be a while.
