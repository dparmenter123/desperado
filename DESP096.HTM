        BAD NEWS:  I've seen a bunch of Massachusetts drivers with
a new breed of customized commercial plates on the fronts of their
cars.  (You know, the kind that are actually just metal bumper-
stickers.  The ones that say "Fishermen Have Longer Rods" and other
such meaningful information.)  This new breed of plates are written
in green letters on a white background, in the block-letter style of
real license plates.  They usually have a one-word main thought on
them; with supporting phrases in smaller print right where we New
Hampsterers put "LIVE FREE OR DIE!!!".  For example,

<center><table border=1><tr>
<td align=center><tt><font size=+2>&nbsp;H&nbsp;O&nbsp;C&nbsp;K&nbsp;E&nbsp;Y&nbsp;</font><br>&nbsp;IS MY SPORT&nbsp;</tt>
</table></center>

(If you didn't see that example properly, you either don't have a VT100
or you aren't using the EXTRACT TT: command to see it!)
        These things are murder for us vanity plate watchers!

        GOOD NEWS:  Massachusetts seems to be switching back to red-on-
white plates.  At least we'll be able to tell that red-on-white plates on
the *front* of the car is a phony!

        And now, a collection of plates I have seen recently:

        BLU IZE Almost a verb!?!
        32MANY  Three too many what?
        BEES    I didn't see KNEES anywhere...

        +SAAB+  On a truck. (Not a Saab!)
        SUB PRO Obviously in reference to the IBM PC!
        LAAAAH  Huh?
        NNNNNN  See LAAAAH.
        ME-N-U  I've been around computers too long.  I
                thought it said "menu".
        03033   Someone at the Brookline (NH) Post Office
                has this one.  Brookline's zip code is 03033.
        BABYRD  Is this "Baby Rural Delivery" or "Be A Byrd"?
        USED2B  Used to be a byrd?  This one was right behind
                the BABYRD one!

All those songs.  All those authors.  And all those contributors.  Not
one mention of a song perfectly suited for repeated play in, without
mincing words, a nut house.  When the feeling crazy mood stirs in my head,
as I'm sure it must often do in the heads of the intended audience, a very
pleasant sound is that of Z.Z Top performing Beerdrinkers and Hellraisers
at high decibel levels.

In a previous life, when I was a TOPS-20 Field Software Specialist,
I sometimes had occasion to investigate system crashes.  TOPS10 and
TOPS20 both place an image of (core!) memory in a file usually referred
to as the crash dump file (I don't remember the exact file name).  One
then used DDT or FILDDT to look at the dump, complete with monitor symbol
tables (on the -20, anyway).

Which leads me to an anecdote.  I once paid a visit to a small university
in Ft. Lauderdale to provide them with some startup consultation.
One of the professors wanted to teach an assembly language course.
The method he proposed for doing lab work (on a -20) was for the students
to prepare job batches (on CARDS! I believe), submit them for execution,
and then force a crash dump (ABEND in IBM-ese) so they could look at
the state of the machine, registers, memory, etc.

Well, he just couldn't figure out how to get that gol-durned machine
to print out several pounds of paper with lots of octal (it's a -20,
remember?) numbers on them.  When he asked me how to do it, without
first explaining the above reasons, my immediate reaction was, "But
why would anyone want to *DO* such a thing?"!  I then went on to
explain that NO ONE on -20's ever needed such an archaic (probably
not my exact words) method.  He then enlightened me as to reasons
for wanting it.  Not wishing to change his teaching method (i.e.
let the students actually *LOG ON* and really *USE DDT*, we finally
arrived at a solution...I wrote a Fortran program for him that would
print the contents of memory in Octal on paper, which could be
included as a subroutine in the students' programs.

Couldn't resist replying to this! When I first start programming (yep,
that's what it was called before we all went up-market!) we regularly
debugged using a PMD. These were also the operator's tool for expressing
their disgust at the inadequacies of a programmer whose pride and joy had
"looped" or "op-code trapped"

And this was all happening 20 (yes, twenty!) years ago on a UK machine
called a LEO III, which incidentally, had multi-programming, overlaying and
relocatable programs. LEO stood for Lyon's (Company name, as in Lyon's
Corner House!) Electronic Office, and the III was the descendant of the
first commercial computer, built by Lyons because they couldn't find anyone
else in the world willing to undertake the task!

And, yes, I'm still trying to automate the office. Ho-hum.

I had the luck to use a couple of european machines before I join
this three letter company. ICL's 1900 machines with GEORGE 3 and 4
operating systems offered PDM with symbolic printout and compressed
arrays and variables marked as "undefined" or "zero". GEORGE (which
might stand for georgeous) was a operating system I loved a lot, besides
other things. It was an advanced time sharing system compared with
todays TSO, ... an other strange stuff.

USENET has umpteen billion random discussion groups.  Too many
for any sane person to follow.  Recently, they have started to
summarize the discussion in a few of the groups -- the assumption
being that people might want to read a weekly summary and jump
in when anything interesting gets going.  You might find the

                        Summary of net.suicide

                     Jan. 1, 1984 - Jan 31, 1984

                                by

                              Chuck F.

        After several months of inactivity, net.suicide once again
        sprang to life as mr. mincemeat made a "bold" bid for control
        of the newsgroup.  Historically, this newsgroup has always
        benefitted from authoritarian direction; both the quantity and
        quality of submissions increase discernably.  However, experienced
        readers agree that mr. mincemeat lacks the charisma
        and steely discipline required for leadership.  While comparisons
        with rabbit!bimmler inevitably surface, it is clear that Ms.
        Bimmler's ability to command respect (arising equally from admiration
        and fear) is sadly lacking on both counts in mr. mincemeat's
        indisputable makeup.  In this context, mr. mincemeat's pathetic
        contributions can be seen as nothing more than, so to speak,
        misdirected spray, perhaps the result of some tragic
        physical deformity.  Subscribers to the newsgroup trust that
        next time he will at least raise the lid.

        Other topics of importance in net.suicide included a few bits of
        gossippy history from Bob Lied, a request to jj to reactivate
        Bimmler's account on rabbit, and several exceedingly boring
        attempts at amateur psychoanalysis.  Our close friend, Gene
        Spafford, submitted a long, impassioned, well-reasoned and
        cleverly written article that seemed to be about nothing in
        particular.  Many suspect he is in cahoots with mincemeat.

        Well, that's it until next time.  Remember, in net.suicide,
        no news is good news.

I finally got an answer identifying W. Edward Deming.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: PARSEC::TURNER
To:   KERMIT::PARMENTER
Subject: Deming

No kidding, NO ONE's offered to enlighten that poor fellow yet?  Well, here's a
quickie.  Dr. (I think) W. Edwards (I think) Deming is an American industrial
consultant who went to Japan in 1950 to contribute to their reconstruction by
training mgt in his techniques, particularly quality control and decision-
making.  He is revered there: they give him the credit for Japanese industry
being where it is today.  All things considered, this has recently tended to
strike American industry as a pretty good recommendation, which is why you can
find DEC training tapes presenting his 14 points, his 7 techniques, etc.; and
why Central Quality Group has just announced a Deming Workshop (if you call
the Registrar -- DTN 249-4760 -- you might get a name for further inquiries).

At the Quality Workshop, myself, I was told that "Quality Costs More Money" is
a big myth, it costs less.  Nice theory, I said: what I need for my CC Mgr is
the proof.  Chris Strutt replied: boy are you gonna love the Deming workshop.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The poor fellow who asked about Deming was the founder of the Quality
Workshop and Deming enthusiast, Lou Cohen, who was just engaging in a
little sly publicity, which took a while.  You can learn a lot from
the Quality Workshop about what goes into a product and how crummy work
costs money, despite the economic arguments in favor of crummy work:  time
pressure, move the hardware, nobody cares, etc.

And, if DEC's policy is still 'Do what is right for the company and
the customer', then quality fits right in, wouldn't you think?  There
are some really shocking DOA rates for our machines.  Anyone care to
guess (or quote) some figures?  I mean, if I'm going to be working
here, I don't want to be embarrassed about it.

I read the account of the famous SAVe RSX war story given in the noble pages
of Desperado and thought back to the magic session in Ottawa in which the
individual related it. It was the first magic session run at a Canadian
DECUS, and I had been asked to stage it. The person in question was extremely
shy, and only related the story after much encouragement.

The site in question is at the Department of Nuclear Physics, McMaster
University, Hamilton, Ontario. The reason I remove some of the anonymity
surrounding his amazing triumph with his 11/40, SAVe and the liquid nitrogen,
is because he was completely shafted by DEC's Software Services!

He almost didn't speak during the session because he was completely fed up with
DEC software personel (of which I was one). It seems that his University had
bought a Fortran IV release kit and licence. They had found a genuine problem/
bug, which they reported during their warranty period. Apparently the local
software services manager (possibly Toronto) refused to do anything about it,
or accept an SPR because they did not have their RSX system on DECsupport,
even though they were running the latest release.

I am always amazed when this company deals with customers in such a shoddy
ways. It is even sadder that he provided a number of people within the company
with the entertainment of his war story. I tried to do something for him, with
regard to the Fortran IV problem, but failed.

If anyone out there can help him, or can influence his software support
manager, please try. After his experience with the 11/40, I think the man
deserves a reward!
