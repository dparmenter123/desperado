Subject: Kidder &amp; West

   Here is some of the gossip from the session with Tracy Kidder, author
of The Soul of a New Machine, and Tom West, a key figure in the book,
at the Computer Museum in the cafeteria of MR1 on Sunday afternoon:

   It was an informal question and answer session -- Tom West had come with
a 3- or 4-page talk, but he never got to give it. Before West got started,
Kidder announced he had nothing prepared and started taking questions. They
handled things in a free-wheeling style from then on. They didn't take the
opportunity to close their question and answer session with the speech.

   Of the two, West was the more articulate. There is serious interest in
making a movie of the book (the director of the Paper Chase is consulting with
Kidder). If that happens, Tom West could easily play Tom West. There were
times when West paused and carefully formulated his answer (as
when he was asked what happened to the competing design for a 32-bit
machine -- his response was something like: "The competing design is very
much alive. It would be naive to think that Data General intends only to
build up and down on the existing technology. It would be naive to think
that there is no interest in taking advantage of some of the things we
perceive on the horizon..."), but generally both were quite spontaneous
and at ease. Each used the term "defend" a couple of times; both acknowledged
the ambivalence in their relationship.

   West described the odd experience of getting up and coming down to
breakfast one morning, only to find Kidder sitting at the breakfast table,
steno pad open, interviewing his wife and daughters. On the other hand,
Kidder's ubiquitous presence and pad was useful to West: Kidder was the
"best early warning system available." In fact, West recommended that every
project manager hire a person off the street, teach the art of note taking
in a steno pad, and send that person out to interview incessantly, just to
find out where the team members are.

   When asked how Data General reacted to the book, Kidder said he had got
no flak. He'd been worried about their reaction -- they had no control over
the content -- but "They do have lawyers." West likened his personal reaction
to several years of psychoanalysis in 24 hours. The individuals quoted in
the book each signed  a release (standard journalistic practice according to
Kidder), but although each knew what he or she had said, no one participant
saw what the others had said until the story was written and in galleys.

   Even at that stage, as the book was about to be released, people at D.G.
didn't know how to predict the public reaction to what most participants
felt to be an accurate picture of how they earned their living. West argues
that even now that the book is out, people don't know how to react to the
story. Reviewers have called him a Machiavelli, a Horatio Alger, a Gatsby,
and a Draco. He concludes that people are still searching for metaphors to
describe their response to the story. The general loss for words is a symptom
of the maturity of the industry as a whole -- people don't know how to
respond to computers or the people who make them.

   When asked who buys the book, Kidder pointed out the book industry has no
way of knowing even how many are sold, let alone to whom. On the basis of the
autographing sessions he has attended, he suspects that two types of people
buy the book: those who send the book home to Mom and Dad because that's easier
than trying to say it themselves, and those parents who have a child in
college who is interested in computers or who they think ought to be interested
in computers.

   When asked why the software side of the project did not receive much
attention, Kidder told the story of the drunk who searched under a streetlight
for a coin he had lost a block or so away. The reason for searching under the
streetlight was that the light was better there. The selection and emphasis
in the telling of the story reflected the sources and time available. Kidder
said he understood the software development was at least 50% of the project.
West said almost immediately afterward he took it to be about 80%.

   Nobody planned the book to be a Pultizer prize-winner. Kidder got sent
to West by his editor at Atlantic - Little, Brown. At first it was to be
the definitive book on computers. After some library work, Kidder decided
there were enough boring books of that type. Next it was to be the book on
minicomputers. Finally it got to be the (partial) story of one machine.

   Asked how the book changed their lives, they both said they are doing the
same thing they were before. West is building computers at D.G., and Kidder is
writing a book on atmospheric research, learning how scientists use technology
to do free radical chemistry in the stratosphere. Kidder remarked that
book-writing is much like computer-building: part of the reward is being able
to do it again.

Desperados, famous for their scrupulous attention to
language, may be interested in the latest HoJo solecisms.

I had this weekend the unfortunate opportunity (necessity?)
to eat in a Howard Johnson`s on I-86. The restaurant offered
postcards (not pre-stamped) to the president of HoJo so that
customers could register complaints or praise about service.

Among the questions on the card were:

        "Did the server introduce themself by name?"

This is an interesting way of getting around the gender
issue of indefinite pronouns. Garish, but interesting.
Also, note that "server" has replaced the gender-specific
"waiter" and "waitress."

        "Was food quality and preparation good?"

Well, no. It weren't.

        "Were restrooms clean and supplied?"

Ahh! They got the plural of the verb right, but missed the
idiom. The restrooms were supplied -- hell, there were two
of `em -- but ain't no T.P. in one. The idiom is
"well-supplied."

        "Please leave at cash register or drop in the
        mail."

Actually, I was planning on using the door. Yeah, I know:
sarcasm, sarcasm. It's just that I've always been a fan of
the direct object.

P.S. My companion noted, with her characteristic attention
to detail, that there were only 13 flavors available.
Shocking! And to think that Howard Johnson`s got its start
along with Eugene O'Neill!

Subject: these government stats just in

unemployment is up
crime is down
army enlistment is up

they (our government) says that crime is down because more folks are
home watching their kids, so the get into less trouble (more like
their kids are keeping them honest..., there is less to steal and
there are more people watching what is left...)

they (...) say that enlistment is not up because of unemployment, but
because of a rise in national pride (apparently the employed are enlisting
to show their support of a system which let them keep their jobs, and
they are ready to fight to defend those people who can't get them...
or the criminals (who are not unemployed, right?) are joining up
because of a lack of work...

(these exact figures from the local rock stations news, no details follow)
