Subject: Skunk removal

A few years ago, we had a skunk decide it was going to nest it up in our
garage.  The town "dog catcher" decided he didn't work on weekends (it
was a Saturday).  So we were faced with what to do.  We called a pest
terminating service, and they suggested mothballs.  So we threw moth
balls all in and about our garage, and as soon as we were out of the
skunk's eyesight, whoooshh, out the door.  Try spreading mothballs
around.

RE:SKUNK, don't worry about it. It will go into hibernation soon, or be
run over by a car, hopefully the former.

I have heard that you can discourage skunks from visiting your lawn
by installing a sprinkler.  Apparantly skunks hate to get wet.  It
makes them think that they're taking a bath.  I don't know if you have
to leave the water running, but I wouldn't advise turning it on when
the skunk is already there - he/she might think that was grounds for
retaliation.  If you know what time (like evening) he/she shows up,
you could probably turn it on a 1/2 hour before that.

Solution No. xxxx, not for coffee-lovers:

First you make a pot of coffee, then you turn off all the water,
then...

    and since water is short, the rats drink it and die."

No one answered ADVISE::COHEN's query about who was Deming, so he's
seen you and raised you one.

Does he plan to do surveillance with a Novoflex, or do you surveil Novoflexes
with one of these?  And how do you get marfak off a tercel?

I'd love to own a Novoflex surveillance kit.  But I don't want to pay the
going retail price.  Does anyone know of a cheaper alternative?

From the Pro 350 Pocket Service Guide, p. 49, Step 5 of the instructions
on removing an I/O board from the card cage, comes a new experience
in sound:

        5.  Turn the handle to the right 90 degrees.  The
            pin-spreading sound is normal for this type of
            connector.

31 replies and they haven't even gotten to key debouncing yet.  It took 23

Subj:   hot rumor about a new, fuller bell.

Guess what's on the vine down in the Mill !!

Sam Fuller was made a VP yesterday.  Sam is head of Corp Archetecture
and strategy, or something like that.  Now he's a VP as well.
I suspect he's replacing Gorden, so we now have the Fuller Bell.....

This could be worthy of noting to Desperado, whose readers have
a right to know this stuff before they see it in the Globe...... Jer

This is from one of the many EDT manuals.  It describes one of the
so-callled nokeypad commands.  What is it?

  (Null)        Moves the cursor the specified number of entities
                This command has no name.  You simply specify the
                entities over which or to which you wish to
                move.

Why is the Maharishi Mahesh Yoga into unified field theory anyway?

The latest rage among the meditators is "hopping", or, as Westerners
know it, extremely short-range (less than a yard) teleportation of
self.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: EVE::RUZICH
To:   KERMIT::PARMENTER
Subject: Gurus and Uncertainty

Why the mention of unified field theory?  Well, you see, before the
Maharishi went off in the wilderness to study with Guru Dev, he was a
physicist.  Also, one of the higher-ups in the organization is a
Princeton physicist, who was head of Maharishi International
University in Iowa to last time I had anything to do with the TM
organization.  (My last contact was about eight years ago.  I have
nothing against the organization, I've just had more pressing business
since, like earning a living and raising a family.)

You would expect someone like the Maharishi to explain the cosmos in
Hindu terms.  This does happen, but with some surprises.  E. g.,
remember Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, with particles
disappearing and appearing?  Suppose this happened to a great number
of particles, in a coordinated manner.  The result would be movement
in violation of Newton's ideas: Levitation.

I've only had the required college physics for an engineer, so I
probably didn't ask the right questions when I heard this.  So don't
press me for more details, or try to refute this idea.  I won't argue
it one way or the other.  I just thought that the DESPERADOs might be
interested in some background information on all this.

The TM folks are absolutely serious about their ideas, by the way,
even to the point of trying to prove them in a respectable way.  They
probably still have reprints of the Scientific American article
detailing the effects of Transcendental Meditation on human
physiology, especially blood chemistry. (The effects include lowering
of oxygen consumption to a lever below that of sleep during
meditation, and reducing for hours the amount of a blood chemical
related to stress.)
