We open this issue with a quote from a Dave Barry column. I love
Dave Barry and think he's terribly funny. I don't use him here
because he has a wide and effective distribution on his own hook,
not including those publications that actually pay him for the privilege.
But the following, the lead paragraph from a recent column on the hot
Christmas toys this season, is such a handy lead-in to the next piece:

    What? Can it be?! Do I hear Johnny Mathis whining "Winter Wonderland"
    over the public address speaker at the K mart, in between announcements
    for the Blue Light Special? Can the Holiday Gift-Buying Season really
    be upon us again, so soon? Ha ha! How delightful! Somebody fetch my syringe!

If that's the way you feel, read our first item. Cut it out and paste it
on your sunvisor. You'll need it.

Subj:   Travel Tips for relaxed driving in Nashua

10.1 Tips for Traveling 101A

If your car is stuck in traffic on one of Nashua's busy roads (Route 101A,
for example), try these handy tips for stress reduction, courtesy of Nashua
Brookside Hospital.

1. Smile at attractive men and women in nearby cars.
2. Imagine floating in the clouds watching a traffic jam below.
3. Think of relaxing scenes:
   Lying on beach - in hammock - on a boat - etc.
4. Put on relaxing music.
5. Imagine flying through the sky as Superwoman or Superman.
6. Picture a favorite movie you have recently seen.
7. Imagine someone you dislike (your boss, mother-in-law, insurance salesman)
   in their overheated car behind you.
8. Imagine sitting near the ocean - breathe deeply, inhaling as the tide
   comes in and exhaling as the tide goes out.
9. Practice alternate tension and relaxation with your fist. Make fist as
   tight as it can until muscle trembles, then relax hand. Do this with
   different parts of your body.
10. Imagine a microscopic person with an oil can going through your blood
    and lymph glands. Every time he finds a tense muscle or joint he oils for
    relaxation.
10.1 Imagine some ridiculously funny scene. Laugh until you can't stop any
     more.

Seems a snail crept into a Nissan dealership, climbed onto a chair, and
told the salesman that he wanted a 300-ZX.  The salesman was understandably
skeptical and he told the snail that no one would loan a sea creature the
money to buy a sportscar.

The snail reached into his shell and whipped out fifteen thousand dollars in
cash.

The salesman hid his surprise and counted the money.  Then he said, "Mister,
you just bought yourself a car."

"Not so fast," said the snail, as the saleman led him to his new car.
"First, you have to scrape off the letters 'ZX' and paint in an 'S'".

"S for snail", the salesman thought, and he called the body shop.  "No
problem",they said, and in a minute a workman came out and took the car to
the paint bay.

Soon the car was ready, so the snail hopped in, fired the sucker up, and
roared off the lot like a bat out of hell.  The salesman watched him leave,
duly impressed, and just as the snail blasted out of sight the salesman
turned to his sales manager and said:

"Man, did you see that S-car go?"

With a cold wind -- the like of which is only found in graveyards -- tearing
at our coats, the graveside mourners broke into little groups and headed
for their cars.  I fell in beside the softspoken priest who had
officiated and started in on a little smalltalk.  He mentioned in
passing that he had recently done a wedding where the reception was held
at the Sheraton Tara in Nashua. "Oh yes," I said, "I know that place. I
work next door at the Digital plant."  I didn't really expect him to
know anything about Digital, so I was surprised when he smiled slightly
and said, "Aaaah, Digital.  Up to 116 from 51.  Blessed are they who
held on."

                    CAN WE HAVE AN OPEN DEBATE ABOUT
                  WHETHER SMOKING CAUSES FOREST FIRES?

    The issues that surround smoking in the woods and forest fires are so
complex, and so emotional, it's hard to debate them objectively.
    Over the years, you've heard so often that smoking in the woods causes
forest fires -- and so little challenging these reports -- that you may assume
that the case is closed.
 exit
    Studies that conclude that smoking in the woods causes forest fires have
regularly ignored major arguments and findings to the contrary.
    For example, many people who smoke in the woods never cause forest fires,
and some forest fires occur even if no one smokes.  So how can smoking possibly
be a cause of forest fires?
    Besides, if no one was there to see the fire start, and the fire burned the
cigarette that supposedly started it, how can be sure that a cigarette was the
cause?
    The evidence about smoking being a cause of forest fires is merely
statistical.  Simply because a large number of forest fires start where smokers
throw their matches or cigarettes doesn't prove that the smoking actually caused
the fire.
    Many of the independent scientists who work for us or who hope to receive
our large grants believe that the issue is far from clear, and that more open
debate and research are needed.  That's why we spend millions of dollars each
year on research to see if smoking in the woods can possibly cause forest fires.
    During the coming months we will discuss a number of other key questions
related to smoking in the woods and fires.
    Some of the things we will say may surprise you, just as some of the things
we said in this ad probably surprised you.  We're even surprised that we had the
gall to say them.
    But we won't shy away from saying them, no matter how illogical they are,
because, quite frankly, that's our whole point.
    We believe that if we say these things often enough, some people will
believe them.  And that we can make any issue into a controversy by spending
enough money for large ads like this.
    That's why we maintain that there are lots of unanswered questions and no
simple answers about any issue that affects our profits.
    In future ads we'll try to convince you that smoking in bed doesn't cause
fires, and that smokers are more likely to go to heaven.
    Please keep an open mind about our ad campaign.  The best way to do that is
to be sure that your mind is empty.

Washington (UPI) - The American Civil Liberties Union, today, filed a class
action lawsuit on behalf of American women and blacks against the major
cigarette manufacturers for what it calls "the clearest case of discrimination
in US history".  Lawyers for the ACLU contend that the manufacturers are
conspiring with white American men to systematically reduce the incidence of
lung cancer among that group of tobacco users at the expense of minority and
other disadvantaged smokers.

The law suit follows on the heels of a report issued by the National Cancer
Institute showing that the lung cancer rate among white American men decreased
in 1983 over the rate of the previous year.  During the same period, the
report says, the cancer rate among women and black men continued to rise.

A lawyer for the ACLU said the case could take on historic significance if
the courts should rule in their favor.  "We want people to know we are serious
about this issue."  Calling smoking a fundamental right, the lawyer went on
to say that the ACLU would work with the offending cigarette makers to
design campaigns to increase smoking among white American men.  "We don't
want anyone in this country to be any better off than anyone else," the
lawyer went on to say.  "If it means killing off more white men, so be it."
Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, called the
NCI report "scandalous".  "We are outraged to learn that such inequality
exists in the lung cancer statistics," she said.  Smeal went on to promise
that the NOW would take a more activist role in helping what she called
"enlightened American men to become interested in this important
issue of feminism and equality."  She promised to spend as much as one
million NOW dollars to get the issue before the American people.  Speaking
on behalf of blacks, the Rev. Jesse Jackson called the statistics proof of
"an American apartheid" and termed the R.J. Reynolds Co. the "P.W. Botha
of the US".

                THE ART IS KIND OF AN ANTICLIMAX

              MACHINE OFFERS WORKS OF ART--- SIX BITS A POP

                         by Steve Rubenstein

   Art sold for 75 cents on Haight Street yesterday, exact change only.
The art was dispensed from a vending machine, the first of its kind in
the Bay Area.

   What came out of the machine each time three quarters were inserted
yesterday were a fabric doughnut, a piece of catheter, and a photocopy
of two gloves.  Total bill for the art: $2.25.

   It was art because the artist, Ona Lindquist, said so.  "This means
a lot of things," said Lindquist, holding up the doughnut.  "It oper-
ates on many levels."

   Lindquist, a conceptual artist from New York City, said that the
"Vendart" vending machine is her latest concept.  In recent months,
she has installed similar machines in a Manhattan theater and a
Miami museum.

   The San Francisco machine sits in the Forma novelty store at 1715
Haight Street.  Originally the machine was in a 1950-era ice cream
machine.  Lindquist removed the freezer unit and redecorated it.

   Art lovers insert three quarters and push one of three buttons:
"Artist of the Month", "Medical Arts", or "Men Without Heads".  The
machine whirrs and whines.  The customer raises a flap and removes
his art.

   "What's good today?" asked a woman entering the store.  Lindquist
smiled and shrugged.  "Try 'Medical Arts'" she said at last.  The
customer pushed that button, lifted the flap, and removed a small
plastic bag that contained a miniature cardiograph, some rubber tubing,
and a condom with wires sticking out of it.

   The woman held the baggie up to the light, as if that might be
of some help in probing its meaning.  It wasn't.  "This is very nice,"
she said, putting it in her purse.

   Lindquist, 33, built furniture before getting the idea for the
vending machine.  She said the machine was really a "participation
piece".  The best thing about it, she said, is watching strangers
walk up to the machine and try to figure out what it is.  The hardest
thing is making art small enough to fit into the slots, the size of
an ice cream bar.

   It does not really matter, she said, what the customer receives for
his 75 cents.  The important thing is interacting with the machine.
Coming to grips with it.  Relating to it.  "Actually, the art itself
is something of an anticlimax," said Lindquist.

Subj:   FCO RA81X-I-013

Just in case you haven't heard, we had a small problem with the RA81
manufacturing process.   The FCO describes the problem/symptom as:

        The adhesive used to attach the gaskets to the spindle air
        filter assembly breaks down at the upper end of the drive
        operating specification.   This causes head to disk
        interference to occur.

I guess that "head to disk interference" is "head crash", cleverly
disguised so as to make customers who've lost data feel better about
the noise that came from their drive.

I always thought "baud rate" was a baby puppy, since "baud" means "bit

rate."

About schlock music....

I never thought of "war horses" as schlock music.  Such put-downs seem to
me to be mostly snobbery.  If you have never heard some piece (like "The
Nutcracker,") when you hear it for the first time it IS fresh and new.
Music that happens to be accessible to a lot of people (which would make it
into a "war horse" eventually) is not schlock by definition.

I used to work for a radio station that specialized in "schlock." It was
WRSA in Huntsville, Alabama.  We radiated 25KW (FM) over a pretty large
market, on the order of 400,000 people in total.  It was a "middle of the
road" station, which means we would play the Beatles, but only orchestral
versions without words.  The jazziest we got was to play cuts from some of
the Peanuts sound tracks (which I really liked). "Easy listening music"
generally is what fits "schlock," but even then it is really a matter of
taste.

Certainly some of the more mediocre rock bands (like KISS) would be
candidates.  If the music is consciously contrived to be a "hit," or
otherwise manipulative (like music from the movie "Perfect") I think
classifying it as "schlock" is reasonable.  If you can feel the soul of
the performers or composers, then it is definitely NOT schlock.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
KISS isn't mediocre, it's pathological.

You can always refute criticism with a hearty "Chacun a son gout" or "De
gustibus non disputandum est" or "Sez you!" Nevertheless, criticism has a
place. It sharpens your own perceptions to react to someone else's
perceptions. Of course Richard Dyer talks through the back of his neck,
but didn't he make you examine your own reaction to the performance? Pauline
Kael's movie reviews can be infuriating, but they put a point on my own
feelings about movies.

But when you say that schlock is music that's consciously contrived or
manipulative, you have hit the bullseye and are entitled to a cigar or
coconut according to choice.
