        ...Ah, yes. BYOB. Known to millions as "bring your own booze", this
acronym has appeared on thousands of party invitations for years. But, the
other day I saw it used in its other context, "bring your own bottle". While
trucking along Route 101B between Candia Four Corners and Hooksett (that's
in New Hampsha for all you Pilgrim Platers), I saw those familiar letters -
B Y O B. Above it, however, I saw an unusual accompaniment:

        Mooo??

Subject: invention of video games

According to a recently broadcast item on National Public Radio, Spacewar
on the MIT PDP-1 was not the first video game.  Unfortunately, I heard
this item while driving down route 2, so I couldn't take notes, and I
have not seen it in print, so I do not have all the details.  However,
I expect that anyone interested (the museum for example) could contact
NPR.

They interviewed a scientist from one of the national laboratories
(Brookhaven, I believe) who ran a large vacuum-tube computer in the
early 50's.  He was given the task of showing off the computer on
visitor's day and came up with a program &amp; circuit to play simple
PONG-style game on an oscilloscope.  Apparently, it was the big hit
of the day, drawing far more people than the exhibits on nuclear energy.

This would seem to predate the MIT PDP-1 Spacewar by almost 10 years.

Following L.A. Decus in 1981, I met a few people in a Mexican restaurant
who were friends of my aunt, who lives in Los Angeles.  I was talking
with a middle aged woman, trying to explain what I did for a living, and
I mentioned "Silicon Valley" to her.  She echoed, "Oh, yeah, Silicone
Valley; I've heard of that."  I think she might have been thinking of
Hollywood Boulevard.

Subj:   Latest USENET newsgroup listing......

The following is a list of currently active USENET newsgroups as of
15 June, 1983.  There are two basic subcategories of netwide
newsgroups:  net.all and fa.all.  net.all consists of USENET
bulletin board newsgroups that are circulated around the entire
net; fa.all is a set of groups that are gatewayed to USENET
from the ARPANET.  The fa.all groups consist of mainly digests,
though there are some bulletin boards.  Some of the net.all and
fa.all groups are gatewayed between the networks, i.e. items
submitted from the ARPA side to the digest are split up and
submitted to the USENET group, while articles submitted on the
USENET side are bundled up and submitted to the digest.  To post to
fa.all groups, send mail back along the return address found
in the From line of the articles.  There are other subcategories,
but they are local, local to institutions, local to geographic
regions, etc. and are not listed here.  Please report any
corrections, additions, etc. to this list to me.

Subject: Waxing elephants

I was reminded of the bad writing contests recently while reading
the following excerpts from [booby prize to the first Desperado
who identifies the novel].  The novel was actually very good, but
there were places where the author overdid it.

  Spring lay strewn lightly like a fragrant gauzy scarf upon the
  earth; the night was a cool bowl of lilac darkness, filled with
  fresh orchard scents. ...

  Nacreous pearl light swam faintly about the hem of the lilac
  darkness; the edges of light and darkness were stitched upon the
  hills.  Morning moved like a pearl-gray tide across the fields
  and up the hill-flanks, flowing rapidly down into the soluble
  dark.

There were more adjectives in this novel that sent me to the
dictionary than in most of the German novels I've read recently.

Subject: Lanolin, and all that soft soap

I always thought lanolin was something they put in milady's face creams etc.,
and not something one put on wooden floors in the Mill.  Linseed oil (such
as one puts on cricket bats and wooden door sills to preserve them) would
seem to fit the bill.  Are they in fact one and the same?  Perhaps they
both contain the magical Chinese ingredient, lin.  I have a sneaking feeling
that we have once again taken the same etymological (lovely word) starting
point, and come up with different words.

Jeff.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Okay.

No Chinese.  Sorry.

Lanolin is a natural oil ocurring in the wool of sheep.  Someone
noticed that wool-handlers had unusually soft hands and began
promoting lanolin as a skin cream.  This was in the 19th of centuries.

In those days, the Mill was a real mill, producing all the woolen
blankets for the Yankee army and so forth, and, in the course of
hauling all that wool around, the wooden floors of the Mill were
saturated in lanolin, and so they remain.  On hot days the lanolin
boils up out of the floors and Millrats chose their footwear with
care.  Recently, some attempt--millions of dollars worth--has been
made to make the interior of the mill look like the interior at Parker
Street.  To this end, the Mill floors have been carpeted, but the
lanolin is soaking through.  And, yes, the interior of the Mill still
looks like nothing you ever saw, but now it has cubbies instead of
crannies and cardboard.

One lanolin product that was famous for fifteen minutes: NIL-O-NAL.

    I recently purchased one of the Beatles' butcher cover albums.
That's the one which features them grinning mischievously amidst hunks
of red meat and baby dolls.  The real cover still lies hidden below
the boring one, and I am wondering if perhaps any of your readers have
any experience with these covers.  So, if anyone knows anything about
glue, paper, or steam, or vinyl for that matter, please send me a
postcard or drop me a line.

The Boston Globe, in an article on local writers' use of word processors,
reported this week that Robert Nadeau (a/k/a Mark Zanger, the Red Chef,
and Mark Slackmeyer) bought a DEC PC.

And from Sports Illustrated comes word that the "Edge 1.000" software
becoming popular among Young Turk baseball managers (such as Boros of
Oakland and LaRussa of the ChiSox) runs on a "Digital mainframe in
Philadelphia."

Subject: How are those little suckers selling?

There have been requests for info on how well the PCs are selling.  I
don't have any definitive info, but an article in the June 6 New England
Business magazine has some interesting data.  The article is titled:
"Personal Computers: A New Battlefield for 128's Big Four" (where said
Big 4 are DEC, WANG, DG and PRIME (ignoring for now that the latter two
don't even have PCs.)

The article quotes George F. Colony, director of office systems research
at Yankee Group, a Boston high-tech research firm.  The interesting
portion is as follows:

        ... Sixty percent of the Rainbows sold are used in homes,
        estimates Colony; among the DEC Professional sales, 80%
        go into offices, and only 20% into homes.  By fiscal 1983,
        ending June 30, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. estimates DEC
        will sell $210 million worth of personal computers, and by
        fiscal 1984, revenue from personal computers will jump to
        $425 million annually.

What struck me first was the astonishing reported penetration of DEC
PCs into homes!  60% of a $3500 system go into homes???  I understand
that many (most?) of these are used for business purposes, but it is
still amazing.  Even 20% of Professionals (let's see - that makes about
4? [just kidding, folks]) into homes is amazing.  I wonder if these figures
are for real.

As for the sales volume, I have frequently heard that the Rainbow and
DECmate II are doing very well indeed.  The Pro is most likely hampered
by severe lack of software - this will probably iron itself out over the
next 6 months as 3rd party vendors actually start shipping software that
runs on the Pro.

I am still waiting to see books and magazines devoted exclusively to the
DEC PCs.  I discount "Personal and Professional" as that is put out by
the people who do the "DEC/RSTS Professional", and they are already in
our court.  Looking through Byte (whose latest issue contains two articles
on DEC PCs), it is depressing to see that 90% of the ads are for software
and/or accessories for the IBM PC.  Where is the similar stuff for the
Rainbow?

I just bought two whole magazines about the IBM PC, each more than an
inch thick.

And I thought it was bush that the article about the Pro in Byte was
written by a DEC marketing specialist.

But, did you see the ads for the Micro/PDP-11 in Time, Newsweek, and
Wall Street Journal?

A joke, recently heard from a customer at a show in California:

Q.      What is the difference between a bowling ball and a Rainbow?

A.      There is more software available for the bowling ball.
