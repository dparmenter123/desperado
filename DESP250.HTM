        Harvey Kurtzman made me what I am today.  Mad Comics was his
        personal creation from ground up.  He wrote all the stories in all
        the comic-book editions of Mad, did all the page layouts, designed
        all the covers, and set the stage for the modern understanding
        that there is a phony thought and a phony ideal behind almost
        everything that the culture pumps out at us.  How high a monument
        would we have to build to honor him?  A 900-foot-tall Little Anny
        Fanny would do it.

        Your key crime syndicate involvement in the Kennedy murders was
        through Santo Trafficante, the boss of Tampa, who was also the
        main man for drug importing, and therefore, ex officio, the mob's
        liaision with the CIA.  This came, probably, from the mob's deep
        involvement in -- read, ownership of -- of much of Cuba.  Thus, we
        have in one package, as discussed last ish:

                Cuba, including Castro assassination attempts

                Drug smuggling, which the mob, Castro, and the CIA have
                all been involved

                The CIA and its Monroe doctrine activities

                The mob

                The corruption of the FBI

                The anti-red movement, which attacked the Bill of Rights
                and seriously muddled any resistance to Soviet aggression

                The assassinations of JFK and RFK (and, given Hoover's
                hatred of Martin Luther King Jr., his assassination, too
                with emphasis on the mysterious "loner" James
                Earl Ray.)

                The death of Marilyn Monroe

        All of this is surmise, but lots of things that have never quite
        made sense look more sensible in this context.  What a field day
        for conspiracy theorists, and I have never been one, but, on the
        other hand, I never believed that lone assassin stuff.  Keep an
        eye out for the hand of the Illuminati.

        The TV shows, et cetera, have been inspired by the new Hoover
        biography that hits the streets this month.  Review forthcoming.

        Even paranoids have enemies.  You *have* all heard the theory that
        the CIA is behind the "Elvis sighting" stories, so that when
        anyone comes up with any links in the conspiracy, someone is sure
        to say, "Yeah, and Elvis is eating pirogi in Peoria!"  Diabolically
        clever!

        Some official or pundit opined that the World Trade Center bombing
        "the single most destructive act of terrorism in American
        history".  He meant, I suppose, the single most bla-bla-bla aimed
        at us, our government, our way of life, etc.  If you look at
        various destructive acts of terrorism committed by us, our
        government, our way of life, there are some pretty significant
        competitors.  The Mexican-American War of 1845, the War Between
        the States, the war against the Indians, the Spanish-American War,
        Hiroshima/Nagasaki, and so forth.  Terrorism is something somebody
        else does, not us, whoever we may be.

                                    =*=

        No account of the World Trade Center bombing that I have seen has
        mentioned the almost daily terrorist bombings from the fall of
        1969 through the summer of 1970.  Of course, the people
        responsible for those bombs could very well be writing in the
        newspapers now and waxing indignant over the World Trade Center
        outrage.

        Everybody in the military, combatants to clerks to the office of
        the joint chiefs of staff is serving alongside a homosexual.  In
        most cases, they all know it, but somehow it's hard to talk about
        it.  Some Defense Department thinker suggested the compromise that
        "they" should be prohibited from "announcing" their role in the
        great chain of being.  This is so far from anything in normal
        human communications that it is hard to imagine what he -- you
        know it has to be a man -- is talking about.

        The little woman (Mrs. Desperado) is letting her hair grow out.  I
        asked her if she was surprised at work when she caught glimpses of
        herself.

        "No," she said, "You know you don't look like yourself in the
        mirrors at work."

        It's true.  We wear these masks at work.

        DEC is leaving the Mill, announced last week.  Wanna buy it?

        I put in a couple of years there, one when it was really the Mill
        and one after it had been renovated, and while I'm as romantic as
        the next guy -- the next guy being Baudelaire -- I don't know that
        it's a loss.  The Mill was drafty, confusing,  uncomfortable --
        classically romantic, in other words.

        I've always been convinced that the confusing communications paths
        in the Mill -- take the tunnel through the air from 5-3 to 3-5,
        step out onto this open balcony and let the door lock behind you
        and go through that other door over there, both one-way doors --
        contributed materially and conceptually to the confusing
        communications paths in DEC management and DEC hardware and
        software.  "We shape our buildings and then our buildings shape
        us," said Winston Churchill, but in this case the building was
        already shaped when we got there.

        End of an era and all that, but . . .

                                    =*=

        I'm sure I've bragged about this before, but one of my greatest
        achievements as a Digit was leading a choir singing Christmas
        carols throught great chunks of the Mill and still arriving at
        Ken's office at the same moment as two other choirs that other
        people were squiring through other paths throught the Mill.  My
        biggest problem was getting them to leave the staircase with the
        good echo in it.

Subj:   Re: Desperado #3078: Clowns to the left of me

I watched the Frontline episode on Hoover.  I couldn't tear myself away.

I burst out sobbing when they said Hoover et al had gone to Pimlico
the day after Kennedy was assassinated.  I cried myself to sleep.

I never really cried about it before, and now...when ever I think
about it.  I catch myself occasionally falling into reveries of
what-if, which I also have never really done before.  Conspiracy
theories never really convinced me before.  What hits me the hardest
is how our national character was changed just because one person
was being blackmailed.

I suppose wars have been triggered for less.

Well, sorry to cry on your shoulder, but it's good to find someone
else who watched the program--I don't know anyone else who did.

But the image of JEH in a dress and fuzzy black wig is a classic.

On a not really related note, and I don't mean to pester you, but
I do remember one cartoon in which Pepe chases after a male black
and white cat with a white paint stripe--this may be the one in
which the cat paints the stripe to scare people.  I think it's
also the one in which we find out Pepe is actually solidly married.
(I don't think this one's seen very often.)  Pepe seems to think
the cat is female...ah, well, the last line in "Some Like It Hot"
is "Nobody's perfect", or something roughly like that, no?

Subj:   E. Palo Alto's claim to fame &amp; Guns in DC

&gt;the highest murder rate in the nation is in East Palo Alto
&gt;California.  their rate is around twice that of Washington DC.
&gt;(murders per capita per year).

&gt;/eli

&gt;    Likewise the gun ownership laws - and I know this is a subject of great
&gt;    emotion here - but the highest rate of murder takes place in Washington
&gt;    DC which has the tightest gun laws. It seems that murderers and drug
&gt;    dealers do not take the gun ownership laws seriously - but then why
&gt;    would they ..... and why would anyone expect them to ?

In absolute terms, Washington DC is the leader.  Even Oakland here leads
E. Palo Alto in sheer numbers.  But EPA has a population of 30K or
thereabouts.  So your chances of getting killed there as part of the
population is pretty good.  My advice?  Get a job at HP and move west...

But the problem in DC is heating up now with a debate over gun control
in Virginia.  The basic question is what good does it do to have the toughest
gun laws in the country when people can take a bus to Virginia and buy
as many guns as they want (VA has no limit on the number of guns you
can buy at any one time) with no waiting period.  The only restrictions
require a VA driver's license, which you can get in an hour with no
proof of residency, a second form of ID, and enough cash to pay for the
guns.  Turns out that VA is also the leading supplier of guns to NYC...

So that's how that works...

        I was watching the old Hitchcock flick "Rope" the other night.  At
        the denouement, one of the characters had to call the cops.  The
        scene was a large city.  Our hero simply stuck his gun out the
        window and fired three times.  Within seconds a crowd gathered on
        the street below and identified the source of the shots and within
        a few more seconds the police arrived.

        Try firing a shot out a downtown window today and see how many
        cops you draw.

Subject: Humpty Dumpty

Humpty Dumpty is an egg ... right ? Not so ...

In the Manchester Guardian Weekly there is a weekly column extracted from
the daily UK guardian called "Notes and Queries" in which readers ask
questions and other readers send in answers. One reader raised the issue
that s/he always thought of Humpty Dumpty as an egg but nowhere in the
nursery rhyme is he so identified ... he was certainly ilustrated as such
by Tenniel etc but what is the real story ...

It turns out that Humpty Dumpty was one of a pair of siege towers built
over 300 years ago. Siege towers were wheeled up to whatever castle or
religous cult you happened to be besieging at the time and your soldiers
would then jump over the walls etc etc. It was probably as tall as a house,
made of wood, had wheels and was probably covered in hides.

The tricky thing with siege towers was getting them in place - being heavy,
loaded with troops and inevitably involved going over rough ground.

Humpty Dumpty was built during the English Civil War by the Royalists ...
"all the King's horses and all the King's men" .... and it had a little
operational difficulty ... falling and being damaged beyond repair

In theory, code releases are carefully planned.  Successive versions of code
are scheduled, based on a balance between the needs of the customers and the
resources available to meet those needs.  At any given time, in a large
software project, several releases may planned, each with specified changes
from previous versions.

In practice, you get situations like the one described below.  It is taken,
with permission from the author, from the minutes of a meeting of an

My former partner, Lorrie Doyle, claims to have seen these on badges either
where she works or at a trade show in the recent past:

        Pigrammer

        Phrognamer

The impression I got was that the company for whom these folks work allows the

 She readied her camera, then held it
at her side, and took a number of surreptitious photos, without
aiming.

She probably forgot to take the lens cap off.  If she didn't aim,
she might not notice.  The subjects of the session could tell
by looking at the front of the camera.  (I've seen lens caps
advertised that are inscribed "Tell me my lens cap is on.")
The result would be blank, as reported, and not black or fogged, as the
photo clerk reported.

A well-crafted mystery story with a perfectly logical explanation.

Re Haiku in that last Desp...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Inasmuch as Desperado is now carrying Japanese lessons, although I'm not sure
&gt; which monster-ra invented haiku, please note that the word ha-i-ku has three
&gt; syllables.  Oh well.  Clever efforts anyway.  I move that we give credit for
&gt; coming close.

&gt; -- Norman Diamond     diamond@jit081.enet.dec.com

        Well, my source, the irascible nippophile Neil Keefe, states that
&gt;&gt;&gt;     while the Japanese word consists of three ideograms -- ha, i, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;     ku -- the actual pronunciation is two syllables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To clarify the lines &gt;&gt;&gt; above, the number of syllables in the word "haiku"
depends on if you are speaking Japanese or English when you say it. When
speaking English, it has two syllables. You can look up the word "haiku" in any
English dictionary, even our cheapy Digital-issued desktop one, and see. So,
you are counting correctly below:

&gt;        Twice five syllables
&gt;        Plus seven can't say much but
&gt;        That's Haiku for you.

&gt;        haiku's inventor
&gt;        must have had seven fingers
&gt;        on his middle hand

Norman's comment refers to the fact that the word "haiku", when written and
spoken in Japanese, has three syllables. But that is not what is happening in
your examples, which are in English.

Most words in Japanese will have at least as many if not more syllables than
the same word in English. An obvious example is the name "MacDonalds", which
has six syllables (Ma-ku-do-na-ru-do) when speaking Japanese, but only three
(er, four?) when speaking English.

To figure out how many syllables in a Japanese word (and to be able to look it
up in the dictionary), you write it phonetically using hiragana or katakana.
In the case of "haiku", three hiragana. Hiragana are not ideograms--they have
no meaning, only sound, like roman letters.

150th Anniversary of FAX
========================

Yes, believe it or not, 1993 is the 150th anniversary of FAX!
FAX is even older than the telephone and is probably the oldest
telecommunications technology after the telegraph.

The original FAX machine was invented by a Scottish physicist
Alexander Bain in 1843. Incredibly, Bain had to use jaw bones
and heather in his experiments to build the first FAX machine!

Although Bain's machine was sound in principle, we don't know if
it actually worked in practice.  It wasn't until 1861, when a
Frenchman named Caselli, built the first FAX network from Paris
to Lyons, that FAX became a working communications tool.

Caselli's FAX machines were 7 feet tall and used gigantic
pendulums to synchronize the horizontal scan line transmission,
a far cry from today's all digital FAX machines.

However, Caselli's FAX machines so alarmed the US Postmaster
General, that in his report to Congress in 1872, he made this
prescient statement:

" ...the probable amplification of the facsimile system of
Caselli, by which an exact copy of anything that can be drawn or
written my be instantaneously made to appear at a distance of
hundreds of miles from the original; and the countless other
applications of electricity to the *transmission of
intelligence* yet to be made, ---must sooner or later most
seriously interfere with the transportation of letters by the
slower means of the post."

For more information on the past, present and future of FAX
there is an excellent article in this month's issue of New
Scientist by Tim Hunkin.  Mr. Hunkin has built a replica of
Bain's first FAX machine which is now on display at the British
Science Museum.  Mr. Hunkin will also be talking about the past
and future of FAX on the television show "The Secret Life of
Machines" on the Discovery Channel, Tuesday night, February 23
at 9:30 PM EST.

'Explosive liquid' not crystal clear to NMSU fraternity brothers
Las Cruces Sun News

Some New Mexico State University fraternity brothers attempted
to blow up bottles of a clear liquid by throwing them off the roof of
a two-story building at 1804 Wyoming Wednesday, police said.

When the liquid would not blow up, they tried putting
firecrackers in the bottles to ignite the liquid -- that didn't work
either, said State Police Capt. John McAninch, commander of the Las
Cruces District.

The problem was the clear liquid was Crystal Pepsi, the new
form of Pepsi Cola, he said.

Although the liquid was in clearly marked bottles, McAninch
said the students told him they didn't know what it was.

   Blasting Cap Explodes in Man's Mouth at Party

   KINCAID, W.Va. (AP) - A man at a party popped a blasting cap
into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off
his lips, teeth and tongue, state police said Wednesday.
   Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank
during a party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne.
   ``Another man had it in an aquarium, hooked to a battery, and
was trying to explode it,'' Payne said. ``It wouldn't go off and
this guy said, `I'll show you how to set it off.'
   ``He put it in his mouth and bit down. It blew all his teeth
off, his tongue and his lips,'' Payne said.
   Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with
extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesman at Charleston
Area Medical Division.
   ``I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,'' Payne
said.

I had a dream:

Monday, 10 AM -- Chicago, Illinois -- Start-up software developer
Cuisine International announced CUISINENET, the first internetworking program
to seamlessly integrate word and food processing.  Called a
breakthrough for small restaurants and snack bars, Cuisine Chairman Mark Meigs
confidently predicted sales of thousands of copies with shipments soon to
begin.

Monday, 4 PM -- New York -- Cuisine International shares closed sharply
higher on announcement of new CUISINENET product.

Tuesday, 9 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Chairman William H.
Gates, III announced that Microsoft Food for Windows would soon enter
beta testing.  Gates described the product as the first of a projected
family of products to include Food for Windows, designed for small
commercial dining establishments; Personal Food for Windows, designed for home
kitchens; Portable Food for Windows, designed for lunchboxes; and, of
course, at the high end, Food for Windows NC (Nouvelle Cuisine) designed for
large institutional dining rooms.  Asked by a reporter about
CUISINENET, Gates said that he had never heard of the product, but was not
surprised by it, because the software business is highly competitive, and
Microsoft has to compete on the merits with many strong competitors, as the
FTC had recently concluded.

Tuesday, 3 PM -- Chicago, Illinois --  An angry Mark Meigs showed
reporters a copy of the nondisclosure agreement signed by Bill Gates, under
which Cuisine International had informed Microsoft a year earlier about
plans for CUISINENET.  Meigs said that in hindsight, he should never have
signed the agreement, as the only thing he learned from Microsoft was
that Gates was considering making changing to Windows.

Wednesday, 9 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
announced that Microsoft would soon publish specifications for the
Windows Open Kitchen Architecture (WOKA), a series of design specifications
to permit manufacturers of toasters, ranges, and other kitchen
appliances to integrate their products into the forthcoming Microsoft Food for
Windows line.  Asked about reports of a nondisclosure agreement with
Cuisine International for a similar product, Gates said that the other
product was really at most a niche product, and would probably have less
functionality than the food-related features that Microsoft would be building
into the new Unsaturated FAT File System which would be part of DOS
7.0.  Gates said that he doubted there would be much interest in a dead-end
solution that would not be able to keep up to date with advances in
WOKA.  Gates added that over 11,000 manufacturers of kitchen appliances
were already having serious discussions with Microsoft about WOKA, and that
he expected almost all important eaters of food to standardize on the
WOKA environment.

Wednesday, 10 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates announced that he would be giving the keynote speech at the American
Bakers annual convention on "Nutrition at Your Fingertips."  Gates played
down speculation that he would use the Bakers convention to introduce
Microsoft Food for Windows, saying only that alpha testing was proceeding
ahead of schedule, and the product would be shipped when it was ready.

Wednesday, 11 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Corporation
announced that its Chairman, William H. Gates, III, had made a donation of
over $250 of personal funds to the Cordon Bleu to begin an endowment fund
for the Bill Gates Professorship of Advanced Cookery.  The famous French
cooking school confirmed that it had agreed to be a beta site for the
much discussed Food for Windows application sweet.

Thursday, 9 AM -- New York -- PCWeek Magazine reported in a copyrighted
story that it had obtained a copy of correspondence from Microsoft to
Cuisine International, demanding that the small developer of kitchen
software cease using the Cuisine name, as it infringes on the trademark for
Microsoft Food for Windows NC.  Microsoft added that Chairman Mark Meigs
would also have to change his own name as Mark infringed a copyright on
the Windows Edit menu, Meigs infringed the trademark on Meigs Field in
Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Chairman infringed the trademark on Bill
Gates's title which he had acquired with personal funds from Mao's
estate.  Also, Microsoft advised that while the company did not actually
have to move out of Chicago, use of the name on press releases infringed a
trademark on Windows 4.0

Thursday, 4 PM -- New York -- Cuisine International stock closed at
0-bid, 1/16-asked.

Friday, 9 AM -- ? -- An anonymous spokesman for an unnamed Midwestern
software developer announced the discontinuation of operations.
Undescribed legal problems were cited as the reason.  Others speculated that a
failure to appreciate the competitive nature of the software business may
have led to the company's sudden collapse.

  Think again!

  Someday your fast-food burger may be prepared by the fastest of all
  possible cooks: a piece of computer-controlled machinery.  McDonald's,
  the people who gave us the clamshell grill that cooks hamburgers on both
  sides simultaneously, has taken another step in that direction.  The
  company has graced a number of its 12,000 restaurants with fully
  automated systems that fry your fries or pour your Cokes without the
  help of homo sapiens.  In fact, to get you your soft drink, the crew
  simply punches your order into the register, and presto! -- a cup is
  automatically filled with the appropriate flavor.  "All the crew has to
  do," says McDonald's spokeperson Jane Hulbert, "is ice it."

  McDonald's engineering department in Oak Brook, Illinois, developed the
  system, known as automated restaurant crew helper (ARCH).  Restaurants
  in Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, and Germany now have ARCH online,
  Hulbert says, and the system is "available to any restaurant in our
  system.  It's up to the individual owner-operator."

  Some observers have voiced concern that ARCH may be the harbinger of a
  fully automated brave new McWorld that deprives teenagers of much-needed
  jobs.  "Absolutely not," Hulbert states.  Actually, she says, ARCH gives
  McDonald's employees "a tremendous opportunity to work with technology.
  The crew just loves it."
