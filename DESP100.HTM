Now a little DEC noise:  The VT220 manual calls the feet 'keyboard

system programmers, and system managers.  No users . . .  Speaking of
VMS, the Digital Press has just released VAX/VMS Internals and Data

not appear in its 795 pages.  You have to read the code to find it,
but not very much . . .  One of the big features of the Cincinatti

hardware reliability and customer interaction are not critical

Bizzaro Traffic World: only in Mass. - legislation that permits passing on the
right (because so many were already doing so anyway). Next, legislation that
permits running red lights? Better to outlaw them altogether. All they do is
mislead the innocent into believing that they have the right of way on green.
Convert everything to blinking yellow; better yet, shut them off and save the
electricity for something useful, like emergency room lights for those maimed

Subj: Flaming smokers....and cool non-smokers?

Not to get myself or anyone else too inflamed about smoker vs. nonsmoker issues,
but simply to comment on the purported policy draft (as will be clear, I come
from the nonsmoker side): As with any corporate-wide policy, this one can be
sniped at from either end of the spectrum ("it doesn't go far enough" to "it
goes too far"). For example, I believe it's hypocritical for DTW (and other
house organs) to print blurbs about Smokenders and other such support groups,
while cigarette machines are allowed on company property. Probably the easiest
answer is to prohibit Smokender articles from appearing in the company newsrags?

As for smoking in one's office: anyone who's fought in the office version of
Space War understands the impossibility of achieving office arrangements that
isolate smokers from nonsmokers. Fans, smoke-eating ashtrays, good ventilation
(not to mention good manners and reasonableness on both sides) are probably the
only way to approach the problem. No policy can do what people refuse to do.
We nonsmokers should be cheered by the steps being considered (especially as
far as smoking in conference rooms is concerned), and use gentle persuasion in
other situations.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The 'no smoking in conference rooms' policy was to be supplemented by
smoking breaks during meetings.  Nonsmokers can eat an apple or do a
couple of pushups.

I should have known better than to take a course for which the
textbook title is: "Information Processing Systems for Management"...
I am sure that others would find it irresistible, but EDP is not my
idea of a fine time.

In chapter seven of this fine book, we come across the following sentence:

   "Original input in machine-readable form collected by online
    equipment can be validated by intelligence capability in the
    terminal or it can be validated for accuracy by programs at time
    of entering the data base."

I realize that it must have something to do with getting information
into the computer, as that seems to be the general theme of this
chapter, but exactly what it means is beyond me.

Thanks, OBLIO::CROLL, for your definitions.

It is my experience that about a decade ago
people generally used the term "firmware"
to refer to what made the 360 (and 370) "go"
(well, some people apparently thot it did things).
It was also called microcode.
There were also things called CROMs -- Control ROMs.

In recent years, however, it does seem that more and more people
are adopting the definitions you gave us,
and I for one am all for it.
We don't need 3 or 4 different words to refer to the same thing,
and any one of those words meaning 3 or 4 different things.

Back when I was first learning about all these wondrous things,
it occurred to me to pose the following analogy:

        HARDWARE:SOFTWARE::HARDWIRED:???

And my solution was "SOFTWIRED", which would mean that the actual
circuit configuration could change on the fly to be adapted to be
optimal at whatever it was required to do. Turned out, of course, that
writable control store tended to fill that bill.  But I've always sort
of wished somebody would build a softwired processor...

Subject: DECTALK on TV

I saw the DECTalk TV segment.  I was emabarassed to note that although
we clearly sent a good technical honcho, our fellow was inarticulate about
what DECTalk was and was good for and seemed not to have thought at all
about what answer to give a random layman curious to know what the thing
really did.  If they hadn't had the "objective" third party micro/PC
"expert" on even an attentive viewer would not have been able to pick up
on the notion that DECTalk is a) not a computer but an OUTPUT DEVICE,
b) has nothing to do with DECODING/understanding speech c) requires no
special format or recordings to operate.

The TI person though clearly a sales type with little understanding of
what the TI device did and was made a lot better impression with all her
canned answers even though most of them were buzzwordy and fluff.

Again, without the "user expert" the viewer never would have learned that
for any reasonable amount of input, one STILL needed the keyboard and for
that (as well as some unmentioned reasons) it was really NOT that suitable
for handicapped use - though they were clearly pushing it for that.

All in all, I was disappointed in how we showed up.  I expect we really did
take the exposure seriously, but the response was inappropriate to the
audience.  Someone who was much more relaxed on camera and articulate
even though much less knowledgeable and junior would have made a much
better impression AND gotten the message of what DECTalk WAS over much
more effectively.  In the event, one was left with the impression that
DECTalk was for abstruse technical types and the TI machine was for savvy
PC people.  All the more galling because of its being the other way around.

I am in the market for a British-manufactured loudspeaker, called a
KEF Model 105.4. They normally sell over here for the ridiculous price of
$1850/pair, and the best I have found is $1600/pair. I have heard numerous war
stories of folks who were able to simply walk into a corner-store variety
electronic shop in London and buy them for $800/pair.

First, is this true? (If so, it's actually cheaper to fly to London to buy
them! The import duty is only 6%.) How does the VAT work? If a non-UK citizen
buys them, does he need anything to avoid the VAT? Can he get it back later?
How about a British citizen (or a Swiss; I have friends who come over from
both the UK and Switzerland who might conceivably buy them for me, and have
them shipped.)

How would shipping charges run? Has anyone played this game (on similar stuff)
in the past?

Subject: Hopefully this story ...

Over the years there has been an ongoing argument over the use of the
word "hopefully". Most language purists argued that the word was
being misused. My opinion has been that almost everyone knew what you
meant when you said something like "Hopefully the economy will
improve", so why make such a big fuss about something so TRIVIAL
(sic).

Well, the arguments should now cease and those that have been
"misusing" the word "hopefully" have now been rewarded for their
persistence. According to an Associated Press article that appeared
in The Middlesex News (a Framingham Massachusetts newspaper) on
Thurs., March 8, 1984 (p. 2A) the great Oxford Dictionary
acknowledges that "Hopefully the eggs are fresh" is a legitimate
sentence.

Hopefully this story will end the arguments. However, we all know that
the arguments won't end. But at least we now have the great "Oxford"

One reason that Nashua has triangular manhole covers could be that
they are probably cheaper than round covers.  It takes less material
to produce a triangle of the same width as a circle.

Subject: The alleged Unfitness of triangular Personhole covers

I think I may now understand why people mistakenly conclude that an
equilateral triangle cannot fit through an equilateral triangular
hole with slightly shorter side (otherwise known as The Manhole Problem)
It is by false analogy with the case of square shapes.  There, the insertion
method is to hold the square so that one edge is parallel to the hole
(ground) with the center of the shape and hole aligned vertically, and then
to rotate the shape until its surface aligns with a diagnal of the hole.  It
then fits through with consumate ease.  The same procedure applied to a
triangular shape doesn't get it through its hole, or even come close.  But the
procedure is wrong for triangles.  They want to be aligned with one edge
being vertical (none is horizontal), and to then be inserted off-center, with
the surface parallel to and close to one the edges of the hole.  The geometry
is quite simple, much easier than drawing an equilateral triangle on a VT100.

        A               Imagaine that ABC is equilateral, and drop
        |.              the perpendicular from B to D.  That line
        |  .            is the minimum 'width' the triangle can present
        |    .              to the hole.  Two derivations of its length
        |      .            are easily supplied.  Since the angle at A
        |        .          (or C) is 60 degrees, the length of DB is
        |          .            sin(60) times the side AB.  If AB is 1.0,
        |            .          DB is 0.866025404.  Alternatively, one need
       D|..............B        only recall the justly favored Pythagorian
        |            .          Theorem and note that in triangle ABD, side
        |          .            AB is twice the length of AD; if side AD
        |        .          is designated 1.0, AB will be 2.0, and
        |      .            DB will be the square root of 3, or 1.732050808.
        |    .              You should not need a PDP-11 or a Rainbow to assure
        |  .            yourself that 1.732050808 = 2.0 * 0.866025404,
        |.              so the two answers are the same.
        C
                        If EFG is the horizontal equilateral triangular
                                    hole (seen sharply foreshortened), then
   E___________________________F        DB will have a ratio in length to EF
     .                      .       of 0.866025404.  It should fit through
         .              .       rather easily, even allowing for a non-trivial
              .    .            lip inside EFG to support ABC when horizontal,
                 .          and non trivial thickness to the cover ABC.  As
                G           to the general case, equilateral polygons with
                        a small number of edges are easy;  ones with a great
many edges approximate circles, and cannot fit.  The dividing line between
fitting and unfitting covers will depend on the width of the lip and the
thickness of the cover.

Following the strong theoretical analysis of Nashua peephole, sorry
manhole, covers, it must now be time to carry this investigation out
to where it happens.

Can someone please commit to getting the following questionnaire to
the Nashua administration department with jurisdiction for manholes:

1. Please provide statistics for injuries to employees arising from
manhole cover impact over the last 5 years, with comparison to the
national averages for such injuries?

2. Is specific retraining found to be necessary for employees coming
from working environments with circular manholes? Does such
retraining, if provided, include theoretical geometry studies?

3. Does experience indicate that employees are abnormally prone to
anxiety, depression or neurosis arising from the risk of falling
manhole covers?

4. Can you provide a historical summary of the events leading up to
the adoption of triangular covers? (Oh my God, it wasn't that Tesla
person was it?)

How about this for an *advantage* of triangles over circles: a
triangular cover may be rotated about its centre and then rested over
the manhole, leaving the hole partly uncovered *but* not occupying any
more of the road surface than the hole itself. With a circular cover,
you have to put it right to one side.

This is my turn to comment about triangles. First of all, people seem to
be confusing isosceles with equilateral. Second, there are a bunch of shapes
which exhibit the property of not falling through a properly designed
recepticle. Some examples can be found from British coins. One coin has
seven sides, each of which is arced. The coin has a constant "diameter" through
any angle of rotation. I am certain that there is a crazed topologist out
there who can even come up with a formal definition for these shapes. Me, I
am just an engineer.

there is a whole class of shapes that satisfy the "can't fall thru the
hole" criterion.  these are called curves of constant width.
the circle is the obvious one.  the equalateral triangle is not one,
but with a little doctoring it can be converted into one.
think of the triangle as drawn on paper.  open a compass to the length
of a side.  using each corner as a center, draw an arc between the other
two corners.  you can do the same thing with other regular polygons
with an odd number of sides.

i think one of martin gardner's books has a chapter on curves of
constant width.

circles work best for wheels, and not just because they are easiest to
manufacture.

This is one of my all-time favorite articles from COMPUTERWORLD a few years
back, by a computer analyst from Lousiana State U, whose name escapes me.  I
thought all the Desperadi would enjoy it.  The name of the article is:

                    MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR MAYBEBOL

ENTROPY: The amount by which a system differs from its ideal state.

The second law of thermodynamics can be interpreted as saying 'Entropy
always increases with time'.  This means that as soon as a perfect
system is achieved, it starts to deteriorate.  This may be
understandable in mechanical systems where moving parts are subject to
wear and tear.  But what is not so evident is that the concept of
entropy applies to logical, or software, systems also.

It is no secret that 60-80% of every programming dollar is spent
combatting entropy - that is, maintaining existing systems.  If you
are involved with any commercial systems, think of how often
programmers have to code changes upon changes to that 'ideal' system.
Why is this always the case?  Is there any way to get around this
problem?

Let's examine the situation.  Many times the people requesting a new
computer system (the users) cannot define their needs precisely.
Often, they are not sure what they want or how to deal with certain
situations.  Many ambiguous features are left in systems with the
idea, 'We'll deal with that problem when we get to it.'

Programs and programming languages require exact and unambiguous
definitions to function effectively; solving an unknown or ambiguous
problem is next to impossible with today's programming languages.

As I see it, there are two possible solutions to this problem:

SOLUTION #1: Carefully and objectively resolve the system design to
achieve an exact problem definition.

RESPONSE: Who are you kidding?  Face it, people have been trying to do
this since day one and no one has succedded yet.  Every time they get
close, entropy sets in.

This leaves us with the second solution:

SOLUTION #2: Change the programming language.

Why not?  We're trying to sue rigidly defined programming languages
structured along exact lines to provide predictable and consistent
results.  This ob- viously does not reflect real-live applications at
all.  To handle modern complex situations, a more flexible language is
needed - a language with the ability to procrastinate and deliver the
silicon equivalent of a shrug.

After much research, deep thought, and trial and error, I have come up
with the outline of an innovative programming language which I call
the Multiply Analytic Bull____-Oriented Language, or MAYBEBOL.  The
following are some of MAYBEBOL's more attractive features:

IF...THEN...MAYBE.  An eloquent concrete admission of indecision, this
statement is the heart and soul of MAYBEBOL.

DO SOMETHING.  When those unforseen situations occur, the user is on
sabbatical in Africa and the project is due tomorrow, the DO SOMETHING
statement just might help you hit that deadline.  Example:  IF ADD-CHG-
DEL-CODE = "PIZZA" THEN DO SOMETHING.

Ideally, no one should have any idea just what might be done.  (Some more
adventurous souls may wish to set up a pool and bet on the outcome.)

GO SOMEWHERE.  Where?  I don't know, do you?

ON ERROR conditions.  The ON ERROR statement would have two possible formats.

1) ON ERROR GENERATE EXCUSE.  Everyone knows excuses are more important than
results.

2) ON ERROR FORGET ABOUT IT.  Self-explanatory.

In each of the ON ERROR conditions, control will be returned to the
main program by means of the GO SOMEWHERE statement.

GENERATE X REPORTS.  X is an integer from 1 to 32.  Users always
demand reports.  They take these reports and place them care- fully in
multicolored binders.  These binders are then stacked on the shelf,
giving the users a place to store their dust collections.  Since no
one ever looks at these reports, a great deal of time and effort can
be saved by generating them randomly.

COIN.  A built-in subroutine, COIN will return a character value of HEADS or
TAILS.  This can be very useful when making decisions.

GUESS.  The programmer doesn't know what to do, the user doesn't know what to
do, nobody knows what to do, so why not?

PRETEND.  As in 'IF BAD-DATA THEN PRETEND'.

SEARCH table-name.  The SEARCH statement will consecutively search a table in
memory.  Note that it is illegal to supply what to search for.  If somehow a
match is found, set the ERROR condition (see ON ERROR).

LOOP FOREVER.  A great time saver for the programmer.  Instead of having to
subconsciously invent subtle and hard-to-find infinite loops, he may now
declare them explicitly.

DIVIDE x BY ZERO.  Same concept as LOOP FOREVER.
