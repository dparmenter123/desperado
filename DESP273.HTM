Tom, your musings on your introduction to operating systems via RSX-11M
brought back a flood of memories, some pleasant, of being responsible for
the first edition of its manual set and working with DNC hisself.
A most impressive chap. Of course, my exposure to Dave came earlier, when he
and I were working on M's precessor, the much (and justifiably) maligned
RSX-11D (possibly indicating Debacle?) oops, my typing fingers betrayed me:
predecessor (phew! I feel much better now)...I remember being at a status
meeting with Cutler, Pete Van Roekens (the project leader), Hank Krejci (sp?)
et al, with Cutler complaining bitterly about the laggardly nature of some of his
underlings: "Is it okay if I hit 'em?" he asked (facetiously, of course).
Still the knowledge that he even entertained the notion was enough to inspire
me to even greater heights of endeavor. Producing the manuals for D was an
experience I vowed never to undergo again. I'm certain I had a nervous
breakdown, but was too busy to realize it while it was happening. Simply
awful.

Well, enough of these pleasant ruminations...on with life.

 Frank, this is life.  Are you confused?

 RSX-11D's greatest fame came from its service as the sort of
 dashboard or starter motor or aide-de-camp to the mighty DECsystem
 20, jealousy of which long-dead operating system/computer combo was
 recently revealed here by the leader of Unix (now *that's an
 oxymoron, kids).  Microsoft's biography of Cutler doesn't mention
 11D.

Subject: Boys will be boys, browsers browsers

We former users of Cutler's pre-Bill operating systems can appreciate your
comments on Unix, the operating system that denies its masculinity.  Oddly
enough, I posted comments not entirely unlike yours to one of the Linux
newsgroups.  They were discussing what to do next, and I suggested a Linux
that was as friendly as a DOS shell but not as stupid.  And thanks to the
wonders of symbolic links, it could have both a straightforward,
descriptively-titled directory structure _and_ the traditional filenames
that U-boys love.  Needless to say the only responses were flamage, as if I
had proposed, say, that Mecca host a Billy Graham tent meeting.

But I think I know why.  Ever notice who wears those T-shirts with the
daemons on them?  Unix is a demographic play.  Just as Star Trek and Matlock
don't share much audience, Unix belongs to a demo-group.   Mostly, it's
males born after 1956.

It's not old folks, though of course there are the wizened gray-bearded
exeptions who tell tales of Version 5 and who even may have seen code
written in B.  No, the older generation of computer geeks got started
elsewhere and probably stayed elsewhere.  Unix hit MIT in the early '70s and
spread under the tutelage of its evangelist, Get-em Young,  who gave free
copies to universities, when DEC actually expected some of them to pay money
for software.  A generation was born, not Gen X but Gen C.

And it's male.  Sure, so's computing in general, but Unix is special.  Its
appeal is to the boys who were too scholarly or just geeky to join the
frats.  But even geeks and nerds want the trappings of membership, the
secret handshakes, the code language. And that's what makes Unix so much
fun.  The obscurity is the appeal.  Once you've immanetized the man, cat and
grep, you feel like you've joined.  It's a frat for geeks, complete with
conventions, magazines, and a really good alumni job network.  I don't think
females have quite as much attraction to such clubs, but in any case
Unix seems to be a boy's frat.

How can you make Unix friendly to the other 99% of computer users without
spoiling it?  That would be like turning the Shriners into the Jaycees.
Exclusivity
is a plus for a private club.  I watched the reactions when the FCC proposed
dropping the Morse Code exam from one class of Ham Radio license, and it was
awful.  Once you've earned that ham ticket, you're a member of an exclusive
frat, and that silly old code is as much a part of the initiation rite today
as it was for grandpa.  The FCC was, to many, a party-pooper by opening it
up on the basis of a more relevant set of exams.  Same thing, only Unix has
peer pressure rather than the FCC to keep it pure..

Speaking of clubs, it dawned on me why the Smith family opened up
Cybersmith.  Back in the old days their original bookstore in Harvard
Square, Paperback Booksmith, prominently displayed its slogan, "Dedicated to
the Fine Art of Browsing".  That store is long gone, but nowadays they
charge seventeen and a half cents to use a browser.  Ah, progress.

Nice survey, and I pretty much agree with your sentiments.

Whaddya think of Windows NT?  My capsule opinion is that it's
a tolerably decent operating system, probably destined for bloat
in the VMS way, with a crappy user interface bolted on top.
Mind you, I haven't really looked under the covers much.

I've never had to program the Mac, but I seem to remember Apple's
original claim for keeping the OS and the hardware closed was that
they wanted a uniform user interface -- which for a while, they
largely got: the Mac programs that didn't "fit the paradigm" didn't
develope a clientele.  So instead, Apple cut itself off from the wider
market.

The sheer multitude of bug-ridden DOS/Windows programs proves to me
that there are a lot more people who attempt programming than there
are competent programmers.  Further, the dependence on this drug means
that, like COBOL, it will never go away.

What I find interesting about the Unix environment is how it seems to
inculcate the same attitude in its users as seems to have been held by
its creators/proliferators: not RTFM, but "RTF code".  Most of the
systems I've seen (cross-) developed on Unix platforms lack any
serious design documentation, and the user documentation is often far
removed from the reality.

 Unix users can't be told to RTFM 'cause there ain't no FM, and no UI
 either.  Since I've spent my entire computer life on fine manuals
 and user interfaces, I lacked sympathy for Unix, but now I think
 there's something there, something that the intransigent attitudes
 of the eunuchs has prevented from growing and flourishing.

In message &lt;199503231332.AA28262@world.std.com&gt;  you write:
&gt;  Windows "secrets" are usually arcane ways of tricking the system into
&gt;  doing what normal operating systems do as a matter of course, while
&gt;  Mac "secrets" tend to be how to find movies of the development team
&gt;  cheering the end of the field test.  Unix, on the other hand, is all
&gt;  secrets, with its minimal interface and its documentation consisting
&gt;  of ex post facto functional specs.

Too true, but I find the Mac no less arcane and intransigent.  If you
don't load it up with accessories, extensions, control panels, and
whatever the hell other obscure names Apple expropriated, you can't do any
"normal" things, either.  I *still* haven't found a decent DIFFERENCE
program for the damnable thing.  Plus, they have this attitude of "hiding"
all those "messy details" that you "shouldn't have to worry your pretty
little head about" (like error messages).

And a day without a system hang is exceedingly rare.  I wish they had
finished the field test before the cheering.

To think I once had a VAXstation that I deliberately rebooted every month
or so, just on general principles..

Apropos your comment:

&gt;  "This will end your Windows session.  Are you sure you want to leave

I've got Chip's Challenge installed, and I wired the "System Exit" sound to
be the "bummer" (of course, I've got a sound board, too, which you need to
make the .wav files do anything interesting..).

I now use UNIX all the time at work, and use a PC at home.  Yep, DOS sucks,
and Windoze isn't a lot better, but the reality is that there are whole lots
of things I can do with the PC really easily that I can't do at all with my
UNIX system (an Alpha workstation with Digital UNIX), unless I run Windows
in emulation mode, because, basically, the applications available for UNIX
(and most other non-Windoze non-Mac systems) suck wind, and are over-priced.

And, like it or not, applications, not the operating system, drives system
sales.

I'm glad there's still a market for the infrastructure that lets PCs be at
least marginally useful business tools -- which is still mostly on UNIX, and
with luck will still be on something other than MicroSnot's operating
systems until I'm retired.

 But why oh why oh why-o is it so hard to get to the applications
 that Windows has brought us?  I didn't really set out to bash any
 operating system.  I just wanted to question the notion that a RUN
 command was hard and endless clicking (with each click at a
 different location and therefore requiring a mouse move) was easy.
 How is a PRINT command "confusing computer code" and running two
 applications and clicking three times to confirm (with two optional
 cancel clicks available) is user-friendly.

 I saw a demo of Bob the other day:  more of the same, piled higher
 and deeper.

 Even on Unix a half-hour with a friendly user can set you up with
 enough aliases to do your work without fear.  (Just don't drop
 anything on the keyboard.)

Tom, the savaging of people who dare to disagree with one of the fathers of
Unix might indeed have some guilt in it, but it didn't feel quite that way
to me.

Had it been the billionaire "boy genius" of Redmond saying those things, one
might dismiss them as the arrogant rantings of a man who thought that he owned
the comupter industry (and its employees and customers).  But given the source,
the tone strikes me less as the smugness of someone who has the world at their
feet than the anger, laced with fear, of someone who is watching his brainchild
slowly going down the tubes -- for reasons which he finds incomprehensible.

One could easily imagine a member of the Betamax design team making similar
remarks about 8 mm equipment, as the VHS tide was rising.

Tom,

&gt; Further thoughts this morning while walking the pup:
&gt;
&gt; I have not the slightest doubt that Windows 95 will be a mess too.

This reminds me of a meeting I attended of an environmental group ("S.E.A."
in Princeton, NJ, around 1982, if you must know).  The leader had a great
idea:  "Let's get a speaker to tell us about fusion [yes, fusion, she knew
what she meant] energy and why it's a bad idea from an environmental
standpoint."  She didn't know anything about fusion energy, but knew it wasn't
solar...

Nothing like deciding that something's undoubtedly awful before looking at it,
eh?  Saves a lot of time and worry, or so my born-again or hardcore-feminist or
dittohead acquaintances tell me.  ;-&gt;

Other than this bit of polemical flaming, keep up the great stuff,

Eric Haines

p.s. no, I haven't really seen Windows '95 myself, but I'm willing to withhold
judgement until I do.

p.p.s.  I've got an old HP workstation and a Pentium PC with Windows, and the
only way they'll take my workstation away is by prying it from my cold, dead
fingers.  Guess on which one I'm writing this note.

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 My judgement tells me that if the momma's ugly and the daddy's ugly
 and the release is a year and a half late, the chances are that
 Windows 95 will be ugly too.  I could be wrong, but sight unseen I'd
 add that I don't have the slightest doubt that both Windows NT and
 OS/2 Warp will be superior.

re:"systems with 28K of memory"

While you mentioned memory, you didn't really go into that major change in
the world.  RSX actually was useful with as little as 32 kilobytes of memory
and that was multi-_tasking_.  To be useful supporing multiple users or heavy
personal use you needed memory management and that meant systems that were
much larger, say on the order of 128 KB.  But that was a pig compared to
RSTS (no /E) that supported 25 uesrs with 28KW or 56KB.

A few months ago as I was recalling our glory years in RSX, I thought about
the memory, the disk, and what we thought were useful minimums relative to
the sales and marketing types.

That thought lead me to begin thinking about computer systems in terms of
the years.  Rather describing the computer we just bought, we just say
"I just bought a system with the capacity of every system in 1960."
"Yeah, why so small, I bought a 1963 sixth months ago."

The problem I have is finding the data on computer systems, memory, and disk
sold by year....

Subject: Why UNIX is still in the shadows.

I have a theory about why UNIX is the way that it is.

        It is hard to understand ... on purpose.

For the most part the whole thing has the feel of a midnight hack,
grown out of control.  Clearly, marketing has never had anything to do
with the shell commands.  So where did the names come from?  Sotware
engineers thought them up, and they are too busy being creative to
stop and be consistent.  Also, since it apparently grew from a hack,
there was never anything with which to be consistent.

So, now it is a mess.  Who would drive the change?  Software
engineers, except they have no incentive.  Also, they *like* it like
this.  It is one *huge* puzzle.  It is at times incomprehensible.  It
often takes a ton of figuring out.

There is an unlimited amount of "getting better at it" possible.  This
is the sort of thing a high quality problem solver *loves*.  So, the
very people who would push to change it, love it the way it is
(subconciously for most) too much to change it.

Which leaves it a mess, and thus unsuitable for society at large.

 Well, WNT is *literally* VMS+1, of course.  It's obvious that WNT is
 full of neat tricks and way better than Windows, but the command
 line interface is *still* based on DOS!  Even the WNT propaganda
 disk apologizes for it.  The windows interface is based on Windows,
 but the disk *brags* about that.

 Are there journalists and industry sages actually in the bag to
 MicroSoft, weaklings who have sold out to the all-pervasive power of
 the mightiest force in the computer industry, who mold their opinions
 to what MS says because much bread and butter shall come to them? Or
 are have they observed the scene and concluded that MS is a big
 enough story in itself and they need go no further?  Somewhere
 between those two stories is a third, which is that MS is so huge
 that its reality is a large part of ours and that thus the MS point
 of view isn't merely what the company thinks but what the world
 thinks.  To me, it's a brilliantly run company with lots of nice
 products and a great handle on the computer business, but they've put
 two abominable operating systems out there (and one promising one).
 Until last week I (both sage and journalist) could stand apart from
 all that to say that the emperor was wearing far too many clothes?

 I should expand on that tantalizing remark about having just become
 acquainted with the Macintosh that appeared at the end of my little
 disquisition on your friend the operating system.  Literally in the
 midst of writing that piece I took a contract with Apple after
 lebenty-leben months of taking my shiny pebbles and bits of string
 from door to door without finding a taker.  So, on a week by week
 basis, my grits and gravy are being supplied by Apple.  Given the
 Gates paranoia about Apple and its sneaky Internet ways plus my
 naturally honest open nature, Desperados will be presented with an
 interesting puzzle as we continue to discuss this issue, to wit,
 where am I coming from?  Same old place as usual.

 Next issue coming soon, revealing how little I know about hot water.
