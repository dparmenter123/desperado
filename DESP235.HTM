        The Sports Collectibles Association International, a trade group
        for manufacturers of sports memories, is going to publish a
        book of authentic reproductions of the signatures of famous
        players.  "It won't eliminate forgeries, but it will help educate
        people."

        Leibniz said that back in 17-ought-and-something.

        Nowadays, we are experts in the art of consequences, right?
        Somehow, we have managed to do this without:

                - the art of thinking

                - the art of estimating probabilities

        There was a photo in the Boston Globe of a house (really a
        concrete bunker) buried in the ground with slit windows and more
        dirt piled on the roof, surrounded by "native low-water shrubs".
        Except for the glass in the windows, there was no difference
        between this structure and an abandoned machine-gun nest on the

        President Bush's foreign policy mastery:

                  follow through on the fight

                - bash Israel, despite the Israeli forbearance in taking
                  rockets during Desert Storm without counter-attacking.

        Oh, yeah, and President Bush is an expert on the people's
        dissatisfaction with Washington.  He ought to be.  He's been
        on the government pad fulltime since about 1964.  Congressman, CIA
        chairman, Vice President, President.  Yep, that's my list of who
        I'm dissatisfied with in Washington.

        I got a rival net-wire newsrag called CORE from the Electronic
        Frontier Foundation and even though I approve of almost everything
        the effers are  doing, I was surprised at the retro style of this
        publication, which has *poetry* and *fiction* (based on the
        author's life) just like a literary magazine.  It's a bit odd to
        read such old-timey stuff on the net.  Also strange is the
        disclaimer/offer, "CORE may be reproduced freely *in its entirety
        only* throughout Cyberspace." That, as we know, is not how we do
        things here in Cyberspace. Anyway, send stuff and requests to
        "rita@eff.org" and copy by anonymous ftp from "eff.org".  My copy
        (thanks Rik Kabel) is dated October 3.  The stuff in it is okay,
        understand, but it's just so like something with buff, tan, dun or
        dull green covers that you'd buy in Harvard Square and definitely
        not as Cyberspacy as we are here in Desperadoland.

                                    =*=

        Speaking of which, I have about 3000 lines of scientific/scholarly
        material on netlife, cyberspace, and the like that I'd been
        thinking of doing up, but it's a hell of an editing job and unless
        someone shows interest, I probably won't bother.  It's got CORE in
        it, I think, and two copies of "EJournal, An Electronic Journal
        concerned with the implications of electronic networks and texts"
        along with some other stuff of the same (mostly stuffy) ilk.
        Anyone for tenets?

        Apparently, Anita Renteria's memoir of B.B. King will be placed in

        him.

The winner...

Faces blanch and strong hearts fail,
At the very thought of PRESIDENT Quayle.
Spines are chilled and the flesh just crawls,
Tongues are tied and silence falls.
But let's just ponder throughout this hush,
Can he really be worse than Bush ?

A horse was made a Consul
By the Emperor Caligula
Historians may agree this shows
He wasn't too particular
But there are those Americans
Who argue with some force
You gotta give him credit
For using the whole horse

                James McKeon

When Bush turned pale,
Our fears of Quayle
Came quickly to the fore,
And many felt the Veep should be
By G.B. shown the door.
But Bush I think will not assign
Him to another station,
For Dan gives George a guarantee
Against assassination.

America, America,
Now in the hands of Quayle.
The man who put Latin in Latin America
Has now become first male,
And though the Yanks may hope it's a prank
(This man has the power to nuke),
We all have our stars and stripes to thank
Mr President's not yet David Duke.

Kennedy smiled his wondrous smile
And almost nuked the Cuban coast
Nixon smiled his cynical smile
And got exposed by the Washington Post
Reagan smiled his grand-daddy smile
And ate Grenada for Sunday roast
Bush smiled his tennis smile
And threw up all over his host.
When I look at that bunch,
I have a terrible hunch,
That Quayle would be better than most.

        So the stupidest thing about Quayle (oooh, big one coming up) is
        that he obviously never even once watched Murphy Brown or he would
        have known that she does have a husband (ex-), that he *is* the
        father of the baby, and that he's the one who's no damn good, is
        in fact a sort of Dan-Quayle-parody liberal who is so keen on
        saving the world that he has abandoned his wife and child to do
        so.

        I'll bet even Quayle's aides (the ones who think his thoughts for
        him) didn't watch it either.  They read in the paper that she was
        having this kid and they ran with it from there.  Maroons,
        maroons, what a bunch of maroons.

        And all the Murphy Brown writers wanted was a new piece of
        situation to make comedy about.  I can't wait to see what they
        make of Quayle next season.

        And, speaking of contempt for authority, check this next one out.

There is a new perfectly legit and immensely fun sporting application of
A1 emissions on X &amp; K band.  This sport even has a name, a set of rules
and a budding guild for practitioners of the art.

That art is, of course, Trolling for Tail Lights or Tactical Applications
of Negative Speed Insertion.  I am proud to be a founding member of the
National TFT Guild :-)

Here are the rules.  Use and Enjoy!:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Trolling for Taillights (and related Effluvia)
                          Draft 3.0 (05/25/92)

Introduction

Trolling For Taillights (TFT) is becoming one of America's fastest
growing highway participatory sports.  It is loads of fun, requires
only modest equipment and achieves justice on the highway.  And it is
Good Clean Fun (TM) at least until the target has to clean his drawers.

TFT refers, of course, to the sport of communicating to other drivers
by stimulating their radar detectors and observing and recording their
responses.  Only simple radio equipment is needed:  an old microwave
burglar alarm will do fine.  More sophisticated equipment such as
a Kustom KR-11 Instant On Moving Police Radar will yield better and more
consistent results.  Nontheless $10 worth of Gunn Oscillator will
achieve quite adequate scores if the proper skills are practiced.

How it Works:

Think of RADAR as a Tractor Beam.  It's a vector-subtraction
ray, a  negative speed insertion device: If the target is ahead,
it sucks them back toward you; if they're behind, it pushes them
away. One can also think of it as a high-tech version of the
American Indian game of counting coup.   In short, think of it
as evolution in action, as in Road Warrior.

Safety First:

Because the target of your trolling may react erratically, certain basic
safety rules are necessary.

*   No trolling of vehicles with less than two car lengths of clearance
    behind and in the lane to either side (if applicable.)  This allows
    for an Unindended Deceleration Transient (UDT.)

*   No trolling of Texas Cadillacs (pickemup trucks.) with large dogs
    standing on the toolbox.  The dog might not like it.

*   A minimum of 1/10 mile clearance between you and the target is
    required if the target is placarded with any of the following:

    "Flammable"
    "Explosive"
    "High Explosive"
    "Radioactive"
    "Nuclear Weapon"  (2/10 mile for this one.)

Special Awards:

It is desirable to recognize outstanding fishermen in our ranks.  Accordingly
the following special award catagories are established:

*   The Million Dollar Club - A million total points.

*   The Kilobrake Trophy - Causing one thousand Brake applications.

*   1000 Points of Light - Causing the most simultaneous brake lights
    in any one year.

*   Worked All States (WAS) - Snagging a trophy catch originating from each
    of the 50 states.

*   Golden Jam Award - Causing the largest traffic jam as a result of
    trolling WITHOUT involving a wreck in any one year.

If you think you qualify, contact the management for your award.  Video
tape is highly recommended for scoring purposes and for documenting
when the cop mistakes your head for a baby Harp Seal.

Rules of Engagement:

Trolling posture

    Proper trolling posture is in the right or next to right lane with
    the Radar at the ready but out of sight and de-energized.  Speed
    should be at or slightly below the speed limit.

Eligible Targets

    An eligible target is any vehicle that meets the above safety
    specifications and has a radar detector.

Target Selection

    A target proceeding at greater than 20 mph over the posted speed
    limit is the most fertile in terms of variety of actions and presents
    the best odds of winning Adders and Multipliers.

Firing techniques

    Forward - Wait until the target is a few car lengths in front of you
    and fire phasers.  Best results are achieved if the Radar is
    bounced off a sign or overpass ahead of both you and the target.  It
    is best to confine your range to that where you know your Radar
    will cause the target's detector to go full scale.

    Rear - Generally confined to eliminating Rear Bumper Dwellers because
    of the difficulty in scoring, the best technique  is known as the
    Annie Oakley style.  Simply lay the Radar across your shoulder and
    fire.  Since you are achieving line of sight contact with his
    detector, the results are spectacular.  The Tractor beam in action.

Setting up for Subsequent Shots:

    If you have a target that appears to be fertile for a repeat multiplier,
    the best technique is to wait a minute or two and then pass the
    target.  This encourages the target to resume trolling speed again.
    Lead the target for awhile to build his confidence and then lift the
    throttle and coast.  Allow the target to pass you again and when
    you achieve minimum clearance, fire again.  Repeat Phasors coupled
    with the vague recollection in the target's mine that you just
    slowed way down will generally lead to spectacular trolling.
    This technique can be use up to about 5 times (10 on yuppys and lawyers)
    on a given target before he figures something's up.  About the
    4th or 5th shot is the optimum time to set the target up for
    a nuke (see definition below.)  The use of an intergalactic communicator
    (CB) is vitally handy for assessing the conditions favorable
    for nuking.

Special Techniques and Definitions:

These techniques have been found to produce better scores than shooting
for lone targets.

Nerd Herding:  If you spot multiple cars equipped with radar detector, you
    can herd them into a cluster by zapping them each time one tries to pass
    another.

Wolf Pack:  Played by two or more cars in convoy, communicating on an
    obscure non-CB frequency:  Wingman trails leader by about 1/2 mile, spots
    targets and gives early warning to leader.  Leader fires rearward, hitting
    the marks with a strong head-on signal.  Wingman confirms hits.  Leader and
    wingman try to see how many marks they can herd between them.

Left Lane Bandit Blasting:  This dual purpose technique yields good scores
    and frequently busts up Left Lane Bandit clumps.  This is the one
    instance where  clearance rules are relaxed.    This is used
    when the trolling vehicle is stuck behind a bunch of left-lane-bandits
    proceeding side by side with geriatrics (real or premature) in the
    more right lanes.  If there are more than 3 or 4 cars in the clump,
    odds are one vehicle will have a radar detector and will be driven
    by a target who will respond to the troll even when going below the
    speed limit.  Also known as the Paranoid Factor.  Technique is
    to lift throttle (to give you some room) and firing into the
    crowd.  The inherent entropy introduced by the tractor beam
    will tend to scatter the cars so that you can find a way through the
    mess.  You bust a left lane bandit and score at the same time.
    Also known as "Bumper Cars."

Yuppy Puppy: Canine Critters, generally of a large/exotic/expensive breed
    and always an utterly stupid, undisciplined monster.

Yuppy Larvae:  Similar to Yuppy Puppy except of human origin.  Generally
    the result of her taking something seriously he poked at her in fun.
    Also known, depending on context and age,  as "accident", Yard Ape,
    Busted Rubber, Curtain Climber or Precious.  Personality characteristics
    are almost identical to the Yuppy Puppy except that the Larvae is
    louder and is generally allowed in restaurants and movie theaters
    where they do maximum damage.

Scoring:

Scoring is done in accordance with the following table.  This table recognizes
the added value of multiple hits on a given target and on the difficulty
inherent in getting multiple responses from one hit.

The easiest way to score is to get one of those handheld counting "clickers"
like are used by the gate keepers at the ballpark to count fans.  This
is that chrome golf-ball sized orb that contains a mechanical counter and
a pushbutton that increments the count.  Available from your local office
supply store for a nominal price.  Scores can be kept in a log book
for submittal to the management.   Winners (and L00zers) will be
recognized accordingly.

Basic scoring: What the target does:  Select all that apply and add.

Looks about, slows down                   = 1 point
Tail lights                               = 2 point
Hard braking                              = 3 points
Lane change                               = 3 points
Hides his radar detector                  = 4 points
Blue smoke from tires                     = 5 points
Hits an exit                              = 10 points
Turns off detector                        = 10 points.
Pulls over and fakes car trouble          = 12 points
Hits median and goes the other way        = 15 points

Bonus Adders:  Add these bonus points to whatever you got above:

Subj:   Texas is still the greatest state

From: harvard!postgres.berkeley.edu!margo (Margo Seltzer)

QUICK, BECOME A TEXAS RESIDENT
        provided by: Mary Baker

I'm so excited.

I just received in the mail my certificate of residency for the state of Texas.
(I don't know if you saw the recent Doonesbury cartoon talking about
how our president claims to live in Texas in order to live in a state that
has no income tax.  The cartoon suggested we all follow the president's lead
and file for residency.  The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, John Sharp,
was overwhelmed with requests, but took his commitment in true Texas spirit.
His campaign fund just spent $15,000 to print up all the certificates.  On the
back he asks that, since we're all spending so much on postage already, maybe
we could also send a few bucks to the Austin Texas Center for Battered Women.)

Here is what the certificate says.

This is to certify that &lt;your name here&gt; has stated in writing that he/she
intends to live in Texas at some later date and therefore - provided he/she
visits Texas at least once each year - is entitled, under precedent
established by no less than the President of the United State his own self,
to claim, for tax purposes, to be a

                Resident of the Great State of Texas -

a state whose greatness can be attributed not only to the beauty and diversity
of its landscapes, the abundance of its natural resources and the can-do
spirit of its citizens but also - in the opinion of many - to its lack of
a personal income tax.

                In the event that your own state (or the District of
Columbia) refuses to accept this certificate as proof that your are exempt
from their income tax, we hereby promise to send you a Texas voter registration
form so you can attempt to establish at least that generally-accepted evidence
of citizenship.

                In the further event that even this proves insufficient,
the Comptroller promises to send you the newspaper real estate section from
the Texas city of your choice so you may acquire a little piece of Heaven
for yourself.  That - along with your assurance that you intend eventually
to build a home on the property - should satisfy all but the most cynical
of tax officials in your current jurisdiction.

                But in the still further event that none of these good-faith
efforts proves adequate to convince your tax officials that you deserve
a break, we invite you to pack your bags, call the movers, kiss Aunt Tillie
goodbye and move on down here to God's own country where the grass grows tall
and the wind blows free and anyone who says "income tax" gets his mouth
washed out with soap.

Subj:   New Teacher Education guidelines

  - - The original note follows - -

From: Chris.Bigum@deakin.OZ.AU

A recent posting brought the following to mind:

The following is taken from Curriculum Guidelines for Accreditation of
Educational Conveying and Transport Technology Programs, Jan., 1992, p. 97-98.
It is in the context of foundation standards, which are prerequisite
to Automobile/Technology Literacy Endorsement, and to the Educational
Conveying and Transport Technology Leadership Masters Program.

 "....All candidates seeking initial certification or endorsements in
 Teacher Preparation should receive foundations that prepare them to:

 1. demonstrate ability to operate a horseless carriage system in order to
    successfully utilize appropriate tracks, roads and highways.

 2. evaluate and use automobiles and related technologies to support
    the travelling process.

 3. apply current engineering principles, research, and appropriate
    assessment practices to the use of cars, trucks and related technologies.

 4. explore, evaluate, and use automobile/technology-based materials,
    including travel applications, public transport systems and associated
    documentation (maps).

 5. demonstrate knowledge of uses of cars for travel problem solving, people
    collection, fuel management, communications, presentations,
    and decision-making.

 6. design and develop student learning activities that integrate driving
    and technology for a variety of student grouping strategies and for
    diverse student populations.

 7. evaluate, select and integrate automobile/tecnology-based instruction in
    the curriculum of one's subject area(s) and/or grade levels.

 8. demonstrate knowledge of uses of multimode transportation, hypertravel,
and telecommunications to support transportation.

 9. demonstrate skill in using fuel economy tools for professional and
    personal use, including tyre processing, map reading, fuel calculating,
and spray painting utilities.

 10. demonstrate knowledge of equity, ethical, legal and human issues of
    driving and transport technology use as they relate to society and model
    appropriate behaviors.

 11. identify resources for studying current applicatins of driving
    and related transport technologies in education.

 12. use transport-based technologies to access food supplies to enhance
    personal and professional productivity.

 13. apply cars and related transport technologies to facilitate emerging
    roles of the learner driver.

 ...Standards in Specialty Content include studies of or experiences with:

 1) general concepts and skills, i.e., uses of automobiles in society,
    terminology, historical developments, social and ethical concerns,
    equity issues, professional development opportunities, student support
    activities, and the teaching of driving skills;

 2) car maintenance and problem solving;

 3) application tools;

 4) food access and delivery systems;

 5) duco/furnishings selection, installation, and maintenance; and

 6) professional teaching preparation including knowledge of and
    experience with teaching methodologies relating specifically to
    instruction about automobiles and related transport technologies."

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It is likely that changes, perhaps substantial, will occur to the above as the
world's transport technology evolves.

    Critic John Clute reviewing a negative review ("Snobbery Seasoned with
    Bile, Clute Is", by Robert Latham) of his collection of reviews,
    "Strokes":

    "As misprisions go, this seems fair enough. It is a sustainable reading
    of 'Strokes'. In accomplishing this dismantling, Latham is, after all,
    performing the critic's task: that of unmasking the being of the book,
    re-creating that being, freeing the book from the author of the book.
    Because the author's claim that s/he has any final authority is a
    deficient claim; when it is allowed, a false privilege is greated. The
    author's true privilege is to be misunderstood (how many of us get the
    chance?) and the critic's true function is to make misunderstanding
    into a door of perception. With Latham's help, I open the door. I see
    how the book can be seen. There's some f2king going on, but that's
    life. And I can see that, in turn, I shape the books I review into
    monsters their parents might well weep to recognize. Those monsters, I
    know, wear my face. I give them my disease. Reviewing is rape. In the
    end, all we can do is beg forgiveness."

I am the very model of a modern Klingon General

I've taken slaves in battle and I've fought the fight victorious
I've fricassied a Vulcan and the taste was meritorious
I'm also quite familiar, too, with matters fratricidical
I disemboweled by brother for his notions patricidical
Our bloodlines are corrupted and we worship their anomaly...
I fertilized my sister just to keep it in the family!
My recipe for slaughter is a vision mathematical
I'm flatulent in airlocks with results quite aromatical
I've executed vegetable and animal and mineral
I am the very model of a modern Klingon General.

Reply-To: an288@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Mark Hittinger)

For some time now I've been puzzled by the named "Windows/NT" and how it
was derived.

Oh I know that supposedly it stands for "new technology".

Recently a new conspiracy theory was brought to my attention.  Do you remember
the mess with the choice of "HAL" in the movie 2001?  If you incremented each
letter forward one you came up with "IBM".  Of course they denied everything.

Well someone pointed out today that if you took "VMS" and incremented each
letter forward by one you get "WNT".

Chalk one up for Dave Cutler.  I hate to blow the cover on this one so early.
I'm certain that everyone involved will deny this and claim this is just a
coincidence.

This is why the Unix guys all hate it so much.  Clearly their subconscious
is flashing alarm signals at them, but they don't really understand why.
Well now you know.

And I thought they just wanted to dump out corrupted superblocks and inodes
for the rest of their lives.

A guy was happily working at his 'personal productivity station' while on
one of those business trips for which he was picking up all the frequent
flier miles, when the pilot comes in over the intercom: "It's a great day
for flying. From here to our destination the skies are CLEAR, CLEAR, CLEAR!"
The distraught passenger notices that the screen has gone blank, but with a

During one particularly vitriolic flame war about
the uselessness of documentation, I wrote the following
proposal.  I never posted it, because I am a coward.
I finally post it here, for your edification.
---------------------------------------------------

Subject:  UNIX ohne Worter

Well!  I've been completely convinced by the arguments
presented here on the uselessness of documentation.  In
fact, I've become convinced that documentation is a drug,
and that my dependence on it is artificial.  I can overcome
my addiction, with professional help.

And what's more, I feel morally obliged to cease peddling
this useless drug for a living.  I've decided to go back to
math grad school to reeducate myself, and get out of this
parasitic profession.

Perhaps it just reveals the depth of my addiction to documentation,
but I do see the need for SGI to ship *one* document with [our
next release].  I see this book as transitional only.  We can
eliminate it for [the following release].

Here's my proposal:

----------

TITLE:     "UNIX without Words"

AUDIENCE:  The UNIX novice.

OVERVIEW:  Gives a general strategy for approaching UNIX
           without documentation.  Presents generalizable
           principles useful for deciphering any operating
           system without the crutch of documentation.

CONTENTS:

INTRO:     overview of the 'no doc' philosophy
           why manuals are evil
           why man pages are evil
           why you should read this book despite the above
           "this is the last manual you'll EVER read!"

CHAP 1:    guessing which commands are likely to exist

CHAP 2:    guessing what they're likely to be called
               unpredictable acronyms the UNIX way
                   usage scenario: "grep"

CHAP 3:    guessing what options they might take
               deciphering cryptic usage messages
                   usage scenario: "tar"
               guessing when order is important
                   usage scenario: SYSV "find"

CHAP 4:    figuring out when it worked: silence on success
           recovering from errors

CHAP 5:    the oral tradition: your friend

CHAP 6:    obtaining &amp; maintaining a personal UNIX guru
           feeding your guru
           keeping your guru happy
                the importance of full news feeds
                why your guru needs the fastest/whizziest machine available
                free Coke: the elixir of your guru's life
           maintaining your guru's health
                when DO they sleep?

CHAP 7:    troubleshooting: when your guru won't speak to you
           identifying stupid questions
           safely asking stupid questions

CHAP 8:    accepting your stress
           coping with failure

----------

Now that I think about it, maybe only chapters 6 &amp; 7 are
really necessary.  Yeah, that's the ticket: we'll call it
"The UNIX Guru Maintenance Manual."

On about June 3 I received a postcard from the US Postal Service informing me
that if I used their services to deliver my Mothers' Day gift I could be
confident that it would arrive on time, May 10.  Pretty slick advertising
stunt, huh?

This year I used my own facilities and equipment to deliver my Mothers' Day
gift, a home-cooked meal.  This is a trend with which the Postal Service ought
to be concerned.

Or maybe it was just a bad case of gender confusion.  The timing was about
right for Fathers' Day.

-  Gore, Ford, Sarbanes and Simons introduce Senate verions of GPO WINDO.

-  Name of bill is changed to GPO Gateway to Government

-  Fiscal note is $3 million in fy 93, $10 million in fy 94.

On June 4, 1992 Senators Gore, Ford, Sarbanes and Simons introduced
S. 2813, the GPO Gateway to Government.  The text of the bill was
printed on page S. 7599 of the Congressional Record.  The bill, which
I haven't seen yet, is reportedly very similiar to Rose's hr 2772.

All four cosponors are democrats.  It was a pleasant surprise that
Senator Ford, who chairs the Senate Rules Committee (where the
bill is referred) was among the sponors.  Unfortunately, Senator
Stevens (R-AK) was not among the originial cosponors.

As readers of this list may know, the GPO WINDO (HR 2772) and
the GPO Gateway to Government (S 2813) would provide one-stop-
shopping online access to federal government databases and
and information systems.  The service would be free to 1,400
federal depository libraries and available for subscriptions
in homes and offices, priced at the incremental cost of
disseminating the information.  The service would be available
through the internet and over ordinary telephone lines using
a modem.  For more information, contact Anne Heanue, American

Committee on Printing 202/224-5953; or James Love, Taxpayer

        I came across this in a notesfile somewhere:

        "There are three things which are real:  God, human folly, and
        laughter.  Since the first two pass our comprehension, we must do
        what we can with the third." -- Aubrey Menen, The Ramayana

        Even though I carelessly discarded 6000 lines worth of gems last
        time (modulo probably 1500 lines of Usenet headers and trailers,
        forward-trails, and so forth), I still have 5200 lines worth of
        other stuff that at one time I apparently thought worth saving.
        Some of it sneaked in already.  It wouldn't kill me if you sent
        me something again if you fear that I'm in danger of erring badly
        by not printing something you had sent me, but never saw in
        Desperado.  I still might not print it, but that's show business.

        Nobody asked, but today's title quote comes from a Led Zep parody
        done by the Pyjama Slave Dancers.  The bit about the catfish's
        sweet little grin in 3063 was from Danny O'Keefe.

        And if I catch that slabfaced, pignosed son of a quail anywhere
        near Murphy and her kid, I'm zapping his limo with my rader detector.
