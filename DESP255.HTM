Shouldn't it be Scaramouche instead of Desperado?  (given where the
first quotation comes from)

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
 Rafael Sabatini's "Scaramouche" it is.  The quotation appears over
 the doors of the Yale Drama School.  Steal only the best.  I'm not
 sure where I stole this next one, probably off risks.

Subject: Risks of hot lines

At our old building, we had a non-PBX line into the computer room.  It
was hooked to a Radio Shack environmental monitor, which would detect
high temp, noise, etc. and call a list of phone numbers until someone
responded.  That part worked fine.  But we started getting wrong numbers
-- we'd be in the room and hear the phone ring, and the robot would pick
up and start talking, but nobody who worked there would own up to it.
This happened several times per day -- too many even for telemarketing
-- and we couldn't figure it out for the longest time.  Then one day I
was driving home and heard an ad on the radio for a suicide hotline, in
nearby Maryland -- at number (301) 605-0525.  Our robot's line was
(703) 605-0525!  So some poor depressed person would get it together
enough to call the number, but without the 301, and would get a robot
saying "This is telephone number 6 8 5 0 5 2 5, the time is xx:yy,
temperature is OK, noise level is OK, alert 1 is OK, alert 2 is OK,
listen to the surrounding area for 15 seconds", after which it would
switch on a microphone so they could either uninterrupted hear machine
room noise or machine room noise with people saying "Hey, the robot's
talking" "Yeah, it does that" "Wow, weird" and the like.

I shudder to think of whether there were any lasting ill effects of this
problem.  The good news is that shortly after discovering it, we moved to a
new building with a new number.

 It's Rock&amp;Roll Hall Fame time again:

        Led Zeppelin

 What grates more than the voice and view of Robert Plant that?
 "Stairway  to Heaven" is a brilliant concoction that expresses the
 hopes and dreams of teenage dope-smoking American males that they
 would someday meet that strangely beautiful and silent maiden who
 rises out of the misty waters to fulfill them physically and
 spiritually before sinking once again beneath the surface.

 Perhaps the strangest fact about Led Zeppelin is that it took Willie
 Dixon ten years to find out that these creepy Brits had stolen his
 lemon-squeezer song.  Lots of people knew it.  Was there no one who
 knew Willie Dixon too?  Where was Marshall Chess for one?

 Aside from that, sometimes a truly hot band.  "Rock&amp;Roll" pardons a
 lot of their sins.  And I'll love Robert Plant forever for
 mentioning "the unjustly maligned and tragically overlooked Moby
 Grape" as one of his inspirations.

 Jimmy Page was a true guitar god, pointing out that this was his
 second induction to the hall, him being a Yardbird.  He jammed poor
 Steven Tyler right into the ground in their jam session, then went
 into an amazing toe-to-toe shootout with Neil Young, before jovially
 allowing Robert Plant to demonstrate that at least he sings better
 than he plays guitar.

 Neil Young

 Neil Young once said he couldn't know whether people really liked him
 or if they were just dazzled by the success of his music.  I like
 him.  I like it that he refused to stay "Neil Young", but went off in
 many directions, disco, electro, rockabilly, trying on many hats. I like
 it that he always went back to Crazy Horse every few albums or tours.
 I like it that he was the main inspiration for Dinosaur Jr., one of
 my current faves.  I like it that he fell in love with "Sweet Home
 Alabama" after hearing no more than half a chorus and liked it even
 better when he figured out it was an attack on him and "Southern Man".
 I like it that he not only built his quadriplegic son a
 servo-controlled model railroad, but also convinced Lionel to
 manufacture it as a product for other paralyzed children.  I
 once identified him after about three sentences of a radio interview
 just from his shining intelligence and integrity.  So I like him a
 lot.  He is a bastard of a guitar player.  The only thing I don't
 like is his singing and his songs.  But he may be the best person
 in the Hall of Fame.

 Al Green

 A pure voice and a good career.  Funny about all those covers of
 "Take Me to the River".

 Martha and the Vandellas

 The best quality Motown product.

 Janis Joplin

 One hit and a great live act are all it takes to get into the Hall
 of Fame, but a great life helps.  People sure loved her.  I loved
 her. But she screeched.  Big Brother was an awful band.  Big Maybelle
 and Etta James had lives too and control of their pipes.  I think
 everybody ought to be in the Rock&amp;Roll Hall of Fame.  If they played
 rock&amp;roll and they were ever famous, put 'em in there.

 The Orioles

 Legendary yes, and Sonny Til had a voice to make you forget Robert
 Plant is also called a tenor, but they're in the Hall more for having
 having had the first big national breakout record from an
 independent record company with the still dreamy "It's too soon to
 know".  Virtually every harmony group that followed took a bird name
 They were known collectively as bird groups, but as for me put the
 Spiders in there and let's have some rock&amp;roll.

 Allman Brothers

 Before their success, they had a band called Hourglass.  I saw them
 in St. Louis on one of those ten-act bills they used to have and
 they blew me away, maybe because I was a Georgia boy and they were
 playing Georgia Boy music, although I didn't know it at the time.
 Duane Allman was famous before anybody'd ever heard his name as
 the guitar player on Wilson Pickett's version of "Hey Jude".  Theirs
 is another great story, their survival of the loss of Duane and their
 enduring love for him.  They shone on that stage in St. Louis before
 any of that happened.

 Frank Zappa

 Zappa used to do a ferocious "Tie me to the whipping post" as an
 encore.  One of my top five musical experiences was a spontaneous
 jam between the Mothers of Invention (Jimmy Carl Black and all) and
 Rahsahn Roland Kirk.  Kirk preceded the Mothers at the Boston Globe
 Jazz festival but came back out when he heard the Mothers start
 their tuneup schtick.  So this unparalleled pairing of progressive
 musician jammed on "Okie Dokie Stomp" and "All Night Long", 1950's
 hard-rocking honking and squeaking saxes and driving Southwestern
 guitars.  Zappa was a smart man and a great musician with a lot to
 say, but his song lyrics were warmed-over surrealism.   But he does
 raise the tone of the Hall a notch, like Lou Reed said.  Scenes at a
 Mother's show: the only two weirdos from Washington Courthouse, Ohio,
 run into each at the door.  Repeated for every small town in America.

 And it's a tip o'the Desperado sombrero to Mark Schorr for rescuing a
 set of all available issues of this historic e-rag their author -
 c'est moi - had managed to lose everything except the precious list itself
 in his hasty departure.  They now occupy 6 meg of my hard drive and
 will someday reappear on the Desperado Home Page (which does not yet
 exist, I hasten to add).  Those lucky enough still to be on the
 easynet can perhaps still find these archives at the notesfile
 DECWEST::DESPERADO.  Someone wrote me and signed off "Still at
 Digital, no longer at DEC".  I also saw the p-name "Outsourcing?
 We'll manage." which all will understand.  It is in this spirit that I
 reveal the location of the secret archives.

I'm not sure it's entirely congruent with your particular
iconoclasm, but for what it's worth, here's a little song lyric
that may or may not interest you (I have a 40 minute commute
and sometimes make up little songs.  You'll recognize the
intended melody for this one.)

            Making light of dark matter

            Oh, dear, where can the matter be?
            Can't find the mass to account for the gravity
            keeping continuum's curvature unity --
            where can the dark matter be?

            Oh, dear, what can the matter be?
            Can't be just atoms and scattered old star debris,
            that stuff shows up in absorption spectroscopy --
            what can that strange matter be?

            Oh, dear, why must the matter be?
            Just to keep faith in the Big Bang catastrophe,
            latter day guise of Augustine cosmology.
            Fiat!  The matter must be.

 I loved "Picnic", was that yours?  Yes, I do like you better than the
 others and I tell all corporations to think of Western Washington
 when making their gift-giving plans, but the reason you and 1200-plus
 people got two copies of my test message is that I am an idiot.  Only
 the reptile brain saved me by causing my fingers to make a one-word
 change in the two messages.  Still, I got two errors returned for
 every error in the list (400-plus) and all these inquiries.  It's
 taken me till now to clear the list enough to feel safe sending
 another mailing, which this is.
