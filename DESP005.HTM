Okay, Desperados, another literary opportunity.  Everybody passed this
contest up before, so I'm repeating it.  The idea is to make a list of
sentences that are never true, though often said.

        For a forthcoming compendium of "Lines never to be believed",
author requests quotations of the form:

        "The check is in the mail"

        "I'm from the government, trust me"

        "Don't worry, I've already had a vasectomy"

Subject: Two tidbits.....

My manager got a memo today from someone who purports to be a senior
marketing specialist in a group called Digital Computer Supplies, trying
to sell these fancy brochures telling customers how wonderful all the
latest versions of RSX and VMS are.  The memo included the following
statistics:

"In FY82, approximately 15,500 RSX and 30,400 VAX/VMS systems were
installed."

If that last figure is correct (it is copied correctly, anyway), and
the average selling price for a VAX system is $100,000, then Digital
received over $3 billion in revenue from VAX systems along!  We must
have give away free all those RSX licenses.

What bothers me is that some marketing specialist didn't check
his figures.  It should have been obvious that there are not 30,000
VMS systems out there, since we've only built about 6000 VAXs over the life
of the product.

That this memo went to nearly everyone who gets Sales Update is the problem.
I'd be willing to bet that that 30,000 figure even makes it into the
trade literature at some point.

Secondly, I received a memo from the 25th Anniversary Committee telling
me where and when I can get a free lunch, and pick up my "momento of
the day".  Every instance of the word "momento" was spelled wrong.

My manager's comment:  "A company with 67,000 employees, and 33,500 of
them are below average!"

I have a different question to ask.  If the IBM 360 was supposed to

"beyond full-circle" computing, what are the 350 and 325 supposed to
represent?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
As my old history professor used to say, "If people can't disagree
about something, they'll disagree about something else."  The issue,
perhaps somewhat artificial, is "Do you enjoy the foliage more or
less if you understand what's going on?"

I might add that while we have many nearly congruent explanations of
the mechanism of fall colors, no one has come up with the *function*
of fall colors.  Flowers are pretty because bees like pretty flowers
and plants need bees to survive.  Maybe trees need to have people
looking at them and saying "That sure is pretty!"

By the way, the NH and VT people who profit from the tourists driving
up to see the fall colors universally refer to the phenomenon as "the
foilage".

When the answers to the questions about the leaves all arrive, and
they all will be very technical I'm sure, I doubt that any will answer
the question in a fundamental way.  Oh, you'll get answers about
chlorophyll, and enzymes, and sugar, and starch, and light
reflectivity, and the absence of green dye, and frost, and decreased
daylight, and lessened moisture, etc., blah, blah.

Terrific.  Wonderful.  But why do leaves change color?

You see, that's like the question, "How do you walk?"  To that
question you'll get stuff about will and muscle response and synapses
and electrochemical-neural discharge and etc., blah, blah.  Oh, by the
way, if you use "will," you will have to explain what that means.

Wonderful stuff.  But how do you walk?  You are not aware of all those
complicated microscopic events that go on, yet you do it and you don't
know how.  You just walk, and very well too.  And you cannot explain,
nor can anyone, how you walk.  It's very simple. Fine. Tell me how you
walk.

Here's another one.  Tell me how to ride a bike.  I already know how.
How do I know how?  I can get on a bike and go from point A to point B
and not fall down.  That is the experiential way that I know how to
ride a bike.  I cannot tell anyone how, and I can ride a bike.  So, by
knowing how, I mean I can do it, not write it down.

Conceptualized experience determines the nature of the experience,
the experience reinforces the concept, the concept then in turn
further determines the experience, etc, etc, until the experience does
not contain any reality at all; it's just another concept.  Most
people do not make the distinction between a concept of something and
the actual experience of it.  That is really too bad, because what
happens is that they do not really EXPERIENCE anything. Conceptualized
experience--BAH!

Do it.  Experience it.  Smell leaves, kick them, roll in them, throw
them around, listen to them, love their colors.

Walk on streets, in the woods, in water.  Feel it.  Notice the way
your legs move and how the muscles pull, notice the way the bones in
your feet spread and the muscles pull them together.  Actually
experience walking...enjoy it.

Ride a bike.  Notice your cold nose.  Hear the rushing wind.  Notice
your heavy breathing and the tension in your arms and legs.

Figure out machines; EXPERIENCE LIFE.

Does not LIFE work?  Are not machines part of it?  Is a tree not a
machine?  Are not investigation and understanding ways to experience?

Judging from the mail from Desperados, I must conclude, as I long
suspected that science teachers just stand up there and wing it, telling
their pupils whatever they learned at their mothers' knees, in the
Farmer's Almanac, and in Boy's Life. Just to mix it up further, MY
eight-grade science teacher said that the stimulus for color changes
in leaves is the reduced daylight that obtains in the fall. This seems
to contradict much of what people are saying about cold weather, etc.

I can certainly believe what someone said about chlorophyll masking the
bright colors. It absorbs enormous amounts of energy in the red-yellow
part of the spectrum (so much that it fluoresces in the infrared region).
Chlorophyll is, after all, designed to do so, since it's part of feeding
Mr. Tree. The various colors arise for several chemical reasons, including
the presence of sugars, the partial conversion of chlorophyll to other
pigments, and the loss of chlorophyll from the leaf.

If you boil a leaf in methyl alcohol, you'll soon have a leaf that closely
resembles the crinkly autumn-woods kind and a beaker of green methyl
alcohol, that is, if you don't set your kitchen on fire first.

This is not to suggest that you shouldn't, instead, do as My Man George
suggested and just walk around the woods grooving on nature.

P.S. I bet that George shoots small, helpless animals while walking
in said autumn woods.

I think I detected some knee-jerk anti-intellectualism in the piece on
enjoying the leaves without understanding them.  I fully agree that
people may be robbing themselves of the innocent pleasure of the
New England fall, but it is not because they are interested in understanding
why leaves turn color.  It is because they feel guilty that, in spite
of all the world problems and economic woes, they are enjoying simple
pleasures just like a child.  Single-minded attention to responsibility
is a clever way to mask guilt.

I've always found that a scientific understanding of some natural phenomenon
enables me to enjoy it more fully.  This is particularly true as far as
the human mind and body are concerned.  If you want to be fascinated with
yourself, just take a course in molecular biology with emphasis on DNA
and reproduction.  Wow!  Who the hell figured out that system?

Go home this weekend and enjoy the leaves.  To hell with all the work you
have to do around the house -- it won't make any difference in the long
run anyway.  You're only doing it so that you won't have to experience.

The "Ruth" referred to below is in the Bible, and has one of its books
named after her.  She ended up a long way from home, "amid the alien
corn".

One doesn't make Indian corn; one grows it. "Corn" is a generic term for grain
(wheat, rye, barley, etc.). The English settlers in America coined "Indian
corn"as the name of what we Americans now call, simply, corn (as that TV
commercial insists on telling you, "We call it maize": Mazola, I think it is).
I mean, isn't it odd to picture Ruth, amidst the alien fields of corn? Like
the turkey, corn (in the American sense) was unknown outside North America.
Ever wonder why such a strange bird was named after a country?

Subject: Autumn leaves and indian corn

Most of the pigments in plants are caused by porphyrins, not sugars.
Chlorophyll is one example.  In a living leaf, it is the dominant pigment.
Hence, most leaves appear to be a shade of green.  In autumn, leaves stop
producing chlorophyll and the other pigments.  Finally, the leaves die
altogher and fall off the plant.  Leaves cease production of different pigments
at different times.  Chlorophyll is one of the first to go, which is why we
get to see some of the other colors, mainly yellows and reds.  When the leaf
dies, the leaf tissues oxidize and turn brown.  This conceals the remaining
pigments.  Multi-color leaves happen when one area of the leaf gets ahead of
other areas in the dying process.

Indian corn, or wild maize, has different colored kernels because the various
kernels have different genotypes.  Standard (I hesitate to say garden-variety)
corn is a carefully bred hybrid.  All of the kernels were fertilized by pollen
from the same variety of corn, and therefore they all look the same.  Breeding
of wild maize is unchaperoned, and so you can get all kinds of genetic makeup.
The situation is similar to breeding cats.  Kittens in a litter from a
pedigreed persian all look alike.  An alley cat's kittens usually are a mixed
lot.
