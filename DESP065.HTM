Subject: Comet Alert. Can you send this one out special today?

The following article appeared in the New York Times for Sunday, May 8. It is
signed by K. L. Franklin, an astronomer at the Hayden Planetarium.

   "There is news in the night sky this week. A comet never before seen
   by man is rushing toward the Earth for this planet's closest en-
   counter with a comet in two centuries. The best viewing times are
   expected to be Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings. Binoculars
   are prefereble to a home telescope for viewing the comet, which will
   probably be difficult to see with the unaided eye. It will appear as
   a fuzzy patch of diffuse light.

   "The comet is called IRAS-Araki-Alcock in honor of its discoverers, a
   satellite and two amateur astronomers. It is expected to come within
   2.9 million miles of Earth Wednesday. Only [comet] Lexall in 1770 is
   known to have come closer."

The article is accompanied by a star map showing the path of the comet. It
should be easy to find, even for someone who does not know the stars well.

  - At 11:00 tonight (Monday), the comet should be directly inside the bowl
    of the Little Dipper in the northern sky.

  - Tuesday night at 11:00 it will form a near-equalilateral triangle with
    the "pointer stars" of the Big Dipper -- the two stars that point at
    the North Star.

  - Wednesday night at 11:00 it will be smack in the middle of the constel-
    lation Cancer.

The comet will be moving across the sky with approximately the speed of the
Moon, about a degree an hour. Its movement would be perceptible in a tele-
scope, but probably not in binoculars.
