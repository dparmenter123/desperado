A recent mail message from our esteemed publisher ran the SUBJ: "I'm in
Florida. And you're not." Well, one of the reasons you weren't
enjoying all this a week or more ago is that my dear husband and I
just spent seven glorious nights and six sunny days on the island of
Montserrat in the Irish Caribbean. I could tell you all about the warm
winds, the fragrant flowers, the colorful birds, the exhilarating
surf, the sailing, the steel bands, the volcanoes, but no. I don't
want to start a riot. I'll just start off with some practical advice.

================================================================================
Note 173.0                 Finnish Winter behaviour                   No replies
ECCGY4::JAERVINEN "Emmanuel Kant, but Genghis Khan"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following appeared in 'Suomen Kuvalehti', issue 39, 26-Sep-1986.
    The author is Neil Hardwick, an Englishman living in Finland.
    Reproduced here without permission. Enjoy!

    Readers are asked to note that Winter Behaviour comes into force
in Finland on October 1st, i.e. next Wednesday. From that day
forward the following rules, regulations and conventions are to be
observed.

  Cheerful banter with shop assistants and waiters shall cease
forthwith. If silence cannot be maintained, surly bad temper is
recommended for both parties. It is especially to be borne in mind that,
in all establishments where intoxicating liquors are served, the
customer is sometimes RIGHT in the period May-September, but ALWAYS
WRONG during the period October-April.

  It is not permissible to smile at people in the street, even if they
smile at you first. Casual good humour may give offence, and is always
liable to misunderstanding. In the event of accidental eye-contact, DO
NOT PANIC! Continue as if nothing had happened and move away. If this
is not possible, for example at a bus stop, stare hard at something
else, e.g., the time-table, an advertisement hoarding, a nearby parked
car (assuming of course there is no one in it). If the eye contact
continues and appears deliberate, inform the police.

  Recommended colours for clothing are grey, black and anaemic shades
of blue. Brighter colours are permitted for children and in plastic
raincoats (women only).

  Upon dialling a wrong telephone number, the summer practice of
apologizing for one's mistake ceases. Winter Practice is to maintain
silence for a short period and then replace the receiver.

  The background music for television advertisements shall consist of
cellos playing slow melodies in a minor key. Chirpy tunes on the
accordion are banned (thank God).

  Drunks are no longer to be humored.

  Special regulations for public transport:

  It is forbidden to sing, whistle, hum, fidget or talk (except to
oneself in a low mutter).

  Passengers seated next to a window shall stare out of it, whether the
vehicle be in motion or not.

  Passengers seated next to the gangway are permitted to look forwards,
provided they take due care not to focus their eyes on other
passengers. The seats near the doors are reserved for drunks.

  Special caution is required when attempting to leave a window seat.
There may be someone sitting between you and the gangway. Do NOT
attempt to speak to this person. Simply squeeze past in silence, taking
care to inflict as little physical damage as possible.

EXCEPTIONS:

  The only exception to these rules are the pre-Christmas parties known
as Pikkujoulut, at which jollity is COMPULSORY.

  These regulations are in operation until April 30th 1987, upon which
date Summer Behaviour comes into force once more.

Subj:   Only the Herald would find a story like this

        A Hyannis woman who used a soup ladle to dig out from under
        five-foot snowdrifts left by Monday's blizzard is cringing
        at news of another snowstorm set to hit Friday.

        "I hope we don't get any more snow.  I've had enough to last
        me all winter, " said Helen Storey, who used a soup ladle to
        get out of her home after snowdrifts sealed her front door
        from the outside world.

        "I though about jumping out my second story window into the
        snowdrifts, but I thought I'd get buried alive," said the
        51-year-old physical education teacher at Barnstable High
        School.

        "I got the ladle from my kitchen and started scooping the
        snow away bit by bit," she said.

Subj:   A little ditty to be sung in a stupid voice.

This is a little tune my roommate and I came up with.  He dreamed up
the first half while doing his laundry around the corner from
our apartment at school.  I enjoyed it and dreamed
up the second half while sitting on the
toilet in same apartment.  None
of our roommates were
impressed enough
to add to it.

Strange.

                When you see a string of dashes, hold that note and
                        drag the word out.  This is good advice
                        for all areas of life, by the way.}

Subj:   Just another snake cult

The Globe the other day ran a short piece about Art Buchwald being the
guest speaker at a citizenship ceremony in a federal district court.
Buchwald cracked jokes about Ronald Reagan to prove to the new US
citzens that in this country it is possible to make fun of the
president and other leaders without fear of arrest. For example:

    When did the president know what was going on -- and when did he
    forget it?

    What is the definition of a moderate Iranian? A moderate Iranian is
    one who has run out of ammunition.

    Have you heard that President Reagan has lost many sleepless
    days over the Middle East?

And a non-Reagan joke:

    A man looked to the heavens and said, "God, please let me
    win the lottery.  What do you have to lose if I win the lottery?"
    The next day the man looked in the newspaper and his name wasn't
    there.  He got down on his knees and said, "Please, God, I've
    been a good husband, a good father. I've never hurt anyone
    in my life.  Please let me win the lottery."  And this deep
    voice came out of the heavens and said, "Do me a favor --
    buy a ticket."

Today's Globe has a story about a guy collecting Ohio jokes for
Michiganers and Michigan jokes for Ohioans.  Most are variations on
ethnic jokes, but here is one -- Ken Alden please take note:

    It was the Ohio State-Michigan game and every seat in the stadium
    was filled -- except one.  The man sitting next to the empty seat
    was asked about it by the man seated behind him. "My wife and I
    used to come to the games for years," the man near the empty seat
    said, "but she passed away."  Noting that the ticket was tough to
    get, the other man asked, "Couldn't you have brought someone else
    to enjoy the game? A friend or a relative?"  "I would have," the
    man said, "but they're all at her funeral."

Another Arnold Schwarzennegger movie line.  (You may recall that in
Conan the Barbarian, someone says, upon being told about some bad
guys, "A few months ago they were just another snake cult. Now they're
everywhere.")  In Raw Deal, Arnold is a disgraced G-man, working as a
small-town sheriff.  He comes home to find his wife drunk again and
baking a cake.  She hates living in the boonies.  She gets mad
and hurls the cake at him.  Arnold dodges it and says, deadpan,
"You should not drink and bake."

OK. I guess you had to be there.

The Song of the Shirt

I'm going back to work in the mill
in a pair of Levis and a shirt
hand-sewn in Oregon.
But the mill is the mill of the mind
where the neurons fire
and we aspire
to make waves that are softer still.

The hand-sewn shirt is without the mill
but despite the recent demise
of the loom-room, the work
goes on.  And the pixels of cloth
that come from Oxford town
and the literals of cotton twill
line up a form that returns a nil.

But the mill of the mind is with us still.
With possiblities more numerous
than cotton shirts.
Unlimited as the data
that marches across a page,
or a bow that cuts across
 a New Zealand wave.

&gt; One wonders what the Prince of Wales would have to say about all this. He was
&gt; the one who came up with the idea of the 12-metre yacht when he found that
&gt; the private fortune of the Saxe-Coburgs couldn't compete with the public
&gt; funds of Germany that Kaiser Wilhelm was using to buy boats that would whip
&gt; the crown off the P. of W.

And I wonder whatever happened to sailing!
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

And I wonder to which Prince of Wales you refer?  Presumably not the present
one.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Why, Bertie, le Prince de Galles, naturellement. The one who was coeval with
Kaiser Wilhelm. The one whose little love nest with Lillie Langtry bore
the following legend over the fire place: "They say. What say they? Let
them say." The one who turned into Edward VII for a few short years and
then joined the choir invisible to chuck actresses under the chin
for all eternity.

        Coca-Cola has changed the name of its soft drink in China,

Several other people posted notes in French.  Eventually, the moderator

he'd purge the note.  This reply was then posted:

And why not? I am not going to include the REAL translation, which
might find its way into the Wrong Hands. But it does remind me of a
similar situation in which my dear friend Amanda once found herself.
Fresh out of college with a Russian major to her credit, she
went to a cocktail party given by friends of her parents. A
not terribly bright matron was gushing over Amanda's linguistic
accomplishments and demanding an example. Amanda blithely reeled
off something along the lines of "I have the pen of the gardener's
aunt. Have you the coach of the countess?" Dim matron of course
was terribly impressed and asked for a translation. Amanda said
tactfully, "Oh, I just counted from one to ten and said 'Good morning'".
To which the matron's dashing brother replied softly, in Russian,
"Little liar."

       Healthy Code...

       Announcing two new add on products for BASIC development.  The
       first is "Abysmal Coding Interface Done In C" or ACIDIC. After
       processing the source, the output appears as SALT or "Sure Ain't
       Like Tex".  This meta-code is understandable by no known, working
       compiler, ensuring a SALT free diet for your system (i.e.
       the Pritikin Shell).

       Since neither of these products serve a useful purpose (other
       than making sure no BASIC code runs on your system), Marketing
       will depend heavily on them for their FY'87 revenues.

In a nationwide publicity campaign this famous New York Jeweler is
offering these fabulous simulated diamonds for the unheard of price of
$19.95!

Everyone has seen these ads.  Have you read them?  The offer
everything from the above-mentioned diamonds to.... chronometers,
fleecy pile-lined genuine suede moccasins, 1000-piece tackle sets,
clown dolls, etc.  These are not -- it seems -- all from the same
company (though many, many are) but they all use the same advertising
gimmics.  This is not to say that they are dishonest.  But they *are*
funny.

The real scream are the features.  These from a diver watch: "Zero

Subj:   Skip the whales; save the fools.

   RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) - A 24-year-old man who says he
has long dreamed of riding whales faces charges along with a friend
after making the dream come true on the backs of killer whales at
Marineland aquatic park.
   Dave Mulligan and David Berg, 25, of Rolling Hills Estates, were
booked for investigation of trespassing after guards caught them
fully clothed and in neckties and penny loafers, whale riding at
2:40 a.m. Saturday, Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Robert Reedy
said Tuesday.
   ``Hey, it's been a fantasy of mine ever since I was a kid,''
said Mulligan, who has lived on the bluffs above Marineland for 17
years. ``I love whales. You can see them from our house.''
   He said the ride was great.
   ``I was leaning back on the dorsal fin,'' he said Monday. ``Then
we were standing on the whales and surfing. I don't think we would
have gotten caught, but my buddy was getting pretty loud. It was so
much fun it was hard not to laugh out loud.''
   Mulligan said Monday the adventure started over beers at a bar
with five pals, all named Dave. But three of the Daves balked at
whale riding and weren't around when the guards came, Mulligan said.
   ``My buddy Dave and I jumped on when Corky and Orky started
rolling over on their backs,'' Mulligan said. ``Everybody was
sober. You had to be, especially after sneaking in. You had to
maintain a low profile.''
   Reedy said the men were lucky the whales had just been fed.
   ``I think the whales were probably a little disappointed that
they swam around the tank with them and then didn't get their
mackerel...,'' the sergeant said, noting that killer whales have
been known to attack people. ``We could've had a drowned
individual.''
   The two men would have faced felony charges if the whales had
been hurt, but Marineland indicated no harm was done, Reedy said.
The men were released on their written promises to appear, but no
bail was imposed, Reedy said.
   District attorney's spokesman Al Albergate said no charges have
been filed yet. A misdemeanor trespass conviction would carry a
maximum six-month sentence and $1,000 fine, he said.
   Mulligan said he has climbed the fence many times since he was a
youth. He suggested the park tighten security to protect the
whales. The park declined comment.

Subj:   A dubious end of the year

Junk reading for the end of the year.

The three most irresistable magazine issues are the Sports Illustrated
bathing suit issue, the Car &amp; Driver ten-best-of-the-year issue, and
Esquire's annual Dubious Achievement Awards. (Local readers may want to
nominate a fourth, Boston magazine's annual Best-and-Worst, but it
tends to the realm of higher advertisting rather than the lower
criticism.)

This year is the 25th anniversary of Dubious Achievements.  From
the past, come these gems:

    "I thought that Le Duc Tho had some physical attraction for me.  He
    couldn't keep his hands off me."  -- Henry Kissinger

    "We begin bombing in five minutes."  -- Ronald Reagan

    "The White House really badly, badly needs china." -- Nancy Reagan

    "We have every kind of mixture you can have.  I have a black, I have a
    woman, two Jews, and a cripple." -- James Watt

    "People hate me because I am a multifaceted, talented, wealthy,
    internationally famous genius." -- Jerry Lewis

And from this year, come these:

    Attorney General Meese headed a nine-member commission on pornography
    that produced a 1,960-page report and cost an estimated $400,000.

    "That'll be a tough act for Dad to follow." -- Michael Reagan, to a Los
    Angeles TV audience, on his hearing that on the day his father was to
    give the State of the Union address, the space shuttle Challenger
    exploded in flight

    "I'm a dark, dark horse." -- Alexander Haig, on his plans to seek the
    1988 Republican nomination for president

    While relighting the Statue of Liberty's torch, President Reagan
    referred to the poet who wrote the statue's dedication as "Emmett
    Lazarus."

    During a dinner cruise in New York harbor, Bob Hope told a joke about
    the Statue of Liberty having AIDS.  "Nobody knows if she got if from
    the mouth of the Hudson or the Staten Island Ferry."

    In the excitement of signing the tax-reform bill, the president wrote
    his name "Reagan Ronald."

    Gen. William C. Westmoreland, Ret., contended that the nude girl
    running down the road in the famous Vietnam photograph had been burned
    by a hibachi, not by napalm.

    For one week in September, Dan Rather ended his news broadcasts with
    the word, "Courage."

    White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan warned that imposing economic
    sanctions on South Africa would hurt the US because he doubted "the
    women of America" are "prepared to give up all their jewelry."

    "Just destroy all the tapes."  -- Richard Nixon, at a press luncheon,
    on being asked what was the greatest lesson of Watergate

    "Steven Spielberg." -- Miss Delaware, at the Miss America Pageant, on
    being asked to name her favorite author.

    The city of Hamilton, Ohio changed its name to "Hamilton!"

    "I may have said something about the NAACP being un-American or
    communist, but I meant no harm by it."  -- Jefferson Sessions,
    testifying before the Senate on his nomination for the Federal bench

    The St. Louis transit authority spent eighteen months calling its bus
    stops "bus starts," but it didn't catch on.

    Actress Mariette Hartley, on a Rona Barrett TV show (where else?), said
    that she "was celibate off and on for twelve years."

    "I probably have a more extreme reaction to being sued that some people
    had to being in Auschwitz." -- Fran Liebowitz, in an interview

    "I would have preferred another father." -- Josef Mengele's son
    Rolf, to an interviewer

    In his book The Triumph of Politics, David Stockman says that Defense
    Secretary Caspar Weinberger explained the military budget to President
    Reagan by showing him a cartoon of three soldiers in various stages
    of preparedness.
