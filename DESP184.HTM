    Starting with this issue, all Desperado issues are proofread in hard
    copy, not on the screen.  A recent issue had a serious screwup in it.
    I've apologized offline as best I could to the innocent victims of my
    carelessness and thoughtlessness.  I hope I can prevent future screwups
    by being more careful and more thoughtful.

    Another editor's note, you can renumber the last issue 2012A or 2013 or
    something 'cause I sent out two 2012's.

    With that out of the way, let the wild rumpus begin.

Here's a summary of what happened, from a friend of mine at Lotus.
I'm redistributing this without permission so I've removed the "From"
name just to be safe.  (The below-mentioned "Patrick" is a mutual
friend.)  One of us heard some coverage on WBUR radio this morning,
before the event.  I'm betting it won't make "All Things Considered".

Or, at least that is what it looked like from the sixth floor.

About 50 or so very nerdy looking guys with a variety of signs - chanting was
audible on 6.  Some cameras presumably from newspapers, no video that I could
see.  Patrick was the only "normal" or identifable person from my vantage point.

Reaction here was primarily how pathetically scruffy they looked.  A sign that
said "Nerd Power" got quite a few chuckles...

Frankly, they would have had a much better time yesterday when the weather was
fine and TONS of people were out walking on the river.  But, they seemed to be
good natured (kept waving to us) and their signs certainly showed a sense of
humor.

So, that's it on assault # 1.

   JO:This is a tangled issue.  Too bad Stallman is on a side that otherwise
      has a good deal to recommend it.

Yes, that's how I feel about it.  Some of Stallman's propaganda is
pretty good.  My favorite draws an analogy with the user interface for
cars, e.g.  the relative placements of the pedals and so forth, and
what would have happened had it been copyrighted.

This is the first time I've heard of the "League for Programming
Freedom"; I wonder if it was invented specifically for this protest.
I think it's absolutely in character for RMS to not understand why it
sounds so silly; like many a fanatic, he takes himself incredibly
seriously.

    If you work in the suburbs, you can travel back and forth and stay for
    the entire demonstration in about 2.5 hours.  That's a long lunch, but
    you can get away with it.

I just gave a final to a class at Columbia.

The real questions added up to 99 points total;
so for 1 extra point, I asked them to

State the top 10 reasons that theoretical computer science
is important in your daily life.

Here were some of the better answers (note: unfortunately, some
of the answers to the real questions were a lot more hilarious,
but propriety forbids my sharing them with you):

(1) No expensive hardware is needed.

(2) If you've got DTIME, we've got DBEER.

(3) We've got DTIME, if you've got DMONEY.

(4) I now have more acronyms to use with my IBM friends.

(5) No eye-strain is incurred from VDT's.

(6) It makes visiting the dentist enjoyable and watching grass
grow interesting.

(7) It almost makes me believe that computer science is a science.

(8) If you have a car accident and become a quadraplegic,
you can still do theoretical computer science.

(9) I have gained insight into how Fermat felt,
because I have a neat proof that P=NP, but I cannot fit
it into this blue book.

(10) Now I can b.s. my boss about why I'm not writing more code.

(11) I am convinced that the OPTIMAL MAYORAL CANDIDATE problem
is NP-complete and thus do not have to decide whom to vote for.

(12) It helps me convince people that my indecisiveness is
really Nondeterminism, which sounds like a much more
positive characteristic.

(13) It makes me realize how much computational complexity I
lost when I dropped acid.

(14) I have learned that it is possible to get a CS degree without
writing major amounts of code.

(15) (From an OR student who is trying to get a job at Bell Labs)
It makes me feel like a computer scientist.
It makes me feel more like a computer scientist.
It makes me feel more and more like a computer scientist.
It makes me feel more and more and more like a computer scientist.
..
It makes me feel (more and)^8 more like a computer scientist.

I probably decided to use this because it reminds me of the old medical
school story.

The students were asked to give three reasons why mother's milk was
superior to formula for babies.

One answer was: "1-Better control over hygenic conditions. 2-Pass
antibodies directly from mother to baby. 3-It comes in cuter containers."

    From May 1989 IEEE Computer, p.81, this extract:

    ...as an engineer (electrical) by education, I deeply resent
    the misuse of the word "engineering" in the compound term
    "software engineering."  Such misuse constitutes, in my opinion,
    a cheap, deceptive attempt to take advantage of the professional
    reputation and image developed by real engineers over a century
    or so without acquiring a comparable level of professional
    knowledge, qualification, and capability.  In short, it
    constitutes theft of professional reputation.

No doubt written by Dr. Somebody-or-other.

    That's the flaming part of the article.  You can read the rest of
    it yourself if you're interested.

        Was I the only one that called the number listed at the end
of the mouse ball alert? The person that was credited as the author
was the person who answered the phone....

        Fact or fiction?

Re the "shoulders-of-giants" quote: a notoriously witty Harvard
physicist, Sidney Coleman, explains that Newton had an ego; what he had
*meant* to say was, "If I have seen farther than others, it's because
I've been surrounded by midgets."

The Globe ran an article yesterday on the male barbecue mystique -- why
are men Kings of the Grill?  (Except at my house, but then, I'm an
exceptionally sensitive guy.)  Accompanying the article was a picture
from the Better Homes &amp; Gardens "Barbecue Book", copyright 1956.  The
snappy '50s artwork showed Dad grinning with becoming modesty as he put
the last onion on the skewer, with Mom looking on approvingly, Sis
adoringly, and Junior (in full cowboy regalia, trailed by dog) sneaking
a look, trying to learn the Grill Secrets of the Male Ancients.

The best part was the text:

"This is Dad's domain.  Sit back, Mom;  admire Chef.  He has the
fascinating how-to on big steaks, other juicy meats that take to
charcoal.  There's rotisserie roasting, cooking on skewers, grilling
whole meats in foil;  plus how-to-talk-knowingly with the meatman."

                                    xxx

And I'm sure we all will.  Have a happy holiday.
