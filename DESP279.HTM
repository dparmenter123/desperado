Here's the open letter published in an Australian newspaper:

    An open letter to M. Jacques Chirac:

    Mon cher Jack

    Je suis a bit fromaged off avec votre decision to blow up La
    Pacifique avec le Frog bombes nuclears.  Je reckon vous must
    have un spot in La Belle France itself pour les explosions.
    Le Massive Central?  Le Quay d'Orsay?  Le Champs Elysees?
    Votre own back yard, peut etre?

    Frappez le crows avec stones, Sport!  La guerre cold est fini!
    Votres forces militaire need la bombe atomique about as
    beacoup as poisson need les bicyclettes.

    Un autre point, cobber.  Votre histoire militaire isn't tres flash,
    consisting, n'est-ce pas, of battailles the likes of Crecy,
    Agincourt, Poitiers, Trafalgar, Borodino, Waterloo, Sedan, et
    Dien Bien Phu.  Un bombe won't change le tradition.  Je/mon pere/
    mon grand pere/le cousing third avec ma grandmere/la plume de ma tante
    fought avec votre soldats against Le Boche in WWI (le Big One).
    Have vous forgotten?

    Reconsider, mon ami, otherwise in le hotels et estaminets de
    l'Australie le curse anciens d'Angleterre - "Damnation to the French" -
    will be heard un autre temps.

    Votre chums don't want that.

    Millo.

Regarding mulp &lt;pettengill@cvg.enet.dec.com&gt;'s message:

Of course, Scott Bradner is of Harvard, not MIT.  (I've never met
a nicer "sob".  I wonder why I never thought to ask him if his
middle name does, in fact, start with an O?)  I am unable to
determine how much this initial false premise undermines the rest
of the message.

I did enjoy your rejoinder to pay cash for everything, but don't
use an ATM card (or an ATM network??) to get it!

Eagerly awaiting the movie "The Net"...

Re Russell Mast's fantasy of some grunt fantasizing about his spending habits,
see Neal Stephenson's story in Wired nine or so months ago.  That's the same
guy who wrote _Snow Crash_ and the relatively-new _Diamond Age_.  The story
is called, I believe, "The Spew".

Russell Mast imagines "some grunt worker" marvelling at the variety of
places where he charges things.  Actually, it's all done by computer.
They are watching and compiling lists of where you travel, what you
buy and your brand preferences.  I was nervous last year that someone
would notice my following purchases in September: 4 sheets of cheap
outdoor grade plywood, 4 dozen (automobile) gutter hooks and 3 dozen
giant rubber suction cups.

Of course, as Jerry Leichter pointed out to me, this does terminate
after 156 iterations, as "BUGS" was stored in an 8-bit integer, and
the programmer didn't check for overflow.

Subject: Illegal encryption

In fact, there is a bill introduced by our old friend Sen. Grassley (S.974),
called the "Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act of 1995", that would make all
non-escrowed encryption on a network illegal.  It probably won't get anywhere
before the August recess.

If you want to see the text of the bill, it's at

        gopher://gopher.panix.com/00/vtw/c104/s974/bill

or E-mail "send s974" to vtw@vtw.org for a copy.

The VTW (Voter's Telecommunication Watch) is concerned about this bill, but
considers the Communications Decency Act fight to be more urgent at the moment.

 &gt; DISCARD AFTER 5,000 YEARS Researchers at Los Alamos National
 &gt; Laboratory have developed a data storage technique that uses an ion
 &gt; beam to inscribe data in a space the size of 500 atoms and saves it
 &gt; for up to 5,000 years.
 &gt;
 &gt; [&gt;Where do you inscribe the instructions for building a

Actually I think that was just the point of the pin thing; you can
write not just bits but actual visible dots &amp; lines right on the
thing, enabling you to *print* (albeit in very tiny type, but
everyone's got microscopes) just exactly how the rest of the thing's
encoded, in English or Latin or your favorite lingua franca.

Your comment about the impermanence of magnetic media reminded me to
recommend "Silicon Snake Oil" by Clifford Stoll.  Unlike his first
book ("The Cuckoo's Egg"), which is a mystery, "Silicon Snake Oil" is
an almost stream of consciousness ramble about the limits of what
computers and networks can be expected to do.  Perhaps more
importantly, he discusses the problems which can (or perhaps must)
occur in virtual communities, and how these problems differ from those
in "real" communities.

Particularly in the early chapters he overstates the case, but it's
well worth reading.  Just as P.B. Medawar's "The Limits of Science"
should be required reading for anyone listening to public scientific
debates, "Silicon Snake Oil" should be required reading for anyone
using the phrase "information super-highway", though I do find more to
disagree with in Stoll's book than in Medawar's book.

 The kool thing about Clifford Stoll was that he was your basic sys
 admin when he caught those spies and now he's a world expert.  That's
 why I do Desperado, so I too can be a world expert.
