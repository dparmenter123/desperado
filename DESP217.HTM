In the course of building a project at school, I had occasion to use a manual
for a Mitsubishi programmable controller. I suspect that this document was
translated from Japanese to English by someone who only speaks Serbo-Croatian,
at least if the opening pages are any indication:

        "Purpose

        This book is intended as a learning and for those who although have
        some experience in relay sequence control, the use of the programmable
        controller for such a sequence is still unfamiliar.

        For anyone without any experience at all, the advantages and the
        simple nature of programmable controllers over relay boxes are still
        clearly visible.

        Style

        The theme of this book is based on examples. The reader should think
        about how the shown solutions are made from the application examples.
        In this way the reader does not just read, but thinks as well. Thus
        the learning process may be made with emphasis on understanding
        rather memorizing. [I did NOT leave out any words here. That's
        really what it says. -Ed.]

        Please note that explanations have been made around the MITSUBISHI
        Micro-programmable controller because of its simplicity. However,
        it should not limit the reader to Micro's[sic] only. Treat this as a
        stepping stone for larger systems in the automation hierarchy."

Fortunately, someone who spoke some English translated most of the rest
of the book. Unfortunately, the person in charge of the above preface was
also assigned to write the appendices. Appendix 3 is full of paragraphs
like:

        "Model Difference

        The detection[sic] in which current may flow from a terminal can
        be in one of two ways; in or out. Hence two conventions exist
        and appropriately to cater for this, different models of
        programmable controllers exist."

I have to wonder if this writer knows any more about catering conventions
than he/she does about writing ("For lunch, we'll serve seaweed salad with
squid ink dressing, and finish with cork-flavored ice cream. There are
250 attendees, so I figure we'll need about 400 servings. Enough for seconds.")

We now return you to our previously scheduled workday, already in progress.
                                -Caryn

If you finger weather@synoptic.mit.edu, you get a string that describes
some NOAA weather observations at Logan airport.  In addition to weather
data, you get Massachusetts regional forecasts (short-term for 6 or 7
regions), a 5-7 day New England long range forecast, etc.

Then there's the climatological data: degree-days heating &amp; cooling,
record temperatures, max wind speeds, sunrise/sunset times, etc.  This
is where the data above come from.  I have a Statice application that
records a bunch of things like this; the table above is the result of a
query.  (See ref'd files if you're interested.)

Subject: Computational Cosmology, and the Theology of Unix

For what it's worth, that doesn't sound like a binmail bug.  It sounds
like you people are not running binmail on the file server and also
have not enabled network root access.

It works like this.  Sun has this spiffy network file system.
Unfortunately, it doesn't have any real theory of access control.
This is partly because unix doesn't have one either.  It has two
levels: mortal and God.  God (i.e. root) can do anything.  The problem
is that networks make things polytheistic: Should my workstation's God
be able to turn your workstation into a pillar of salt?  Well gee,
that depends on whether my God and your God are on good terms or maybe
are really just the SAME God.  This is a deep and important
theological question which has puzzled humankind for millenia.

The Sun kernel has a user-patchable cosmology.  It contains a
polytheism bit called "nobody".  When network file requests come in
from root (i.e. God), it maps them to be requests from the value of
the kernel variable "nobody" which as distributed is set to -1 which
by convention corresponds to no user whatsoever, rather than to 0, the
binary representation of God (*).  The default corresponds to a
basically Greek pantheon in which there are many Gods and they're all
trying to screw each other (both literally and figuratively in the
Greek case).  However, by using adb(1) to set the kernel variable
"nobody" to 0 in the divine boot image, you can move to a Ba'hai
cosmology in which all Gods are really manifestations of the One Root
God, Zero, thus inventing monotheism.

Thus when the manifestation of the divine spirit, binmail, attempts to
create a mailbox on a remote server on a monotheistic unix, it will be
able to invoke the divine change-owner command so as to make it
profane enough for you to touch it without spontaneously combusting
and having your eternal soul damned to hell.  On a polytheistic unix,
the divine binmail isn't divine so your mail file gets created by
"nobody" and when binmail invokes the divine change-owner command, it
is returned an error code which it forgets to check, knowing that it
is in fact, infallible.

So, patch the kernel on the file server or run sendmail on the server.

-ian

(*) That God has a binary representation is just another clear
indication that Unix is extremely cabilistic and was probably written
by disciples of Alestair Crowley.

Subj:   floored by the DOCTOR program [Desperado submission]

This happened in the mid-70's at BBN. One day we were fooling around
with the local version of the DOCTOR program, that piece of Lisp code
that attempts to simulate Rogerian psychotherapy. ("I feel bad." "Why
do you say you feel bad?")

We typed the word "sex" over and over at it, and managed to get out all
its canned phrases on the subject. Tiring of this, we typed:

        So what else is new?

and the program responded:

        Suppose what else were not new?

                         ROCK'N'ROLL HALL OF FAME

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Long-touted, long-awaited, and now, I believe, out of date, the
Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame piece!  (This is not as old as some of the stuff
in this issue.)

Is it the "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"?  Or the "Rock'n'roll Hall of Fame"?
I'm going with the latter.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Here's a list of the members of the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame in
        Cleveland plus some comments.  Where I say nothing, I have nothing
        to say.

        LaVerne Baker

        Well, she belongs, I guess.  I wish there were a live album that
        really showed her power.  Nothing much to listen to on her hits,
        but "Tomorrow Night" was brilliant, and so was her album of Bessie
        Smith songs.

        Hank Ballard

        This really should be "Hank Ballard and the Midnighters". I'm
        enormously gratifiesd to see Hank Ballard's name in the Hall..
        Cranked up tube-amped guitar, big voice up front, gospel harmonies
        in the back, rank and raunchy lyrics, what "rock" means, what
        "roll" means, "Work with me Annie", "Sexy Ways" (much covered),
        "The Twist", which they ripped off from a gospel singer who
        couldn't market it, and were in turn ripped off by Dick Clark and
        Chubby Checker, who had a hit on it twice, but Hank is still out
        there crankin'.  And Hank beat both Chubby and Dick into the Hall!
        Hey now!  It's finger pop poppin time!

        The Beatles

        The best.

        The Beach Boys

        They set out to combine the best of Chuck Berry with the best of
        the Four Freshman.  May you come so close to your goals.

        Chuck Berry

        Chuck, on the other hand, wanted to be Nat King Cole, but he turned
        out to be Chuck Berry.

        James Brown

        Four entire careers: legendary r&amp;b singer, funk innovator, hardest
        working man in show business, sampled half to death.  Now out of
        jail and read to go on career number five.  When they inducted him
        into the Hall, JB was careful to point out that the other two
        inductees (can't remember which) were now oldies acts while *he*
        had a number-one record, "Livint in America".  Good God!

        The Byrds

        I still think "Gilded Palace of Sin" is a better album than
        "Sweetheart of the Rodeo".  I play it more, for sure.  Gene Clark
        died this weekend.  He wrote "Feel a Whole Lot Better", my favorite
        Byrds song, and one I loved to sing when I was in a band.

        Ray Charles

        Ray Charles wasn't born special.  He *decided* to be special and
        succeeded.

        His blindness:  He saw his brother drown and could do nothing about
        it and started going blind.

        He's from south Georgia, Albany, just up the road from my home
        town.  Also from south Georgia, Macon, Little Richard, Otis
        Redding, the Allman Brothers.  Nobody's from Valdosta but me and my
        brothers.

        The Coasters

        Performers of *THE* rock'n'roll anthem:  "Baby That Is
        Rock'n'Roll":

        "You say our music's for the birds,
        "And you can't understand the words,
        "Well Honey if you did, You'd really blow yo lid, "
        "Cause Baby that is rock and roll."

        Take that, Tipper.

        Best unknown songs:  "Idol With a Golden Head"; "What is the Secret
        of Your Success?"

        Eddie Cochran

        The Brits loved 'im better than we did.  Catch him in "The Girl
        Can't Help It".

        Sam Cooke

        Get his Live in Miami album and completely change your mind as to
        what he's all about.  He's even greater than you think.

        Bobby Darin

        This is the one name that absolutely does not belong.   Bobby
        Darin was about as important as Jurgen Ingman in the history of
        rock'n'roll.  Jurgen, for those with tragically short memories, was
        the perpetrator of "Baby Sitter Boogie" in German.  Bobby was just
        another show-biz hero and had nowhere near the impact on
        rock'n'roll of. hmm, let's see, Huey Smith, the Beau Brummels, Ian
        Dury, or any of a number of people who'll probably never make it
        into the Hall.  The only real rock'n'roll song in Darin's oeurve is
        "Splish Splash" and that was actually recorded under the name of
        Dickie Do and the Don'ts.  Everything else was just pop music, and
        sappy at that. I'm only guessing, but his inclusion looks like a
        sop to traditional show biz, sort of standing in for Perry Como
        singing "KoKoMo" and Dean Martin singing "Gentle on My Mind" and
        poor old Snooky Lanson single-handedly killing off "Your Lucky
        Strike Hit Parade" with ten weeks of trying to sing "Hound Dog". An
        alternative theory is that Bobby Darin got in because he died.

        Bo Diddley

        I saw a documentary about Mississippi bluesmen.  One of them took a
        piece of wire and strung it on a porch rail and tightened it down a
        bit and then plucked it.  "That's what you call a diddley bow."

        Dion

        I caught Dion with the Dave Edmunds Rock'n'Roll Revue last year.  I
        have to say I never really consciously appreciated him before then,
        but to hear him roll out all those hits in that magnificent voice
        really changed my mind.  "The Wanderer" is a better "drifter" song
        than anything in hillbilly music.

        The Drifters

        Two complete careers, two styles, two different groups, one
        rapacious management.

        The first Drifters, mostly featuring Clyde McPhatter (stolen from
        Billy Ward and the Dominos) were a raucous r&amp;b group who gave us
        "Money Honey", "Honey Love", "Ruby Baby" (the original and one that
        sorta blew Dion away, which maty be why it took me so long to catch
        on to him), the rhythm'n'blues version of "White Christmas" and
        many others, including the little-known classic, "What You Gonna
        Do?"

        And then, in 1959, appeared, the smooth, the romantic, the
        Latin-tinged Drifters with "Save the Last Dance for Me", "There
        Goes My Baby", "Under the Boardwalk", and "Up on the Roof".  The
        story is almost too sad good to be true, but the lead singer of the
        Drifters of that era (not Ben E. King) was killed in a brawl the
        night before they recorded "On Broadway" and the second tenor had
        to fill in that morning:  "They say the neon lights are bright on
        Broadway . . . "

        Bob Dylan

        "Blowin in the Wind" is maybe the most cynical song ever recorded.

        Fats Domino

        Fats does 20 weeks a year in Las Vegas, lives in a mansion in New
        Orleans, still has Dave Bartholomew as his bandleader and is still
        the fat, happy man we want to remember.

        Once he heard that Pat Boone was in the audience unnanounced at one
        of his gigs.  Fats dragged Pat up on the stage and introduced him
        as "the man who made me a millionaire".  They then did "Ain'T That
        a Shame" together, which Pat had covered in one of those notorious
        whitebread versions back in the 50s.  So much for moral outrage.

        The Everly Brothers

        Nobody can sing together like brothers, and no brothers can sing
        together like the Everly Brothers.  One early name the Beatles used
        was "the Foreverly Brothers".

        Marvin Gaye

        A grand mix of sex and religion cooked up when Prince was taking
        Spanish I and Introductory Shop in high school.

        Buddy Holly

        Johnny Ace was the first rock'n'roll tragedy, but Buddy may have
        been the biggest.  What an experimenter.  Certainly made the Big
        Bopper go down in history.

        B.B. King

        Ex-deejay, nephew to Bukka White, claimed as a cousin by Freddie
        King, the first LOUD GUITAR player of all time, the greatest pure
        voice in pop blues, maybe a little slick, but proud to be a
        bluesman and not a bit interested in being anything else.  Great
        unknown single:  "Dark is the Night".  Riff fans, seek it out.

        The Kinks

        Another winning choice, progenitors of forms, from heavy metal
        ("You Really Got Me") to rinky-dink social irony ("Well-Respected
        Man", "Sunny Afternoon")) to gloriusly realized transvestism
        ("Lola") to punk ("Who'll Be the Next in Line?") to one of the most
        beautiful songs of the twentieth century ("Waterloo Sunset") to
        "Jack Jack the Idiot Dunce" ("You oughta see that idiot rock!")

        The Four Seasons

        Vivaldi did it better, but they were half of white rock'n'roll
        between Jerry Lee Lewis's marriage and the Beatles' return from
        Hamburg.

        The Four Tops

        They've been together since boyhood, singing different parts as
        they aged, "But Levi was *always* the lead singer".

        Greatest song:  "Seven Rooms of Gloom".  Greatest irony: "It's the
        Same Old Song", which it is, with the same old sax solo.  Moment in
        time:  "Walk Away Renee".

        Aretha Franklin

        If you ever get a chance to hear one of the sermons of her father,
        the Bishop C.L. Franklin, take it.  "The Eagle Stirreth in Her
        Nest" is a real rouser.

        Aretha wanted to be a happy housewife.

        Bill Haley

        Bearer of the message, but it was written in a tongue he really
        didn't understand.  Craziest tune:  "Crazy Man Crazy".

        The Impressions

        Clyde McPhatter got in separate from the Drifters (but no Ben E.
        King).  Will Jerry Butler make it separate from the Impressions?

        There are so many great performers, the idea of a Hall of Fame is
        pretty ridiculous, I guess.  Where's Norma Tenegra?

        Jerry Lee Lewis

        One of the stars you wouldn't want to have live next door.  Worth
        100 of his cousins, Mickey Gilley and Jimmie Swaggart, but they can
        all play that piano.  Some say the reason Jimmy Swaggart hated
        rock'n'roll so much was that the players were mostly so much worse
        than he was.  Jerry Lee sincerely believes rock'n'roll is the
        devil's music, but he plays it anyway. A brave man.

        Little Richard

        He and Bumps Blackwell, his bandleader, spent two whole days in a
        hotel room practicing the line "saw Aunt Mary comin an he ducked
        back in the alley".

        That's Lee Allen on tenor, usually, on Little Richard's 50s hits.
        There are no instrumentalists in the Hall.  No Lee Allen, Link
        Wray, Mickey Baker, Sam the Man Taylor, Panama Francis . . .

        Clyde McPhatter

        See The Drifters.  Great churchy tenor.  Catch "The Bells of St.
        Mary" for some soul-stirring sobbing.  Catch him singing lead on
        "Have Mercy Baby" for lessons in how to rip up the joint while
        standing in a sterile studio.

        Will The Spiders ever make it to the Hall?

        Ricky Nelson

        The only manufactured teen idol who had any idea what he was doing
        up there.

        His father Ozzie, played alto and had a big band, featuring
        vocalist Harriet Hilliard.  His sons are now the stars of Nelson.
        A real show-biz family.

        Roy Orbison

        Lots of sad, sweet stories about Roy.   The Everly Brothers'
        "Claudette" was written by him about his first wife, later killed
        in a motorcycle accident.

        Carl Perkins

        Only man to catapult a Blind Lemon Jefferson song into the hit
        parade.  That song, "Matchbox" was also covered by the Beatles.
        One-song thumbnail history of rock'n'roll.  After the Beatles were
        famous, they arranged for Carl to meet them at some show or party.
        Carl was standing in the back of the room, too shy to come
        forward, because he'd overheard several people saying "Is he here?
        When's he coming?  I can't wait to meet him?"  Carl didn't know
        they were all talking about him.

        If they replay the Cinemax special, tape it, and see all those
        famous guitar players glowing with pride because they're playing
        along with Carl.

        Wilson Pickett

        Greatest screamer ever.  Grand many with covers.  Not only "Hey
        Jude" (with Duane Allman's introduction to the wider world), but
        also "Sugar Sugar", yes, the Archies song.  Poor that sugar on
        Wilson, honey.

        The Platters

        Okay, so I beefed about Bobby Darin, but on the other hand, the
        Platters stay.  Am I inconsistent, Walt Whitman?  Very well.  I
        contain multitudes.  The first producer-created act.  Buck Ram was
        the producer.

        Elvis Presley

        The first white man to get out there and shake his moneymaker.

        Hear "Reconsider Baby", which should have been titled "Elvis Sings
        the Blues".  "Santa Claus is Back in Town" should have been on the
        album.

        Elvis was a true lover of the blues and many of the vocal and
        emotional effects that he was capable of, even in non-blues songs,
        can be traced to blues artists and blues styles.  On the liner
        notes to the album, "Elvis Sings the Blues", blues great Willie
        Dixon is quoted as saying, "He's not a blues singer, but he gets
        his push from the blues."  I'd go further and say he is a
        completely authentic and convincing blues performer who also sings
        many other kinds of  songs, often with a blues intonation or a
        blues style in the performance. Thus, listening to Elvis sing the
        blues, you can get a sense of how he's able to do so much with
        essentially mundane material like "Wear My Ring" or "Teddy Bear".

        Still capable of surprise:  I had listened to "Baby, Youre So
        Square" for three decades without ever figuring out that Elvis
        wasn't resigning himself to his baby's squareness, but was warning
        her that she wouldn't be square after he got through with her.  It
        was the intro and the guitar solo that helped me figure this out.

        Favorite factoid:  one of the networks, NBC I think, did *not* lead
        with Elvis's death on the day he died.  It took eight months for
        their ratings to recover.

        Perhaps the greatest cover artist of all time.  In some later ish
        I'll hit you with the list.

        Otis Redding

        "Pain in my Heart".

        Simon &amp; Garfunkel

        To this day, Paul Simon won't admit to being a rock'n'roller, but
        definitely a pair of beautiful voices and a few rockers along the
        way, "Cecilia" and "Baby Driver", but gee, compare with Harry
        Nilsson.

        Smokey Robinson

        Could have made it on songwriting alone.  Meaning, the Miracles
        ought to have been mentioned here.

        The Rolling Stones

        The greatest rock'n'roll band.

        The Supremes

        Keep "Baby Love" and trash the rest.

        The Temptations

        Pull 'em out and listen to 'em.

        Big Joe Turner

        "The Boss of the Blues", my desert island main man.  I can't talk
        about him he's so great.  Do me and your taste in music a favor and
        go listen to *any* recording by Big Joe from 1935 to 1984 or
        whatever a rocker beginning, middle, and end, and who needs a
        PA?  Not Joe.  Okay, one song from each decade then:  "Roll 'Em
        Pete" from the 30s, "Careless Love" from the 40s, "Shake Rattle and
        Roll" from the 50s, "Cherry Red" from the 60s, some live album from
        the 70s, and the album he cut with Roomful of Blues (Pat who?) in
        the 80s.

        Ike &amp; Tina Turner

        Ike - produced and played on one of the dozens of entrants in the
        "first rock'n'roll single ever" sweepstakes, Jackie Brenston's
        "Rocket 88", a bit of a snoozer for my money.  Someone else did
        "Rocket 69" around the same time, a much peppier song.

        Ike and Tina - recorded "River Deep Mountain High", a magnificent
        achievement whose failure led directly to Phil Spector's retirement

        Ike and Tina and the Ikettes - opened for the Rolling Stones and
        blew away a lot of hippies who'd never seen a soul show.

        Ike and Tina - covered "Proud Mary"

        Tina - "Private Dancer" and "What's Love Got to Do With It?"

        Not exactly in the Chuck Berry league.  On the other hand, way
        ahead of Bobby Darin, who inexplicably got in there two years ahead
        of I &amp; T.

        Muddy Waters

        Hot damn!  Muddy's in the Main Hall, not in the Forefather's
        section.

        Jackie Wilson

        Would he have made it if Van Morrison hadn't written a song about
        him?  Who can say.  He belongs.

        Stevie Wonder

        Four great albums and forty hits isn't enough.  We're waiting for
        more.

        The Who

        Alright.

        SONGWRITERS/NON-PERFORMERS:

        Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller

        Reocrd producers and songwriters.  "Hound Dog", all the Coasters
        songs, "Is That All There Is?"

        Ahmet Ertegun

        Son of the Turkish ambassador and founder of Atlantic Records,
        author of many an R&amp;B classic under the ingenious nom-du-disque A.
        Nugutre.

        Jerry Wexler

        The rapacious management of the Drifters mentioned above, but he
        knew what a hit sounded like.

        Leonard Chess

        I saw a picture of a Chuck Berry session with little old Jewish
        businessman Leonard Chess in a hat and a suit pounding on a bass
        drum to beef up the backbeat so you couldn't lose it.

        Sam Phillips

        He knew what he was looking for, but he didn't know what to charge
        for it when he found it and sold it.

        Alan Freed

        Never heard him broadcast, but a victim of the anti-fun forces, for
        sure.

        Berry Gordy Jr.

        Phil Spector

        I love it that the failure of "River Deep Mountain High" drove him
        out of the business and was his swan song but then he returned to
        ruin a Beatles album as his final swan song.

        Holland-Dozier-Holland

        Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King

        FOREFATHERS:

        Jimmie Rodgers

        The first big-selling country artist, the first
        popular singer-songwriter, the father of the blue yodel.  The man
        who single-handedly brought the blues *and* country music to
        the American consciousness.  Greatest song:  "T for Texas"

        "I'm gonna buy me a shotgun, just as long as I am tall,
        "I'm gonna shoot pore Thelma just to see her jump and fall."

        Robert Johnson

        The greatest and deepest of guitar-picking blues singers.  Despite
        all the mythology that surrounds him, I listen to his records and I
        hear a brilliant entertainer.

        Jimmy Yancey

        It's so nice for him to be here.  Not a flashy  boogie woogie
        player, but so soulful, subtle, swinging.  An ideal that could
        inspire any pop artist.  And *nobody* was ever better at endings.
        If you've heard him, you'll know what I mean, but if you haven't,
        you couldn't ever guess.

        T-Bone Walker

        Chuck Berry's inspiration, the first rock guitar player, probably.
        "They Call It Stormy Mondy (But Tuesday's Just As Bad")

        Hank Williams

        If you don't like Hank Williams, as the song goes, you can kiss my
        ass.

        Louis Jordan (and the Tympany Five)

        The epitome of the jive combo.

        John Lee Hooker

        Still boogying, chillen.

        The Ink Spots

        The mellow black harmony group, the power of a tenor, a very
        soulful group.

        Jimmy Reed

        Sould have been in the main Hall.  His songs will be played by rock
        bands as long as Chuck Berry';s, but he's *never* gotten the
        credit.  Why is this man not in the Black Who's Who in America?  So
        few people have invented a brand new kind of song.  He invented the
        Jimmy Reed song.

        Bessie Smith

        Her record sales, to whites and blacks, kept Columbia in business
        during the depression, but she was also the Empress of the Blues.

        The Soul Stirrers

        Great black gospel group.  They're in here because that's where Sam
        Cooke and Jackie Wilson got started.

        Les Paul

        Electric guitars made rock'n'roll and Les Paul made the electric
        guitar happen (although Leo Fender and his funny bass ought to get
        in too.)

        Woodie Guthrie

        Representing the political folkie tradition, and  very ably.

        Leadbelly

        Author of "Goodnight, Irene", powerful man on the  12-string,  even
        more powerful on vox humana, reputed author of  "Midnight Special",
        convict, great personality.

        Louis Armstrong

        The first great instrumentalist in American music, one of the
        greatest improvisors of all time, fabulous tone, great  voice,
        first scat singer on record, and he could rock.

        Charlie Christian

        The first guitar hero, introduced the world to the electric guitar,
        one of the first black players in a white band  (Benny Goodman's),
        died tragically young, advanced harmonic and  melodic imagination,
        love to hear him with a Strat and a stack o' Marshalls. (Django
        Reinhardt might slip in here.)

        Ma Rainey

        Great act on the road, less influential in recordings, but the
        Mother of the Blues.

        These "forefathers" were all part of the rise of truly popular
        people's music in the 20th century, a movement of which rock'n'roll
        is a beneficiary and prime mover.

        The "Songwriters/Nonperformers" seems to be the weakest section.
        There's only one disc jockey, no promoters (Bill Graham?), only two
        producers, Lieber and  Stoller who were also songwriters, and
        Leonard Chess, who owned the company (and how come Phil Chess is
        excluded?  And what about Marshall Chess, who saved the company?)
        There are only ten on the list at that (14 people), but John
        Hammond, who discovered and first recorded about half the Hall of
        Fame, including forefathers, isn't on there.

And then, here's a tribute to the 45 rpm record written by Brent
Higinbotham, sax player and ex-Digit (packaged out in December.  This
originally appeared in a forum I won't identify.

        A year or so ago, the rumor was out that the last 45 rpm record
had been pressed. The very last one ever. Like most rumors, there was more
fiction than fact at work. To this day there are 45s being released, but
it is has seemingly become easier to find a 45 automatic than a 45 rpm
record. With that thought in mind, let me wax (get it?) nostalgic on the
decline of the 45.

        I have a huge collection of the little black discs with the big
holes -- great for carrying a stack around on your thumb -- that spans
around 35 years of (relatively) popular music.

        These records, or "platters" as the cool DJs used to say, came in
one diameter (7"), but two thicknesses: the thin flexible "unbreakable" ones
from the Big Labels like RCA and Liberty and Capitol, and the thick brittle
ones from the small independent labels like Warwick and Amy and Laurie. The
thin discs held up well, and continue to sound decent, but the thick ones
tended to lose their sheen, both physical and musical, and the material of
the disc actually deteriorated over time. But for me, barbarian that I am,
the technology of reproduction has always taken a back seat to the music
itself; a pop? a tick? Hah! That won't stop me! (Hell, it better not -- much
of my oddball collection has never found its way to the hi-tech CD or even LP
format. Anyone have a Tico and the Triumphs LP? The Piltdown Men on CD?)

        So I hang onto these babies, and still occasionally add to my
collection through record conventions, yard sales, Salvation Army stores and
flea markets. Besides, the quest comes to a much more exhilarating conclusion
when you find that long-sought for 45 beneath a dead toaster in "Sally's
Antique Basement", than when you walk into "Mall Tapes and CDs" and grab
something off the wall rack.

        My first (new) 45 was by a guy who called himself U.S. Bonds, and
sang a hit entitled "New Orleans". It was on thick disc from LeGrand records,
and cost me 79 cents. There were cheaper records available -- down to 59
cents for new releases, as I recall. On the other hand, our local record shop
had the nerve to charge 99 cents for those two two-and-a-half minute sides!
(And a new LP was 3.99! What a gyp!)

        2:30 still seems about right to me; the singer does two verses, the
bridge, sax solo, verse or two more, and out. Short and sweet. After some
producer realized the public would sit enthralled for 10 minutes of "Inna-
Gadda-Da-Vida", it was all over -- the recording world was no longer about
"songs", it was about "product". We've progressed from Buddy Holly to Milli
Vanilli.

        The doughnut sized labels spoke to me. Federal and King were dark
blue like the blues of their dark artists: James Brown, Hank Ballard, Bill
Doggett and Earl Bostic. Atlantic was half black and red with the soulful
fire of Wilson Pickett and Don Covay. Motown was that funny purple for the
smoother stylings of the Temptations. Bright orange for Chubby Checker's
bright dance pop. White and red for Dion and the Belmonts. Black for Fats
Domino. It all made perfect sense to me.

        Then, in order to tuck all these diversified artists and styles into
my own smaller world, I'd put tiny white stickers -- very unobtrusively -- on
these colorful labels, and arrange them in those two-tone cardboard 45 cases
with the handles on top. (I believe they have one of these preserved in the
Museum of Modern Art. If not, they should ...)

        The 45 introduced me to a lot of good music very cheaply. Back when
K-Mart was still Kresge's, Woolworth's was preceded by an F.W., and W.T.
Grant's was downtown -- there were big bins of loose 45 cut-outs for 5 or
10 cents each. (CD cut-outs are 5 to 10 DOLLARS each!) And there were 7x7x1"
boxes with 10 records inside: two popular ones showing through the windows
on each side, and eight throwaways (the interesting stuff!) in between. Well,
that's how I discovered r&amp;b and jazz. I put together a complete set of Otis
Redding's Volt singles for 25 cents to 75 cents a pop. With great Otis flip
sides that have never shown up his LPs or CD reissues. I found singles on the
Riverside jazz label. Wanton Kelly, Cannonball, Paul Chambers. Wow! What IS
this music?!

        Today, there is simply no way for a kid to cheaply experiment with new
artists and styles. No way for a white suburban kid watching Bobby Rydell and
Frankie Avalon on Bandstand (or George Michaels and Billy Idol on MTV) to
plunk down a buck or two and buy a stack of recordings by guys with little
known names but very possibly big talents, just to hear something different.

        Just to hear (see, eat, feel, etc.) something DIFFERENT -- not
Nintendo or Ninja Turtles or McDonalds or MTV -- but something different.
T'ain't easy. The mass media and the almighty dollar pretty much determine our
narrowing range of choices these days. When was the last time you bought a
random handful of unknown cassingles at 2.99 a piece? A couple of CDs by
unknown artists at 12 bucks a pop, just for the hell of it?

        Time was when a guy with 500 bucks, an empty garage and a Wollensack
tape recorder had a chance of his music being heard. People could plunk down
their 79 cents and check it out. I wish we still could ...

        I miss the 45.

Dear List Organizers and List Members:
        We would appreciate your sharing this seven-screen Announcement of
an Electronic Journal.  Thanks.
                                        Ted Jennings

**** About _EJournal_, part 1; approximately 2 screens --

        _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, Bitnet/Internet distributed,
peer-reviewed, academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in
theory and praxis surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic text.  We are
also interested in the broader social, psychological, literary, economic
and pedagogical implications of computer-mediated networks.  Texts that
address virtually any subject across this broad spectrum will be given
thoughtful consideration.

        Members of the electronic-network community and others
interested in it make up a large portion of our audience.  Therefore we
would be interested (for example) in essays about whether or not anyone
should own a communication that has been shared electronically, about
the pragmatics of cataloguing and indexing electronic publications,
about net-based collaborative learning, about artful uses of hypertext,
about the challenges that distance learning may offer to residential
campuses, about the role of The Matrix in cultural history and Utopian
polemic, about digitally recorded aleatoric fiction, about the
significance of resemblances between the electronic matrix and neural
systems, . . .  and so forth.

        The journal's essays will be available free to Bitnet/Internet
addresses.  Recipients may make paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide
authenticated paper copy from our read-only archive for use by academic
deans or other supervisors.  Individual essays, reviews, stories-- texts
--sent to us will be disseminated to subscribers as soon as they have
been through the editorial process, which will also be "paperless."  We
expect to offer access through libraries to our electronic Contents,
Abstracts, and Keywords, and to be indexed and abstracted in appropriate
places.

        _EJournal_ is now soliciting essays for possible publication.  We
will be happy to consider reviews, letters, and (eventually) annotations
that ought to accompany texts we have already published.  We would be
happy to add interested specialists and generalists to our panel of
consulting editors.

        Please send essays for review, and inquiries, to
                        ejournal@albnyvms.bitnet

"In Hollywood, they like you to make your character easy to
understand:  If he's a good guy, he pets the cat.  If he's a bad guy,
he kicks the cat.  If he's a complex guy, he bakes the cat, and if
he's a very complex guy, he won't eat it."  -- Edward J. Brookstein

hmd = heavy metal dude picking up trash.

fcp: "Do you reaaaallly like me?"
hmd: "mumble mumble ... burp.."
fcp: "You're really cute.. I hope you really like me as much as you say"
hmd: "fuck mumble mumbler growl..."
fcp: "YOU WENT OUT WITH HER!"
hmd: "yeah"
fcp: "I thought you wanted me!"
hmd: "yeah"
fcp: "Oh good...  so you only went out with her because she asked you and
                not because you like her..."
hmd: "sumpin mumble grumble"
fcp: "you wouldn't lie to me would you.. you're too cute to lie.."
hmd: "nah.."
fcp: "you wanna do what we did last night in that room?"
hmd: "excellent...."

Subj:   Bytes et al.

&gt; Subject: Desperado #3041: Buggre Alle this for a Larke.

&gt; If 8 bits is a byte, is 10 bits an overbyte?

I'm reminded of an old one, from my previous life in south Florida.  We
were designing a fancy disk controller for the Air Farce, for use in
tracking missiles fired from Vandenberg AFB into the South Pacific.
The radar that it's connected to is just about capable of taking a
10-microsecond peek at an airplane 100 miles away and then telling you
what the pilot ate for breakfast.

This disk controller, which is still happily chewing bits out there on
a remarkably desolate island called Kwajalein, talks to special disk
drives that record nine tracks in parallel instead of the usual
single-track bit-serial scheme.  When it's running, the system fills a
300-megabyte disk pack in about 2.5 minutes.  The controller owns two
disk drives, and there's a person whose entire job is to stand there
and change disk packs so that there's always a fresh one ready when the
current one is full.

Since the entire data path from the radar into the computer keeps track
of all nine bits, we deemed "byte" an inapropriate term.  So we coined
the term "munch."  Each munch consists of eight data bits and a parity
bit.

Each munch is 1/9 of the entire 81-bit data word, and we decided that
we couldn't very well let pass the opportunity to christen said 81-bit
object a "lunch."  Each lunch consists of eight data munches and a
parity munch, sort of like eating an extra sandwich to make sure the
others tasted good.

These two terms stuck, and when we came to write the functional spec
for the beast, we really didn't have any choice, did we?  In the
preface of the spec, we defined the terms we'd coined, and then we used
them throughout its 100 or more pages of text.  It really was funny to
be sitting there in meetings with the Air Farce guys and watching them
try to figure out whether we were really that weird or were having a
joke at their expense.

Anyway, they bought it that way, so there is one piece of computer
hardware out there in the real world that's always hungry for its
munches and lunches.

        Well, I caught us up to the middle of the huge heap and now it's
        time to go.  I just edited out some really brilliant stuff that was
        too long or too old or too something or other for me to print, even
        though I had intended to.  If you sent me something in the last few
        months that you haven't seen yet, it's either coming in a while or
        I just edited it away to the bit bucket.

        Anyway, remember on Memorial Day, that no matter how sophisticated
        your political opinions are, and how superior your taste, those
        soldiers who died never lived their full lives and they and those
        they left behind deserve your kind thoughts.  I was named after my
        grandfather's brother, killed in World War I.

        More later, and even sort of up to date,

        yr. bdy.
