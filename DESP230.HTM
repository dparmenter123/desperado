        One big difference between men and women that's frequently cited
        in those articles on the mysteries of sex is that men prefer to
        let the toilet paper roll down over the top of the roll while
        women prefer to have it roll off from under the bottom of the
        roll.

        Usually, this is treated as one of those quiddities that just
        can't be explained, not even by a man or a woman.  That's just the
        way they are, spooling their toilet paper, or is it scrolling
        their toilet paper, the wrong way, just like they're wrong about so
        many things.  Ah, the opposite sex; can't live with 'em, can't
        shoot 'em.

        Actually, the difference can be explained, and it illuminates a
        great deal about the difference between men and women.

        The paper rolls off much easier when it's rolled off the top (a la
        homme).  Men see this and think, it rolls off easier from the top,
        therefore orient the paper so it rolls off the top.

        Women see this and say, it rolls off easier off the top, leading
        to long streams of toilet paper all over the floor, wasted paper, a
        need to buy more rolls, a need to replace more rolls, therefore,
        orient the paper so it rolls off the bottom.  And, not only does it
        run out less, but it tears off easier.

        That is, men complete a preliminary analysis of the mechanics of
        the situation and stop.  Women take the mechanics of the situation
        and fit the mechanics into the practical process of living.  They
        are both right, but the men are merely right, while the women are
        really right.

        As of this issue, the Desperado mailing list has more than 1000
        names on it, virtually all by request.  It's not reaped very often,
        so it has some inactive names on it.  On the other hand, many of
        those 1000 subscribers forward to others, some of whom forward to
        others, etc.  I figure total readership at 10 million.

        You're all my buddies, of course, but I was pleased that number
        1000 was someone I actually worked with in the past, Dennis

=o= That "computer virus used in the Gulf War" story is a phony!
It came from an April Fool's column in a computer rag and was
then transmogrified into a Hard News Item (TM).  The government
did not move to correct the press' error, though.

=o= Also, Desperadii may recall another Hard News Item (TM)
about how Iraq's version of Tokyo Rose was sending out radio
broadcasts to lonely servicemen telling them that their wives
were back in the States sleeping with movie star Bart Simpson.
This one came from a Johnny Carson joke.

        I was planning to ask in this ish how a chip stuck in a printer was
        supposed to have propogated a virus.  Quite a handshake there, I
        thought.  It's a lot easier to understand how a hoax ("a virus in
        the public's grasp of issues") gets perpetrated.  When the entire
        world of l'informatique (communications and computation) finally
        merges, there will be no difference between viruses and hoaxes.
        But then, what if that note from puckish Jym is a hoax?

Just today, I was going through the morning's paperwork, and found an envelope
that had clearly been sidetracked since, oh, about 12-Jan-1992

I opened the envelope.  It seemed to be a request for me to review and
comment on a document for some reason.

Subj:   Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees

From: clarinews@clarinet.com
Newsgroups: clari.news.music
Subject: Eleven inducted into Rock Hall of Fame

        NEW YORK (UPI) -- Eleven rhythm and blues, country, and rock legends --
both dead and alive -- were inducted Wednesday into the still-to-be built
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the seventh annual awards ceremony in
Manhattan.
        Bobby ``Blue'' Bland, Johnny Cash, Booker T and the MG's, The Jimi
Hendrix Experience, The Isley Brothers, Sam and Dave, and The Yardbirds
were the performers inducted.
        Also honored were two non-performers, songwriter Doc Pomus and Leo
Fender, creator of the Fender guitar, and two musicians cited for their
early influences on rock 'n' roll, Elmore James and Professor Longhair.
        ``This year's group of inductees represent an era of growing
sophistication and experimentation in rock 'n' roll as well as the
celebration of rhythm and blues music,'' said Suzan Evans, executive
director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, when the
inductees were announced in November.
        The new members of the Hall of Fame, to be built in Cleveland, Ohio,
were introduced at the induction ceremony by contemporary stars
influenced by the inductees.
        The ceremony took place at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.
        Nominees all released records in 1966 or before and were chosen by
more than 600 performers, producers, writers, record executives and
broadcasters.
        Over $40 million has been raised to build the Hall, and construction
is scheduled to begin this summer.
        Since the first ceremony in 1986, 57 individual artists or groups, 19
``early influences'' and 18 non-performers have been inducted into the
Rock Hall of Fame.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Bobby Blue Bland

        Lose the "quotes".  The man's name is Blue as far as I'm
        concerned.  If you would seek his monument, listen to anyone else
        try to do "Turn On Your Love Light".  Great blues stylist,
        sophisticated without being Lou Rawls.  The great Peacock Records
        studio band had a lot to do with the brilliance of
        his music.  (If you seek the band's monument, check out the
        difference between the same band on Bobby Blue Bland tunes and
        Little Junior Parker tunes.)

        Johnny Cash

        Johnny said, "There are lots of others who deserve this honor more
        than me.  I love rock&amp;roll but I'm a country artist through and
        through."  That seems about right.  Probably selected because he
        was a Sun Records artist.  A great performer, if something of a
        Christian windbag the past twenty years.  Loved seeing him jamming
        on stage with the rest of the guys.  His song about why he is "The
        Man in Black" (because as long as there's opression and injustice,
        he'll wear it) displays a certain rock&amp;roll attitude.

        Booker T and the MG's

        Okay, this is one collective where all the members are equally
        worthy of being in the Hall.  It is profoundly satisfying for the
        late Al Jackson Jr, Steve Cropper, Donald Duck Dunn, and Booker T.
        Jones, the literal heart and soul of hundreds of hits, to be in
        there, producers, session men, songwriters.  But, having them in
        here collectively means Steve Cropper won't get in on his own as a
        guitarist and co-songwriter to the stars

        The Jimi Hendrix Experience

        On the other hand, how come this isn't just Jimi?  I always thought
        the band was pretty klunky.  He should've hired real Gypsies.  I
        loved Jimi's singing.

        The Isley Brothers

        If "Twist &amp; Shout" can get you into the Hall of Fame, then how come
        Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs ain't made it yet?  The Isleys have a
        history of being blown away by covers of their own songs.  The
        Beatles did 'em in on "Twist and Shout" and the anonymous Human
        Beinz did 'em in on "Shout".  In for longevity?  Or maybe for "It's
        Your Thing"?  Would anyone have noticed if the Isley Brothers (and
        their guitar-pickin nephew) had been slighted and the Chambers
        Brothers (precursors of house music) gone in?

        Sam and Dave

        A hardworking pair who hated each other.  Victims of the oldies
        paradigm.  I certainly don't care if I ever hear "Soul Man" or
        "Hold On I'm Coming" again.  "When Something is Wrong With My
        Baby", on the other hand, can't be killed by repetition.  Of
        course, it's slow and sad and the oldies stations don't play it
        much.

        The Yardbirds

        A great noisy band who might very well be completely ignored if
        they appeared on the scene today.  I'd rather hear something by the
        Yardbirds than the *average* Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, or (most
        definitely) Eric Clapton cut of the 70s, 80s, or 90s.

        Doc Pomus

        Strange that Mort Shuman (mostly music) didn't go in at the same
        time as his songwriting partner Doc (mostly words).  Doc died of
        cancer and his death is one of the subjects of Lou Reed's new
        album.  I guess Shuman should have died too.  Anyway, alone or with
        Shuman, he wrote some of the best. He wrote Ray Charles's "Lonely
        Avenue" all by himself and the Coasters' "Young Blood" with fellow
        Hall of Famers Lieber and Stoller, but with Shuman he wrote
        "Teenager in Love", "Save the Last Dance for Me", "This Magic
        Moment" (three "Spanish tinge" classics there), and finally the
        King's "Little Sister".

        Leo Fender

        He's credited in the news story as "creator of the Fender guitar",
        but of course he was really the inventor (parallel with Les Paul)
        of the practical solid body electric guitar, which hasn't changed
        significantly since he introduced it in 1948, the inventor of the
        Fender bass, which revolutionized the rhtym sections of the world,
        and the inventor of the various Fender amplifiers, twins, reverbs,
        the lot.  In other words, Leo invented a whold damn system, not
        just a product.

        Elmore James

        Even though he probabably didn't really invent the Elmore James
        riff -- recreated phonetically by Doc Pomus as "Changity changity
        changity changity chang chang" in the song "Down in the Alley" as
        performed by the Clovers (not yet in the Hall!) and by Elvis
        Presley -- Elmo certainly took that riff all over the world (and all
        over most of his hits).  Elmo was no primitive though, he was one
        of Atlantic Records elite corps of studio musicians in the 50s.
        You can hear him playing some mighty smooth stuff on some of those
        cuts.  And what a big old blues shouting voice he had!

        Professor Longhair

        Player of "impossible" piano, singer of irresponsible tonality, a
        man who liked to stay home in New Orleans.  The combination turned
        out to be brilliant, as you can hear on *any* tune he ever cut.

        Strangely, Albert Goldman, whom we all hate for what he did to John
        Lennon and Elvis Presley, and who seems in those books of his
        actually to hate rock&amp;roll, produced a key comeback performance and
        album for 'Fess.  In addition to being billed as Professor
        Longhair, he was also known as Roy "Baldhead" Byrd.  Favorite
        backing band name: Professor Longhair and his Shuffling Hungarians.
        Recent tribute on the Squeeze album "Frank" with a song that
        touches on both 'Fess and Jelly Roll Morton called "Doctor Jazz".
        It's fitting that he should be linked with Jelly Roll.  Jelly Roll
        said that the best music had "that Spanish tinge" and it's for sure
        that 'Fess had the rhumba rhythm in him.

        I caught 'Fess on his last tour.  When he walked out across the
        bandstand so slow, I thought, "Oh well, he was great once, but he's
        over the hill now."  Then he sat down and hit the keys and came
        alive and hooly-molly-wolla-dolla!  The other big memory from that
        night is how proud the hot young musicians he'd brought with him from
        New Orleans were to be playing with him.

        So, when's Jelly Roll going to make it in the Hall?  There are so
        many who belong there?  And what am I going to do when the
        influential bands I hate -- The Doors being the most prominent
        example -- make it into the Hall?  Well, actually, I'm going to
        slag the hell out of them.

        People I'd put in:  The Spiders, the Clovers, Lionel Hampton (and
        what a joke on the pompous rock&amp;roll hater and jazz rerun fixture
        of today to recall his younger hard-rocking self who did so much to
        lay the groundwork . . .),  about fifty-leven hundred disk jockeys
        and record executives (goodness had nothing to do with it), Lee
        Allen, Link Wray, George Martin, Domingo Samudio, Mickey Baker,
        Mickey and Sylvia (that would put Mickey Baker in twice, as he's
        the same Mickey) for recording the first rock&amp;roll record with a
        modern sound, "Little" Sylvia Vanderpool for founding Sugar Hill
        records and therefore starting the rap industry (and yes, it's the
        same Sylvia, so she'd be in twice too), Frank Zappa, Jim Stewart,
        Roger Hawkins, Chips Moman, Spooner Oldham, Dan Penn, Rudolph
        Toombs, Mickie Most, King Curtis, Rick Hall, Chuck Willis, Bumps
        Blackwell, Red Prysock, Red Tyler, Sil Austin, Big Al Sears, Sam
        the Man Taylor, Tiny Grimes . . .  This whole business is so weird.
        If you're famous, you don't need the Hall of Fame, but if you're
        not, the Hall of Fame can make you famous.

        And still no Willie Dixon!  [Written before his death.  I guess he'll
        make it next year.]

        No Dinah Washington!  [Long dead.]

        The mainstream selections seem a little thin this year.  Sam &amp;
        Dave, Isleys, Johnny Cash.  The Pioneer and Extras sections are
        strong as usual.

        Sticking to the mysteriously defined mainstream, can anyone argue
        that these three should've gone in before Creedence Clearwater
        Revival?

        And what else?  Oh, let's see, there could be a Rock&amp;Roll Anthem
        Wing:  "Do You Believe in Magic", "Sweet Cherry Wine", "Anarchy in
        the UK", "Rockin Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu", "I Like It
        Like That", "Orgasm Addict",  "Sex&amp;Drugs&amp;Rock&amp;roll".  A Died For
        Rock&amp;Roll Wing:  Johnny Ace, Keith Moon, Keith Relf, Terry Kath,
        Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Mama Cass, T.Rex, Marvin Gaye, Sam
        Cooke, King Curtis and oh so many more, where the motto is, "I
        don't know if there's a rock&amp;roll heaven, but if there is they've
        got a helluva band."  A Hall of Enemies for creeps like Peter Paul &amp;
        Mounds.  A coke&amp;burger room with a great jukebox.  A smoky little
        bar with a combo playing all the time.  Another smoky little bar
        with a combo playing all the time in a wire cage to protect them
        from the audience.  A smoky little jukejoint with black people
        on the floor and white people huddled behind a rope.  An arena.
        How about an arena simulation with seats for a few, but all the
        weirdness of hearing music in a football stadium?  A psychedelic
        joint with hippie chicks doing the Waft&amp;Wave dance that was so big
        in the 60s. Mosh pit.  An office where crooked promoters and record
        companies could rip off artists.

Subj:   Ten Ways to Really, Really Save the Earth

You're already separating paper and plastic, recycling bottles and taking
three-minute showers.  But is there more you can do to protect the
environment?  You bet!

1.  At the supermarket, try to pay with large denomination bills
whenever possible.  A twenty-dollar bill has the buying power of twenty
one-dollar bills, but uses only five percent of the forest resources.

2.  Get in the habit of referring to every locale as "this fragile
ecosystem."

3.  If you must own a large car, be sure to purchase one with tinted
glass.  Cars equipped with tinted glass stay three percent cooler
during the summer, making it possible to turn the air conditioning
down to the "medium" setting.

4.  If you see a spotted owl, don't kill it.  The meat tastes terrible
anyway.

5.  A single toilet flush consumes five to seven gallons of water, and
the solid waste adds to already overtaxed landfills.  "Holding it in"
remains a simple and effective way to protect the environment.

6.  Americans account for seven percent of the world's population, yet
consume 65% of the world's energy resources.  Apply for Swiss citizenship.

7.  The correct way to recycle a glass beverage container:  remove label,
setting aside tiny label remnants for recycling; rinse bottle with
reclaimed "grey" water; separate glass into five categories:  clear,
green, brown, long-neck and pony.

8.  One fewer wash load per month for every American translates to an
annual savings of 12.3 billion gallons of water, 23 million kilowatts
of electricity, and 15 fewer tons of phosphates.  Buy seven more pairs
of socks and underwear.

9.  Stop all "Ten Ways to Save the Earth" lists at #9.  Environmental
books and pamphlets consume more than 580 million trees every year and
account for more than half of the world's sanctimony.

        The current Atlantic Monthly has three pieces on endangered
        species.

        The first article argues that someone has to perform some triage.
        Triage, for the innocent, is one of the horrors of war.  Military
        doctors divide the wounded up into three groups:

                1.  Those who can't be saved.  Ease their pain and let them
                    die.

                2.  Those who will live anyway.  Ease their pain and let
                    them live.

                3.  Those who won't live unless something is done right
                    away.  Ease their pain and do it.

        At present, the Endangered Species Act concentrates entirely on
        category 1.  If they can be saved, it is at great cost.  Many in
        category 3 are ignored until they make it into category 1.

        The second article argues that the spotted owl is not the issue, it
        is saving environments like the forest primeval where hundreds of
        species, including the spotted owl, thrive.  The Enndangered
        Species Act forces attention in the wrong spot.

        The third article I haven'r read yet, but it appears to face up to
        the issue that we humans are animals who live on the earth too.

        At any rate, the Endangered Species Act is up for renewal next year
        and there's going to be a lot of talk about it, to be sure, so
        maybe you want to read up now.  The collective title of the three
        articles is "Playing God".

Subject: supermarkets on the right and left coasts

Having just moved back to Boston from the Bay Area I'm continually
struck by the contrast in in daily life, such as with supermarkets.

For instance, if you're looking for ethernet cable in Boston, you
_don't_ go to the local Fry's.  The Star Market (its equivalent,
pronounced "Stah Mahket") has no computer department, and if you ask
for it you get a very strange look.  They have a smaller selection of
potato chips, too.

However I'm impressed that both coasts have solved the rediculous
"paper vs plastic" debate.

In placid Palo Alto, if you ask for a bag of any sort at the local
Whole Foods you'll get a condecending stare for not bringing your own
unbleached canvas tote.

At Stah, they just put your groceries in a paper bag without asking.
But they put it in a plastic bag first!

Subj:   Desperados ride horses, right? Vacation ideas w/plenty of horsepower...

Ah, the autumn foliage - the crisp, cool air - the hills of Vermont in
September! And what a way to enjoy these things: riding sturdy little
Icelandic horses uphill and down, sometimes watching the scenery at a
leisurely pace, and other times seeing it as a blur while cantering across
a grassy field. And, after a day's riding, pulling up at a friendly inn,
where a deluxe meal awaits...

This was the mini-adventure that I joined some friends in last week, and a
jolly time it was - but it isn't for the sake of the glorious views or the
responsive little horses or the fabulous food that I'm writing this. No -
this trip was just the beginning of a whole new world of adventurous
vacations, and I felt compelled to share them.

In what I now perceive to be part of a diabolical plot, that friendly
little inn with the great food (and the hot, hot baths!) provided a lot
of reading material, too. Among this material was a catalog of equestrian
vacations - and thus were the victims enmeshed in the web.

"Riding Vacations Around the World" [compiled by FITS Equestrian, a travel
agency] lists horse-related vacation trips which range from pure luxury (a
few hours of riding from California vineyard to vineyard, interspersed
with stays at luxury inns complete with hot tubs) to pure disaster (see
"The Algerian Death Ride" a bit farther on). In England one can ride from
thatched cottages to Stonehenge to Avebury; in Ireland one can ride to
hounds, or just choose a horse and a map and go exploring; in France, the
Loire-Valley tour lets one ride from chateau to chateau. (And you'll
definitely _ride_; most of these tours are for 5 or 6 days, with several
lasting nearly two weeks, and with from 4 to 8 hours of riding per day.)

There's a tour in Kenya, in a game preserve [though I'd question the
wisdom of riding something that looks like food in the presence of lions];
or one can ride through the Alps [on horses - I didn't see any elephant
tours], or do an equestrian pub-crawl in Australia [I don't *think* the
horses get any beer]. There are tours in Russia, Iceland, Belize, Israel...
in fact, I think Antarctica was the only place that wasn't listed (and I
bet one could arrange a "Scott Memorial South Pole Pony Trek" if one were
completely lacking in sensitivity, said she innocently).

And for the truly ambitious riders, there are the expert-only tours. One
of these is the Luxor Tour in Egypt: described in the catalog as "really
an adventure," this sixteen-day tour features 4 to 7 hours of riding per
day, across the desert at full gallop much of the time. The ride covers
400 kms., from south of Giza to the Valley of the Kings.

        "The exact routing must be determined anew every year as
        landmarks and desert configurations change. It is not unusual
        to spend many hours in finding the next campsite. Since
        biblical times no riders on horses have crossed these areas
        and the welcome by the population is overwhelming."

[I bet it is. We were told of someone who'd tried this tour. She was
mounted on a very thin Arabian horse who immediately set out across the
desert at full gallop; after about 45 minutes of this, she fell off, and
had to watch as the others in the party, unable to stop their horses, sped
away into the distance...]

But the juiciest trip of all is what I think of fondly as the Algerian
Death Ride, known in the catalog as "The Great Sahara Ride":

        "You must love the desert, not be afraid of
        loneliness and hardship and be ready to share
        the simple life of the Berbers in order to
        participate on this ride. You must, furthermore, be
        a very experienced rider and in top physical condition
        because once you are in the Sahara there is
        little help and there is no backing out. On the
        other hand, there are few experiences in life
        which can compare in intensity with a week in
        the desert, riding fast Berber stallions with
        nothing but sand around and the sky above you. At
        night the absolute stillness and the dazzling
        brightness of the stars can not be found anywhere
        else on earth and maybe after a few nights you will
        begin to hear 'the desert sing'."

I just bet you will, too. The ride itself is six days of very fast-paced
travel, in the saddle 5-8 hours per day, with stops nightly at Berber huts.
Of the Berbers, the catalog says,

        "The hospitality of these isolated Berbers is legendary. Our
        riders are probably the only foreigners these people will ever
        see and of course they will do for you whatever they can,
        which is little."

Well, _that's_ comforting.

After all that, our little two-day jaunt through the Vermont hills looks
pretty trifling, but it was quite the fine time anyway, and I heartily
recommend it. (If interested, contact the Vermont Icelandic Horse Farm in
Waitsfield, VT, 802-496-7141.) In fact, some of us are starting to seriously
kick around the idea of going on one of the longer treks - though I think
we'll stick to those which feature nightly stops at places where hot baths
are available. At first, anyway.

And if anyone should happen to try one of those desert gallops, do let me
know how it was. ;-)

        Yes, the whole song is clearly directed at a man.  It turns out
        that the King copped his version from Freddie Bell and the
        Bellboys, legendary Las Vegas lounge act.  When the King first
        played Vegas, he was a complete flop.  The only fun he and the band
        had was hanging around watching Freddie Bell do his show.  When
        they went back to New York, they cut the record, chord for chord
        from Freddie's arrangement.  So maybe Freddie Bell and the Bellboys
        belong in the Hall o' Fame.  Or the Treniers, another HARD-rocking
        lounge act.  And, hey, how about the Rabbit Foot Minstrels and
        Silas Greene From New Orleans, two "black minstrel" shows?  These
        were travelling variety shows featuring black performers who played
        for (mostly) black audiences, not the strange and offensive "white
        minstrel" shows that dominated Americano show biz from like 1850
        tO 1925.  Just what the hell was that all about anyway?  Even black
        performers had to perform in blackface if they appeared before
        white audiences in those days.  What the hell *was* that all about?

Subj:   theoretical analysis of the trebuchet (see Desperado #3053)

    re the discussion of the trebuchet in Desperado #3053 (16 September 1991):

    I could not help but attempt a quickie analysis of the trebuchet.
    The dynamics of this problem are interesting.  After an abortive
    approach based on forces and gravitational acceleration, I dug out my
    freshman physics texts where the analysis of the motion of a pendulum was
    done based on conservation of energy considerations.  I adopted the same
    approach for the trebuchet and was much more successful.

    Consider the trebuchet as a see saw (or teeter totter as it is sometimes
    called).

    Let the weight box be of mass M, at distance r from the pivot, and the
    payload of mass m, at distance R from the pivot.  As described, we have

        R &gt; r and M &gt; m, with M*r &gt;&gt; m*R

    (otherwise the trebuchet doesn't work, or works "backwards").

    (Note that the casing convention uppercases the larger of the mass and
    moment arm values, rather than basing it on the driving mass vs the
    payload.  Sorry if this confuses you.)

    The total energy of the trebuchet is conserved, and is the sum of the
    kinetic and gravitational potential energies of the weight box and
    payload.  Ignore for simplicity the role of the trebuchet's beam itself.
    Note that the sling (assumed like the beam to be weightless and
    frictionless) does not have any effect on this conservation of energy
    argument.  The fact that the beam actually weighs three tons may have
    some bearing on the relevanc eof this analysis.

    Assume that the pivot is located a height r above the potential energy
    reference point.

    In the initial (cocked, horizontal) state, we have:

                         weight box              payload

    potential               M*g*r                 m*g*r

    kinetic                   0                     0

    In the final (moving at maximum velocity, vertical) state, we have:

                         weight box              payload

    potential                 0                 m*g*(r + R)

    kinetic               (M*v^2)/2              (m*V^2)/2

    Using the casing convention, v is the velocity of the weight box,
    V the velocity of the payload.  g is the acceleration due to gravity,
    9.8 meters/second/second.

    Because the entire trebuchet beam moves as one piece, we must have

        V = (R/r)*v

    Plugging all this in and solving for V (satisfy yourself that this is
    indeed the case), we get

        V^2 = 2*R^2*g*(M*r + m*R)/(M*r^2 + m*R^2)

    OK.  Now, working up some numbers from the description: the beam is
    as being 60 feet long.  Call it 20 meters and say r=3, R=17.  The weight
    box is described as holding 5 1/2 tons of steel bar; that's 11000 pounds
    or M = 30800 kg.  A 112 pound payload means m = 313 kg.

    Run these numbers and you get

        V = 38.8 m/sec, or about 127 ft/sec, or about 87 mph.

    As noted earlier, the sling cannot alter this velocity, so just assume
    the payload leaves the beam with this velocity, traveling horizontally.
    Ignoring aerodynamic drag, a body will fall

        h = (g*t^2)/2

    in t seconds, so it takes

        t = sqrt(h/(2*g))

    to fall a distance h.  The payload must fall 20 meters (the height at
    which it was released moving horizontally), so

        t = 2.02 seconds.

    During this time it will travel about 257 feet horizontally; the article
    claims this payload traveled 235 yards, or 705 feet.  What's wrong here?

    Well, a horizontal release is not optimal for range; ignoring drag,
    the maximum range will be achieved by releasing at a 45 degree angle
    of elevation.  For a 45 degree release, the vertical velocity is 90
    ft/sec, so the payload rises for 2.8 seconds and then falls for 2.8
    seconds.  During these 5.6 seconds the horizontal velocity is also
    90 ft/sec, so the payload travels 503 feet horizontally.  Better, but
    still not as described, especially considering this is a drag free
    analysis.

    Maybe the real trebuchet has more mechanical advantage.  Rerun the numbers
    with R = 18, r = 2.

    This gives us

        V = 43.6 m/sec, about 143 ft/sec or 97.5 mph.

    At the 45 degree release angle, the payload ascends for 3.144 seconds;
    the horizontal travel during ascent and descent is then 635 feet; now
    we're in the ball park.

    Some additional distance comes from the fact that the horizontal range
    in the above analysis is at the height of release; with the payload
    descending at about 45 degrees, you get almost another 60 feet from
    the height of the release point.  The sling can increase the release
    height, which would increase this effect, but at the expense of kinetic
    energy (which gets converted into potential energy the higher the sling
    carries the payload) and hence release velocity.  And of course, the
    sling has to release the payload at the optimum angle and at the velocity
    which ideally balances the range gain from release height with the range
    loss due to velocity loss to potential energy.

    How about the acceleration?  How long does it take the weight box to
    fall?  I was not able to work this out.  Naively, the weight box falls
    a distance h under the unimpeded influence of gravity, so for h = 3,

        t = 0.8 sec

    The payload accelerates from 0 to 38.8 m/sec in .8 sec, or an average
    acceleration of 48.5 m/sec/sec, or 4.95 gees.  Because the weight box
    actually falls more slowly, this represents an upper bound on the average
    acceleration, and I haven't tried to work out the peak acceleration.

    For h = 2, the unimpeded fall time t = 0.63 sec, and the upper bound
    on the average acceleration is 61.1 m/sec/sec, or 6.23 gees.

    These are pretty impressive average accelerations, even if they're only
    upper bounds.

The body collectors are proud of their unusual work.  They also believe
they earn valuable Buddhist "merit" by carrying the dead to the next
world.

"It makes me feel good and happy to get involved," said Bin "Top"
Banluerit, 29, who with his twin brother Akaphan "Tide", are famous Thai
actors nicknamed after popular detergent brands.  They moonlight three
nights a week as volunteer collectors.

The Thai media hail them as "Dynamic Duo Heart Throbs" and marvel at
their body snatching.

"When we were kids, we were very poor and we got clothes and other
things from charity, so now we want to pay society back by doing this
work," Top said.

Body collectors don't wear gloves.

"When maggots are coming out of the body, we wear rubber gloves," Top
said.

Many of the foundations collectors are poor volunteers--young men in
their late teens or early 20s who receive free room, board and pocket
money.

Several years ago, competition between the two biggest body-collecting
agencies became so fierce that street fights erupted at the scene over
who had the right to take the corpse.

BLACK MAGIC, 9 TO 5

&gt;From "The Office Witch," by Laurel Olsen, in the Beltaine 1991 issue of
the Lavender Pagan Newsletter, a quarterly published in Oakland,
California.  Beltaine is a pagan holiday that occurs on May 1.

The topic of the day is photocopiers, which have some pretty strange
things inside them that enhance their ability to catch and hold psychic
energy.  The corona wires, for example, are twenty-four-karat gold, and
some of the lenses can take a "charge" as well as a crystal can.  so
obviously, copiers are very sensitive to negativity; frequent breakdowns
are the result.

My solution is to hang a totem behind the copier to attract all the
loose, unfocused energy that is directed at the machine.  I take four
one-inch-wide strips of black construction paper and string them
together with cotton twine.  With my glue stick, I draw a
counterclockwise circle on each strip.  (The glue stick is the wand that
binds the spell.)  Every two weeks or so I put up a new circle.  I take
the old one to a public waste receptacle at a busy intersection near
work, dump it in, and go on my way WITHOUT LOOKING BACK.

While nothing except divine intervention can make a copier completely
breakdown-proof, what this spell does is alter the energy in the room
where the copier is located.  Users have a calmer attitude, and
breakdowns due to "operator error" are reduced to nil.

        syndrome.  They watch him every day."  The swimming fellow was
        outraged, "Yeah, I could work, but they tell me I'll have to take
        minimum wage and that would cost me money!"  "Millions of people
        live on minimum wage," says the reporter.  "Not me!"

        Caught another show called "Best of the Worst":  man who stops an
        electric fan with his tongue; men who make cole slaw with a
        lawnmower balanced on one's nose; then both of them shoot roll
        after roll of toilet paper (over the top, of course) forty feet in
        the air using leaf blowers; with the warning notice for all these
        acts, "Do not try this at home, even if you are extremely stupid".

        But, of course, I watch very little TV.
