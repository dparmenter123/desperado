Subject:  Home terminals and phones

A LITTLE BACKGROUND

     About a year ago, I got a terminal and modem to use at home,  and
I  innocently  asked  Wayne  Blair  about how to go about dialing into
computers in New Hampshire from my home in  the  Boston  area  without
going  broke.   He, being in the same boat, had been collecting a list
of such Boston-area people at MK, and had about 15 people on the list.
I  volunteered to help, and after prodding a few people at ZK the list
was soon up around 50.  We started looking into ways  to  improve  the
service  we get, and I soon found that in true DEC fashion ("You touch
it, you own it") that I had become a lightning rod for whatever  needs
and  complaints  people have in this area.  My purpose in writing this
little piece is to let a larger audience know, in one place,  what  we
can reasonably accomplish and what the real stumbling blocks are.

     If I have 50 people on my list of long-distance terminal users, I
would  guess  that  there are probably twice that number in MK and ZK,
using the rule of thumb that  for  every  person  I  know  of  there's
another I don't know about.  (I haven't actively looked for new people
for about 6 months.)  When I took my survey last year,  probably  half
of the people who responded had some kind of gripe with the way things
are currently handled.  If I can make a  generality,  the  gripes  all
boil  down  to this:  "If they can give me a VT100 and a modem to take
home, why can't they provide a reasonable connection for  me  from  my
home  to  my system?" With about a hundred people grumbling, we really
do deserve answers to our questions.  I'll break this  paper  up  into
answering the following questions:

      o  What's so hard about it?

      o  Who are "they", anyway?

      o  What can be done using what's available?

      o  What could make things better?

THE PROBLEM

     If your home is within the local calling area  of  your  system's
location, you generally have no problem.  (When the AT&amp;T breakup takes
effect in January 1984, local calling rates may  go  way  up  and  all
calls  may be charged by time, but that's another issue that everybody
will have to face in the long run.)  If  you're  rich,  you  can  dial
direct and pay for the long-distance call, but then you probably don't
have to work at DEC in the first place.  So, if you're like  the  rest
of us, you need some substitute for making direct calls.

     As I discuss below ("THE METHODS") there are several ways you can
have  DEC  provide  the  long-distance  part  of  a phone call to your
system.  The common problems that  these  methods  may  have  are  the
following:

      o  DEC doesn't intend its voice circuits to be  tied  up  during
         regular  working hours by data calls that use a line for many
         minutes or hours.

      o  Whenever DEC spends money, it wants to know what cost  center
         to  bill the expense to.  In general, it's difficult to get a
         location  with  many  cost  centers  (e.g.,  ZK)  to  provide
         facility-wide services.

      o  Digital data communications is  still  in  its  infancy,  and
         there  is no real alternative to using the existing telephone
         system (public and private) to connect  remote  terminals  to
         computers.

THE PLAYERS

     YOU:  I presume that you have a terminal and a modem at home that
DEC has given you.  Also, you should have some kind of unlimited local
service so that you don't pay for connect time.

     YOUR COST CENTER:  They decide whether you  get  a  terminal  and
modem, and they also decide whether you get any extra equipment.  They
can decide to provide you with a credit card or to let  you  bring  in
phone  bills.   There  is no fixed policy on what, if anything, a cost
center has to provide in this area.

     THE PHONE COMPANY (colloquially known  as  "TPC"):  They  provide
the  physical  means  of  connecting your modem to one at or near your
system, and they decide (in cahoots  with  the  government)  what  the
rules  are  for connecting to and being charged for use of the system.
TPC has traditionally provided mainly voice  service,  which  requires
relatively  high  bandwidth (about 3 kHz) and which assumes that there
is usually some kind of signal traveling across the connection  (i.e.,
either   you  talk  or  you  listen  to  somebody  else  talk).   Data
communications are very different from voice.  In a  given  burst,  at
1200  baud,  you can need as much bandwidth as voice, but in a typical
data (i.e., terminal) session you probably spend 90% or  more  of  the
time with no information at all traveling across the connection, while
you think, read, go to the john, etc.  TPC doesn't see it that way, of
course,  because  to  transmit digital data over circuits intended for
analog voice requires that you modulate  the  digits  onto  an  analog
signal,  the  carrier (the high-pitched whistle you hear when you make
the connection).  The carrier is always present, so as far as  TPC  is
concerned  you're  hogging  the  complete connection.  By the way, TPC
includes not only AT&amp;T and its component operating companies, but also
GT&amp;E,  MCI,  Sprint,  and all the other competitors that have appeared
recently.

     DATA NETWORKS:  There are a couple of world-wide networks (TYMNET
and  Telenet)  intended  strictly  for  moving digital data.  They are
based on the concepts, first developed in  Arpanet,  known  as  packet
switching.   The  basic  idea  is  to  realize  that any one user on a
digital network has a very low  information  bandwidth,  as  discussed
above,  so  that  it  makes  sense  to  multiplex together a number of
digital data streams over a single analog carrier.  I  won't  go  into
the  details  of how it works here, but you should know that there are
at least these two networks which  exist  and  are  supposed  to  make
money.   One  advantage  of  digital networks is that they can provide
error detection and correction to avoid the garbage you sometimes  get
from an analog modem connection.

     DEC'S PRIVATE PHONE SYSTEMS:  Yes, you think that there  is  only
one  DTN,  but  DEC actually has several means for providing different
types of phone service:

      o  "Local" service:  When you dial just an extension for a phone
         within  your  own  building or area (e.g., ZK to MK, or ML to
         PK) you can assume  that  the  call  is  handled  within  the
         switchboard for your area.

      o  DTN:  This is "long distance" service to most  of  the  large
         U.S.   facilities.   DEC doesn't really own its own telephone
         lines, but because it has such a large volume of  calls  over
         certain  routes it is able to get discount rates from TPC for
         calls over those routes.  When you make a DTN call (it begins
         with  an  8) the DTN "system" selects the best route for your
         call to take via the discount routes.

      o  Interface to TPC:  Whatever calls can't  go  completely  over
         DTN  routes  have  to be routed via the lowest cost way using
         regular TPC lines.  There are several ways for DTN  to  avoid
         having to pay regular long-distance rates:

          -  Foreign Exchange (FX) lines:  There  are  certain  routes
             where  DEC  doesn't  have  offices at both ends but where
             there is a  large  predictable  volume  of  calls  (e.g.,
             between  Maynard  and the Boston area).  What DEC does in
             this case is pay TPC for a  certain  number  of  reserved
             lines to be available between the given end-points of the
             route.  (In the  Maynard-Boston  example,  there  are  74
             lines.)  Because TPC is spared the need to bill each call
             separately, it gives DEC a flat rate on the line that  is
             much  lower than the expected cost of long distance calls
             would be, provided these lines are  heavily  used.   (The
             MK-Cambridge   lines   cost   $240/month   each.   That's
             $12/business day, or $1.50/business hour.  Even if a line
             is  busy  only  25%  of  the  time,  that works out to 10
             cents/minute compared to 26 cents/minute  for  a  regular
             daytime  call.)   These lines are called Foreign Exchange
             (FX) lines because there must be a dedicated phone number
             representing the non-DEC (foreign) end of a group of such
             lines.  (The Boston-area end  of  the  Maynard-Boston  FX
             group  has  an Arlington number, which many of the people
             on my interest list are familiar with.)  DEC intends that
             its  FX  lines  be used for outgoing calls only, at least
             during business  hours,  although  since  the  lines  can
             handle  calls  in  both directions it is possible to call
             into them from the  foreign  end.   This  restriction  to
             outgoing  calls  is handled by simply refusing to forward
             any calls during the day, since all incoming calls go  to
             the Maynard switchboard.

          -  WATS lines:  When DTN can't complete a call via  its  own
             lines,  plus  FX  lines,  it then tried to place the call
             over one of a number of WATS lines that DEC pays TPC for.
             WATS lines are more expensive that FX lines but are still
             cheaper that per-call long distance.

          -  Long distance:  When all else fails DTN places  the  call
             as a regular long distance call.  Clearly it is a goal of
             DTN to minimize this.

          -  Terminal  Switching  Network  (TSN):  This  is  how   DEC
             provides  a packet-switching network.  Actually, DEC uses
             TYMNET for  its  long-distance  connections,  and  TYMNET
             gives DEC a discount for the large volume that results.

      o  DEC CORPORATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS:  These are the  people  who
         are  responsible for providing the various services described
         above in a cost-effective way.   There  are  essentially  two
         kinds of Telecomm people:

          -  Technical types who know all about  all  kinds  of  phone
             service.

          -  Bean counters who worry about  who's  going  to  pay  for
             what.

         One service that Telecomm provides is the switch.  This is  a
         machine  (one  in  each  building,  usually) which provides a
         bunch of modems on one side and a bunch of connections to all
         the  computers  in the building on the other.  Its purpose is
         to keep from having each computer have  its  own  modems  and
         phone numbers.  It normally works fine (each ZK switch has 30
         modems, and during a normal business day the maximum  use  is
         about  15) until there is an unusual condition such as a snow
         day and hundreds of people try to dial in.  Then  the  switch
         gets full.

THE METHODS

     So, given all the confusing options listed above, how do YOU  get
from  your  home  phone  to  your  system?   The  decision is based on
tradeoffs among convenience, cost, politics, and performance:

     DIRECT DIAL:  As I said above, unless you're rich enough  not  to
have  to  work  for DEC, you don't want to dial each call yourself and
pay for it.  Many people do dial each call, however, and  bring  their
phone  bills  in  for  reimbursement  from  petty  cash.   I have seen
people's bills of over  $200/month,  which  is  ridiculous  given  the
alternatives,  but some cost center managers will somehow swallow this
without asking what else can be done.

     CREDIT CARD:  Some cost centers give people credit cards so  that
people  don't  have to face the costs themselves.  This doesn't really
differ from direct dail, except in slightly higher cost with  slightly
greater convenience.

     FX LINES:  The DEC switchboards will answer incoming calls on  FX
lines  after  hours  and on weekend, tranferring the calls to whatever
DTN number you wish.  (The operator or guard will usually  ask  for  a
charge,  i.e.   your  office  DTN,  or  else  for  your badge and cost
center.)  The reasoning is that DEC is paying for the FX  line  anyway
and it would otherwise sit unused outside of business hours.  FX lines
serve only certain areas, and they do not help you if you want to work
from home during business hours.

     SITE-OFF-PREMISES (SOP) LINES:  This is  like  having  an  office
extension  phone in your home.  A typical cost I have seen is $120 for
Framingham to Marlboro, so the cost is in the ballpark of having  your
own  FX line.  I guess some people have been able to justify this, and
it can be cheaper than directly billing calls, but it's still a lot of
money and hardly a common solution.

     DEC  INTERNAL  NETWORKS:  Some  people  have  been  able  to  get
accounts  on systems that are local to their homes.  They can then use
the engineering network or some other  DEC  network  to  complete  the
connection.   For  example, if you can get an account on a MR node and
you live locally to MR, you're all set.  Two  drawbacks:   There's  no
formal  way  to  get  such  accounts, and DEC facilities tend to be in
remote places like Maynard and Spit Brook.  There are no nodes  within
a local call of the Boston area.  (It would be a possible solution for
the Boston area to put a small computer [with many telephone lines] in
an office somewhere in the area and connect it to the engineering net.
Then you could log in  via  a  local  call  and  use  remote  terminal
services  to  log in to your own computer.  Unfortunately, even though
the computer could log each user for charging to cost centers, getting
DEC to make the capital investment up front seems like a pretty remote
dream.)

     TSN:  Technically, you can get access from anywhere in the  world
via  TYMNET.  But first your cost center needs a TSN account (and some
managers balk at this), next you need to be within local  call  access
of  either a TSN node (there is one in Waltham) or a TYMNET node (most
major cities but not in the boondocks), and you  need  to  go  through
several  procedures to make the connection to your system.  If there's
not a TSN node at your destination (and there isn't one yet in ZK) you
have  to go via a "dialer" node in PK that places part of the call via
DTN.  This defeats part of the reason for having  a  digital  network,
and  there  are also very few such dialers.  TSN charges mainly by the
number of characters sent and received, 5  cents  per  1K  characters.
This  can  add  up  in  a  hurry if you're doing some heavy editing or
program development.  (Each time you hit CTRL-W in the editor  with  a
full  screen,  it  can  cost  a  dime.)  TSN  is  really  intended for
low-volume users like salesmen who want to dial in and enter an  order
or  do  a  demo.  Another problem with TSN is that it doesn't send and
echo each character as you type  it;   instead  it  waits  for  enough
characters  to  make  it worth sending a packet (there is a timeout so
that you don't have to wait forever), and there is a noticeable lag of
several characters as you type.

     REVERSING THE CHARGES:  This is an attractive idea:  How can  you
get  your computer to call you, rather than having you place the call?
There are several ways that you can try:

      o  From home, call your  secretary  or  somebody  else  in  your
         group,  and  tell whoever answers to call you back.  When you
         answer, have the person then transfer their end of  the  call
         (yes,  they  originated it, but at least at ZK it is possible
         to transfer the originating end of a call) to the  number  of
         your location's switch.  The modem at the switch will whistle
         at you and you can  complete  the  connection  at  your  home
         modem.   The  call  is charged to the phone number from which
         the call was originally made (the person who called you back)
         even  though  that  number  is  not  involved  in  the  final
         connection and is free for other uses, and the call  will  be
         charged  within your cost center.  Of course, this works only
         if somebody is around to field your original call, and you do
         have to pay for that unless they will accept a collect call.

      o  Get hold of a DF03-AC modem or  equivalent  (that's  a  modem
         with  auto-originate).   Put  it in your office, connected to
         your office phone and to  a  direct  terminal  line  to  your
         computer.   (This  doesn't work if your terminal line goes to
         the switch.) Then you log in from home by any of the  methods
         described  above;   even  if you have to dial a long-distance
         call, it'll only be a 1-minute call to pay for.  When you get
         logged  in,  you kick off a batch job that attaches itself to
         the direct terminal line and causes the modem  to  dial  your
         home  phone number.  You hang up immediately and wait for the
         phone to ring.  Your home modem will complete  the  call  and
         you'll  be directly connected to your computer (no need to go
         through the switch).  The call is then billed to your  office
         phone.   This works;  I use it.  (I can provide a copy of the
         DCL command file that I use for the batch job.) The  problem,
         of  course,  is  getting  a modem to keep in your office when
         you're not there.  (You also have to remember to  switch  the
         modem  to  DATA  when  you leave each evening, and to be sure
         it's connected to the terminal line.)  Now,  if  you  already
         have  a terminal and a modem at home, that's an investment of
         several hundred dollars at transfer cost, so  another  couple
         of  hundred dollars for a modem is in the noise.  Still, this
         solution is limited to people whose cost centers  have  extra
         DF03-ACs around.

      o  A generalized version of the above would be to have a PRO-350
         with  the  Telephone Management System (TMS) option.  One PRO
         could support an entire facility.  You would dial the  number
         the  TMS  is connected to, identify yourself, and give it the
         number to call back to.   It  would  then  (with  the  proper
         program)  call your home number and transfer its local end to
         your switch.  It would then be free to accept  another  call.
         It  could  also  keep  records of each call so that each call
         could be billed to the appropriate cost center.  The cost  of
         maintaining  the  PRO itself could be added as a tax onto the
         billing of the calls.  The  problems  here  are  (1)  getting
         facilities  to  commit  to  supporting this idea, (2) getting
         appropriate software, (3) getting the hardware  (TMS  is  not
         yet  in  production),  and  (4) it still goes via the switch,
         with the problem of running out of lines when it snows.

THE FUTURE

     It's going to be several years before there  is  a  good  general
solution to this problem.  There is always the bottleneck of using the
telephone company's voice lines to transmit digital data, and  there's
plenty  of internal inertia to deal with too.  Alternate systems, such
as channels on cable TV, are in the dim future.  The  bottom  line  is
that if people at a location apply enough pressure and complain loudly
enough, some improvements can be made.

DEC recently tried letting us use the FX lines in the daytime.  They
wanted to see if there was any need for the service.  They found that
the lines were heavily used.  So they cancelled the experiment.

Some people from RSX took a company plane to Long Island a few months
ago.  We were joking with the pilot about how he probably only saw
vice presidents and so forth, but this time he had a planeful of
workers.  He said, No, that most of the passengers on DEC planes were
just plain employes who worked in one place and had a need to be
somewhere else.  We talked on for awhile and he pointed out that DEC
has a big investment in internal communications.  Not only do we have
an airline, but we have a hot phone system, commuter vans, regular
vans, the engineering net, magazines, newsletters, brochures, etc.
The reason we have that money tied up is because we do believe in
distributed processing, not only as a product, but also as a way of
doing our work.  It seems a great gap in that strategy and that way of
life to have so much money tied up in home equipment and not to have
any reliable, organized, company-wide, high-tech way of using it.

I think we could all be getting at least 4800 baud service if DEC
would get behind it.

Regarding the discounted Personal Computer offers, it is true that DEC is
quite 'good' to its employees with the discount on the various machines.  What
is sometimes overlooked is the fact that repair costs ARE NOT discounted.
In the case of the recent PDT offer, some people have had a repair bill
greater than the cost of the original discounted system.  And with the
number of hardware problems encountered with the PRO 350 (at least internally)
the old saying holds true:    Let the buyer beware (or be stuck).

Subject: PCs for Freshmen at Stevens Institute of Technology

Many of you may already know that all Freshmen at Stevens are required
to buy DEC PCs.

The INN news night before last showed the students unpacking and
assembling the Professional, told of the $1800 price they are paying,
quoted students as saying, "We're getting a SUPER Computer," and
showed one PC with the screen lit up with a hardware failure diagram.

Well, it's a pretty picture, and few people watching the news would
have known that the picture meant something was wrong.

The game is for real.  It's actually called DECman.  I saw it running on
a DECmate I at the DEC store in Manchester a few months ago.  Perhaps it
is too realistic; after the Apple, IBM and Wang ghosts stomp on the DECman
too often, the game is over...

The World Government  of  the  Age  of  Enlightenment  announces  its

regardless of the magnitude and nature of the  problem  -  political,

capitalism, communism, socialism, democtacy, or dictatorship.

Governments are invited to contract with the World  Gov...  to  solve
their problems on the basis of cost reimbursement after the target is
reached.

1983 can be the year of fulfilment for every government.

Subject: A real STINKER

I've been reading about rat riddance with great amusement (and education.  One
never knows when one might have the same problem).  Here's another varmint
problem for your readers.  Can anyone help?  A skunk has been visiting my
yard regularly for the last month or so.  Not only does it tear up the lawn
digging for grubs (or whatever they dig for), if the prevailing breeze is
from that side of the house....pass me the Air-Wick.  Any ideas?

    Ground rule:  solutions must cause the skunk to GO AWAY!

    Exception:  anyone who is willing to remove the skunk may ignore this
    rule.  No solution involving a skunk of the opposite sex will be
    considered.

An old gent I met many years ago suggested the following way to get rid of
rats:

  Feed them a mixture of grated cheese and plaster of Paris.

Subject: RE: to die in Paris

I'd like to thank all of you who've gone to the trouble of sending me
such entertaining and witty suggestions for getting rid of rodents.

I especially like two suggestions:

(1)  Cut up a few Polish sausages and leave them in likely places where
     the heretofore unidentified rodent frequents.  Then bait a mouse
     trap with two Maalox tablets!

(2)  Concoct a careful mixture of plaster of Paris and cheese and leave it
     in similar likely places along with plenty of water.  Cute little
     statues should soon appear the apartment.

Truly the products of engineering minds, eh?

I have to tell you that it is or was a mouse.  It may have died of suspense
waiting for me to choose a method.  Or from boredom since I haven't been
home much lately.  If not, I am now well-armed for creative combat.

I had the idea myself to leave little pieces of Ex-Lax around but decided
against it.

Just the same, though, the little critter(s) may still be there when I return
tonight.  So keep those cards and letters coming in.

Here are some people who asked to be added to the Desperado list.  Due
to a bug whereby DECnet won't tell an RSX system a node name, I don't
know where they're from.  Let me know and I'll get them on the list.

Thanks, by the way, to CASTOR::COVERT who put in some time helping get
the list adjusted to Phase IV of DECnet.  Some of you who've been
getting random service should see an improvement.
