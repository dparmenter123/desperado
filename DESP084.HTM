Noted Desperado Larry Bohn made his release date faster than VMS. Today is
his last day.  Larry, better known to Desperados as DELPHI::BOHN,
started one of the most successful numbers in Desperado history, the
"the check is in the mail" collection.  Here, for the first time under
one roof, are all 64 of the often-said-but-never-true remarks.

Keep your mask on, Larry.

And here's an invitation to Larry's party.  If you don't know him,
come and meet him.  They need the money to pay the two bands.  This is
going to be an above average party.  One of the bands is The
Dogmatics.  The other is the Del Fuegos, according to a rumor I am now
starting..

I was driving home on 495 a few days ago when I came up behind an
ordinary-looking Oldsmobile with the Mass. license plate EROS.  I pushed
on eagerly, not knowing whether to expect Suzanne Somers or perhaps
someone dressed in chains.  Turned out that it was an ordinary-looking,
bored, past-middle-aged man in very unremarkable clothes...

One of the best, subtle licence plates I know:

        On a California Honda Accord:

                4X4X8

but I doubt Californians know what a cord is!

More license plates, etc.

        URABUS    -- on a Subaru

        U+IR1     -- on another mushy car

        BLK4ST    -- on a black BMW

Also, one day I saw a 2-line bumper sticker.  The first line was

        Diesel gas makes me horny.

Anyone know what the second line is?  (We weren't close enough to the car
to be able to read the smaller print.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The second line says

                Meet me at such-and-so truck stop.

These were both on one garbage truck at the corner of the D.W. Highway
and Spit Brook Rd.
