        "All burr and no eat-o?" John inquired.

by bare buttocks and the slogan read "Naked in Massachusetts".

Subject: Red dye #1

The following is a paraphrased excerpt from the sign at the flamingo exhibit
at the Phoenix zoo.  (The sign gives interesting little tidbits about the
flamingo, like what its natural habitat is, and, most interestingly, its diets
in the natural environment and while residing in Phoenix:)

        Zoo diet:  ... dog food ... and a commercially prepared dye which
                   helps retain the flamingo's pink coloring which quickly
                   fades while in captivity.

Is this part of the Food and Drug Administration's "truth in packaging" rules?

Is it true that zoo flamingos contain no natural ingredients?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
This makes it sound like the flamingos eat natural dye when they're
out in the wilds.  Actually, the dietary ingredient that the Phoenix
flamingos are missing is shrimp.  Shrimp keep flamingos pink.

These expressively named birds also have complicated sex lives.  When
they changed the racing season at Hialeah Park in Miami, the flamingos
stopped laying eggs.

I believe the expression "bought the farm" dates back to the First World War.
I have always assumed it is a black-humored variant on the antique shop
principle, "If you break it, you've bought it."  A pilot cratering the back
forty has damaged the farm and, hence, has bought it.

One of the mysteries of business . . . One of the many mysteries of
business is how one company can make money selling something that
another company loses money on.  DEC can't--apparently--make money
selling to individuals, and yet, individuals keep coming to us with
money in hand and getting run off.  Surely there must be some hotshot
in DEC sales who's willing to quit and open a computer stand on Route
27 in Maynard to deal with disappointed would-be DEC customers.

About DEC's sales tactics--there is a number in Parker Street called
Customer Assistance; employees are supposed to refer customers to this
number if the employee happens to get a call from a customer and either
can't or doesn't have the time to answer it.  The number is 223-7161
(or, 617-493-7161).  According to the blurb in the latest issue
of Digital This Week, "The staff is trained to assure customer satisfaction
and good customer relations."  What does this actually mean?  Your guess
is as good as mine.

There is also a place in Merrimack called the Employee Referral Control
Center, located at MK1-1/1EM (I don't have a phone number).  This is where
you are supposed to send the little cards inside the DECmate promotion
brochure.  Presumably, these people know how to deal with customers with
money in their hands.

I am very much aware that DEC is going to have to change its way of
selling computers.  The computer stores are a good idea, but I've
heard radically different stories about them.  There is one in the
sunbelt (Pheonix or Albuquerque) that is supposed to be doing a land-office
business in DECmates.  However, a lawyer friend of mine went into the
store in downtown Boston, and was thoroughly rebuffed, and as a result,
will not even consider dealing with DEC (they are looking at Apple and IBM
right now; but I'm told that IBM is every bit as bad as DEC, so they're
dealing with Sears in Burlington).

Subject: The woes of the lower classes...

The DCL hack that was included in #1006, I am informed, was not necessary to
the peace of mind of one of my subdistributees.  he has just visited me with
the wrath of some kind of plebeian god, consisting of a severe thrashing  a-
bout the head and shoulders.   It seems that this poor soul (?) is possessed
of (or perhaps "by") a VT52, which the said hack very kindly puts  into  the
operating  mode  referred to in the manual as "strange" mode, more generally
known as OIW (off in the weeds) mode.  I am requested, therefore, to suggest
that all future hacks of like nature be typed out on  someone's  VT52 before
they are put into the mail.   After all, wasn't that why they put VT52  mode
into the VT100?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The arbitrary rule:

                All Desperados have VT100s.

I'll bet that you could list 48 differences (100-52) between a real
VT52 and "VT52" mode on the VT100.

The best way to cure a VT52 down with escape-sequence disease is a few
dozen CTRL/Zs followed by turning it off and on a half-dozen times.

Yet more on Indians:

As anyone who phantoms the remainder tables knows, Willard Espy is the
last word on words.  Mr. Espy turns out volume after volume of etymology
for the millions, and as far as I know has never once sold one for list
price.  If you like to read about word origins, you might look for some
of his books in second hand book stores or the three for a dollar table
of you favorite bookseller.

All this leads up to Espy on Indians.  According to friend Willard, the
term Indian Giver started with a curious custom where if an Indian gave
you a gift, he would take it back if you did not give him one in return.
Marketeers do a similar thing with business cards.  Indian Sign supposedly
refers to a hand gesture that Indians used to ward off evil.  Probably
like the Italians in the North End of Boston use to this day.

Another bit of word trivia which I bring up every year about this time
deals with the verb "to snow" and the value of a Boston education.
The school board in the city of Boston feels that for an education to be
good, it must be properly archaic.  Therefore, anyone from Boston knows
"to snow" is like the verb "to know" and runs "snow snew snown."  This
knowlege has limited value, since if you go around saying "It snew last
night" you'll only get a reputation as an eccentric.  On the other hand,
every time you hear someone say "It snowed last night" you'll cringe.

Subject: but irregardless of that, nevertheless

Idiom is what those phrases are, all right, just like "irregardless."
And if we can use those, why not spell privilege with whatever vowels
fall to hand?

-de-

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
One answer is that people do spell privilege with whatever vowels come
to hand, and yet, we always know what they mean.  Even Japanese hi-fi
instructions are completely understandable.  Naturally, I don't write
that way, and neither does DELPHI::ELFSTROM.  We write Standard
American English the best we know how, but meanwhile, all around us,
like it or not, nonwriters are trying to turn "irregardless" into a
word.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  "Ain't" was
slangy and casual when it first appeared in English 400 years ago and
it's still slangy and casual.  "Mob" was slangy and casual when it
appeared in the language a couple of hundred years ago, and careful
writers refused to use it, but it is now perfectly good language. "Mob"
is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase mobile vulgus, meaning "the
movable common people" and I guess the objection of the careful
writers was that it wasn't their movability that was objectionable,
but their vulgarity.  Perhaps they would have accepted the term
"vulg".  "Decimate" used to mean "kill every tenth man" and it was a
punishment inflicted on disgraced Roman legions, but now it means
"kill a lot of them".

Furthermore, I don't believe in parts of speech, or sentence diagrams.

From: SPIDER::COLLIER
To:   ALIEN::PARMENTER
Subject: Babbage and music

Babbage did indeed fulminate extensively, and more than crankily, against
street musicians.  This is now usually perceived as simple eccentricity,
but his views were fairly widely shared by his contemporaries, who argued
that these musicians were a geunuine public nuisance.  Imagine that people
wandered around the corridors near your office all day playing obnoxious
music on the accordion (or substitute some other instrument you dislike),
and expecting you to toss quarters to them.  Babbage's London was not
characterised by large hermetically sealed buildings that isolated people
from street noise.

It is indeed true that Babbage could be cranky or worse, in letters and
elsewise, when he thought others were being pig-headed, small-brained,
or self-serving.  This was aften highly useful.  His 'Decline of Science
in England . . .', for example, was pure crankiness to the nth degree,
directed at a moribund Royal Society; its publication was an important
instrument in the reform movement that led to the founding of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science (model in turn for AAAS).  It
is also true that toward the end of his life crankiness played a somewhat
larger and more self-sustaining role in his behavior, due to disappointments
large and small, and simply to old age.  This is when street musicians
became prevalent, and the relevant letters were penned.

As to his reaction to synthesizers, it would most likely have been
complete disregard.  Music seems to have interested him not at all,
and it is one of the few areas of human endeavor to which he made no
significant contribution, though he is now remembered almost entirely
for his most stunning feat, the invention of the general purpose digital
computer.  In practical terms he was far more influential in other ways:
as a pioneer of scientific organization, operations research, statistical
analysis of public affairs, and a rational actuarial basis of the
life insurance industry.  He and a few peers helped pull British mathematics
out of the 17th century.  And he contributed to myriad other areas as
diverse as the introduction of artificial theatrical lighting and the
invention of coded occultations for lighthouses so that they could
be identifiable from ships at sea.  Lastly, he was by no means the
eccentric recluse people sometimes picture (again, somewhat excepting
the end of his life).  During his middle years, he was a great social lion,
and invitations to his huge weekly parties were among the most sought-after
in London.

Finally, 'ere the flame dies, Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, was NOT
a programmer in any sense at all (let alone the first), and made NO
contribution to the design of the Analytical Engine or the construction
of algorithms with which it would solve problems.  Rather she was
quite successfully used by Babbage to publicize his machine, and he
was determined (for complex reasons) not to publish anything under his
own name.  He did not even meet Ada until nearly a decade after the
invention of the A.E., and she played a very small role in his life.
If you want to see cranky letters, read some of hers.  She was plagued
by illness, and on medical instruction often remained high on both
morphine and brandy.  She had real gambling problems, but they had
no connection to Babbage.  Her life, in short, would far more suitably
be written up in the National Enquirer than in the Transactions of the ACM.
She also did not invent 'bells and whistles'.

I find it unlikely that anyone is waiting for a review in Desperado

difference between Diet Coke and Tab?" here's a Tab-drinker's view on
it:

        Diet Coke is to Tab as Pepsi is to Coke.  That is to say that
Diet Coke's flavour is not as strong as Tab's, but otherwise they are
similar.  Or they were similar.  A few Days after Diet Coke came out, I
noticed that all the Tab I bought had a distinctly root beer flavour to
it.  I don't know if the bottler forgot to wash the nozzles before
bottling the Tab (remember, Coke is responsible for that foul slime
called Fanta Root Beer) or if they have meddled with the Tab formula to
move part of their market onto Diet Coke.  The ways of marketeers are
dark and devious.

Subject: Diet Coke and Pepsi Free

Diet Coke????  I wasn't aware cocaine had any appreciable caloric value....

Pepsi Free is simply the Pepsi Cola formula without any (or perhaps just with
less) caffeine.  In the good ole days, cola drinks used to be a powerful
stimulant.  Cola is made from the second extract of leaves of the coca plant,
after the cocaine is extracted.  The original drink still had trace amounts
of cocaine.  This is why Coca Cola was the "pause that refreshes."  When
cocaine was outlawed, they switched over to caffeine to provide the kick.
The FDA still requires X amount of caffeine in anything calling itself a cola.
This is why "Pepsi Free" doesn't have the word "cola" anywhere in its name.

The classic description of New Hampshire seasons is:

        Nine months of winter and three months of hard sledding.

                ---------------------------------------

My candidate for the official DESPERADO dictionary is "Chamber's."  It is
the semi-standard dictionary for serious word game and puzzle fans, probably
because of its complement of obscure, archaic, and Scottish words as well as
its compact size and reasonable cost.  A very good choice if you like the
British-style cryptic crossword puzzles, as I do.

                ---------------------------------------

The phrase you parodied a recent DESPERADO, "When guns are outlawed, only
outlaws will have guns", has always struck me as one of those meaningless,
tautological phrases.  Clearly if guns are outlawed, every gun owner is then
an outlaw and hence only outlaws will have guns.

Of course, advertising is a rich source of words and phrases that seem to mean
something but don't.  One that always irritates me is usually delivered in a
pompous and stentorian manner, "BUY &lt;product-name&gt;, IT MAY BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING YOU DO TODAY."  I generally reply, calmly and quietly, "And
then again, maybe not."

An common advertising tautology is "at participating dealers". In other words,
"You can get it where you can get it and where you can't, you can't".
"Void where prohibited" is in the same class. Yet another is "nothing is better
than &lt;product-name&gt;"; translation, "we're no better than the rest."

                ---------------------------------------

Your use of the word "matriculate" reminded me of a form of word-play that
combines politics, logophilia and double-entendre. I refer to what I call the
"Smather", a political attack consisting of a factually correct statement,
incorporating a somewhat obscure word, phrased in such a way as to give an
erroneous impression to someone unfamiliar with the word.

For example, one politician alluded to his opponent's sister "who was a
thespian up in New York City."  A university was attacked by saying that
it was a place where "boys and girls matriculated together" and where "a girl
was required to show a professor her thesis."  (The were many more of these
university oriented ones; I wish I could remember the others.)

The name honors (?) Ex-senator George Smathers of Florida who is popularly
credited with making statements like these.  How many are really his and how
many were made up by journalists in Washington bars, I don't know.

Mike.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Senator Smathers's victim was Senator Claude Pepper, whom he also
denominated "Red Pepper" in honor of Pepper's liberal views.  Smathers
really did pull all of this stuff in the 1952 election and there was
nothing Pepper could do about it.  Pepper lost the election, but
bounced back as a House member, where he serves to this day.  He is
particularly noted as a champion of the elderly.  He is 82 and still
full of fun.
