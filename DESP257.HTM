 DESPERADO, Circle the globe with whimsy and daring

 Don't miss the Peter Cook obituary in last week New Yorker, many a
 laugh, of course, as that was his trade and hardly anyone plied it
 any better.

 He didn't like the title of "Bedazzled".  He wanted to call it
 "Raquel Welch", so it could be billed as "Peter Cook and Dudley Moore
 in 'Raquel Welch'".

 I saw them once on stage in Boston.  There was a rotating set.  After
 a break, the stage was dark.  We heard a crash and then Peter Cook
 crying out "Help!" Ha-ha, we all laughed.  "Help!" And a ha-ha-ha from
 all of us.  "No really, Help!  I've fallen off the stage!" The thing
 had failed to rotate and he'd thought he was stepping off the back,
 but had actually stepped off into the orchestra pit.  The house
 lights went up and there was a delay before Peter Cook came back out,
 smoking a cigarette and looking strange.  And the show went on.

 I wish I had the patience to dig out and transcribe the PC&amp;DM routine
 about cancer.  Horribly funny.

 You might not have seen their post-atomic drama "The Bed-Sitting
 Room" about the last seven people alive in Britain after the bomb.

 The New Yorker said he wrote all their routines.  John Cleese said it
 took him three minutes to write a three-minute sketch.  Dudley Moore
 wanted to go beyond sketch comedy, which killed their act and left
 Peter Cook adrift, but no blame.

My life changed this morning.  I became a believer
in astrology, after all these years of contemptuous
skepticism.

I had the tv on while I was getting ready for work,
and the news channel mentioned the celebrity
birthdays for today (1/12):  Russ Limbaugh and
Howard Stern.  That is just too much of a coincidence
for me to handle.

Advice to anybody in the ninth month of pregnancy:
keep your legs crossed today.  Tie them together, if
necessary.  You don't want to mess with karma like
that, in your family.

Hey there. What are you up to now that you (like me) are no longer a Digit?

I've moved back to Australia after years and years away, and find
it quite nice. It has some of the nicer qualities I found (or wanted
to find) in the USA: a fairly relaxed attitude about most things;
great weather; an interesting and very diverse cultural mix; a TV
station like PBS wants to be; a radio station that plays good
(modern) music and is run by the Govt--hence no commercials--they
even play the full uncut version of "Short Dicked Man" by Miss. 20
Fingers--that's the Randy Newman "Short People" take-off. "Don't
want no short..." You get the idea. (Somehow I can't see that
getting any airplay in Newt-country). Perhaps "uncut" was a bad
choice of words....

On the down side, there are way too many creatures with more than 4 legs
here. It's a rare house that doesn't have cockroaches or spiders or something
else that will be dancing on humanity's grave when the bomb finally drops.
The ozone layer is mightly thin here too--skin cancer is so common you'd
think they were giving it away.

Still, a country that is about to get one of its legalized brothels listed
on the stock exchange, is laid back enough for me. I think I'll hang around
for a while  (or until the Democrats take back the Congress, which may mean
I'll retire here)

Subj:   Microsoft/Intel/Vatican/USDOJ collusion uncovered &amp; halted

                                =====

WASHINGTON D.C., January 17, 1995 (UPI) -- Investigative
reporters are hot on the trail of a scandal involving two
giants of American high technology, The Vatican(tm), and the
U.S. Department of Justice.  This reporter has learned that
Microsoft's recent acquisition of the U.S. Department of
Justice (a UPI scoop) was only the first step in what now
appears to be a planetary-scale plot to further inflate Bill
Gates' personal fortune via a Swiss bank account traced to
The Vatican(tm).  The scheme was ultimately foiled by the
unexpectedly widespread publication (via the Internet) of
the error modes of the Intel Pentium chip.

                  CONSPIRACY IN SILICON

The first tipoff that something was amiss was the discovery
that the U.S. DOJ had quashed the investigation of an
unusual accusation (by the banking industry, no less!) that
the Pentium's imperfections were DELIBERATE.  This reporter
has been in the business long enough (having done stakeout
time in a D.C. parking garage with Woodward &amp; Bernstein) to
know that when high-ups kill a probe of what seems like an
impossible plot, it's far more likely to be true.

A systems analyst at Chemical Bank noticed that typical
bit-patterns of the reported Pentium failures often matched,
to a full 8 bits past the decimal point, the emerging
standard for the headers of Encrypted Digital Microcash
Transaction of the Internet (EDMCTI).  Suspicious, the
analyst shared her discovery with her superiors.

Another source in the banking industry (known to this
reporter only as "Bob(tm)") says that internal investigators
are now shifting their attention to the very popular
"Quicken" electronic banking package, recently purchased
from Intuit by Microsoft.  If the Pentium failures are
deliberate, they reason, the chips may have been engineered
specifically to work with Microsoft financial applications.

These financial analysts also note that, perhaps coinci-
dentally, that the new, Microsoft-directed design team of
the next revision  of "Microsoft Quicken" are leading
designers and active proponents of EDMCTI.

                    THE SECRET SHARER

Careful electronic sleuthing of Pentium "failure modes"
published by many on the Internet and detailed in an "eyes
only" memo of the National Bankers' Association (dated
Friday, Jan. 13) reveals that some 59.4% of the "errors" are
such that fractional amounts of pennies would be rounded
DOWNWARDS to the lower amount whenever computations typical
of international currency transfers or multiple compound
interest rate reconciliations were executed.

The investigation turned serious when the remaining 40.6% of
the "failure" patterns were found to be an exact match to
the EDMCTI address of account #3.14149999999-W95-.9999999987
at the venerable Zurich (Switzerland) banking house of
Bruder Hassenpfeffer GmbH, which according to other sources
has been providing numbered bank accounts to The Vatican(tm)
for centuries.

A source within Hassenpfeffer (known only as "Roger"),
apparently disgruntled by the recent acquisition of the
Roman Catholic Church by William "Heavenly" Gates III
(another UPI scoop!), reported that this rather unusual
decimal account number (they usually use cardinals) was
instituted "...last summer at the request of a very nice
youngish honeymoon couple who told me they were driving
through the Alps for their honeymoon... in an open 1936
Mercedes Touring Car."  Roger further revealed that while
Bruder Hassenpfeffer GmbH were planning on supporting EDMCTI
on their Windows95 servers, its delivery had slipped.

The puzzle fell into place quickly.  It became clear that
the conspiracy encompassed the design of deliberate error
modes by Intel in their Pentium -- a microcomputer that is
of no use unless it is running a Microsoft operating system
(Operating Systems, like MS-DOS and Windows NT, are the
"nervous systems" of computers, enabling them to run useful
"applications" like Microsoft WORD -- and, more relevantly,
Microsoft QUICKEN.).

This reporter hypothesizes that Microsoft forced Intel into
building "defective-by-design" Pentiums -- or worse, bribed
them by offering them a share in the profits.  The profits
would have rolled in because of the expected huge popularity
of the Pentium, running the hugely popular QUICKEN personal
banking software, which would have used the EDMCTI standard
when ultimately run on the Internet.

                 HOW IT WOULD HAVE WORKED

Of all the millions of QUICKEN (plus other EDMCTI-compliant
banking applications') computations being run on Pentiums, a
very small proportion would trigger a designed-in round-down
of "just" a penny...  and ALL of those pennies would have
been securely encoded &amp; modem-transmitted, as if by an
occult hand, across cyberspace to Zurich, where (presumably)
"those newlyweds" would have split them with their co-
conspirators.

When contacted about the substance of this story, Microsoft,
Intel, the U.S. Department of Justice and The Vatican(tm)
had no comment.

                 THE CONSPIRACY UNRAVELS

Microsoft did, however, announce this morning, in an
"unrelated" development, that it has decided to divest
itself of both Intuit and Quicken, and that it also "has
full faith that the" (Microsoft-owned) "United States
Justice Department will find no reason to empanel a Grand
Jury to pursue this third-rate conspiracy theory."

At any rate, as soon as Intel was forced (by alert applied
mathematicians and the pressure of the marketplace) to
promise to produce and replace the defective chips with
"feature-free" non-EDMCTI-"compatible" Pentiums, the jig was
up.

Microsoft, it now seems likely, was behind the embarras-
singly overlong and ill-fated Intel rear-guard PR campaign
to justify their NOT replacing all the EDMCTI-tainted
Pentiums, but only to do so for customers who could PROVE
that they were doing higher mathematics.  This would have
retained the bulk of the population of "penny-siphon chips"
among the Rest Of Us using their Pentiums for Quicken.

The coverup began at that point, when it was clear that no
flood of encrypted pennies would be flowing to Zurich.

Only good fortune, the burgeoning power of the Information
Superhighway, and the nation's Free Press saved us from
sending yet more "billions to Bob(tm)."

Great to see Desperado riding again! But answer me this:
In the last couple of weeks, a man attacked another man
with a live armadillo (this happened in the town where I live,
and I expect a barrage of "Warning: Attack 'Dillo" signs to
spring up momentarily); a hapless would-be good samaritan
was beheaded by a runaway elevator ("For God's sake, take
the stairs!"); and researchers discovered a gene in crocodiles
that permits them to load up their blood with oxygen and thus
stay underwater for an hour or so at a time, prompting
exciting thoughts of genetically-engineering actual mer-people
[or croco-sapiens, perhaps]. But *all* of the networks have
been ignoring these exciting stories in favor of hourly updates
on the alleged trial of the alleged perpetrator of what is
really a rather typical example of Violence Among Persons
Known to One Another (i.e., most homicides in this country).
Why is this???

I suppose, what with no baby-down-a-well cases lately, the
Media Circus Department had to come up with something, but
this is just tooooo boring. If I had my own TV station (and
infinite funds), I'd counterprogram by re-staging the Lizzie
Borden trial in its entirety, and putting promo spots on all
the other networks... Or maybe it's just Big Brother's way
of telling me to quit watching so much television and go
clean the basement.

Don't let the armadillos bite,

 The secondmost amazing O.J. fact is the kiddie book he starred in a
 couple of years ago about the happy bunny in which O.J. saves the day
 by his ability to be in two places at once.

 The thirdmost amazing O.J. (or is it O.D.?) fact is the recent
 statement by one of his lawyers, "This bears all the earmarks of a
 drug-related slaying."

 Several folks politely pointed out that I could edit my mail header
 to fix the reply-to problem.  A couple of superfine individuals have
 provided material help on tracking down the lost tribe of Digits.
 And one hardy hearty has revealed that he had *already* started doing
 some HTML encoding of his file of old Desperadoes.  Gosh, with
 friends like these, I can retain my personal inadequacies without
 fear.
