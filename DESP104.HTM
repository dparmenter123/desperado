Lou Cohen, the quality guru, just got back from Japan.  Here are some
excerpts from his trip report.  I have removed a good bit of the
'quality guru' stuff (Welcome back, Lou) and retained the 'innocent abroad'
stuff.  I imagine Lou will send you the whole thing if you ask nicely.

Nihon means Nippon, which means Japan.

Subj: Trip Report: Japan, March 12 - March 23, 1984
        =============================================

I.  Main Conclusions

3.      NIHON-DEC Research and Development is an important
        but little known resource for DEC Central Engineering.

4.      NIHON-DEC is a very small factor in the Japanese
        computer marketplace.  The giants are Fujitsu, IBM,
        and NEC, followed by many other companies.  DEC is not
        even in the top 10.

II. Individual visits

A.      NIHON-DEC R&amp;D (JRD):

JRD is run by Tom Kobayashi.  He manages a small group of engineers
and they are struggling for identity.  They have been recruited
partly from other Japanese companies and partly right out of
University.

I believe that as the staff grows we will have within our midst a
cross-section of the most experienced and talented engineers Japan
has to offer.  Our obligation is to help them succeed so that DEC can
compete in the Japanese marketplace and so that we can learn how
Japanese engineering is done.

Incidentally, we already have one piece of information:  they want to
learn and begin using our existing procedures; they don't feel the
need to reinvent them.

The software group feels heavily dependent on technical and process
expertise from Central Engineering.  But because of cultural and
language differences they appear take what we say in the US on blind
faith, without making allowances for the swift changes in direction
and priority that occur here.

The engineers we met are committed to performing high quality
engineering and they are willing to work hard to get results.  They
are highly motivated to work within the system, and not to go around
it.  Since they are an engineering function and they are part of
Digital, they assume that Central Engineering in the U.S. would want
to support their efforts.

One major project was:

Japanese Language Processing System (software).  This system is
needed in order for NIHON-DEC to be competitive in Japan.  In the
past any Japanese engineer who used a computer was able to read
enough English to use one of our systems unmodified.  But as
computers become more widespread in Japan, they push against the
language barrier.  Clerks and secretaries usually have no English
language abilities at all; they cannot even read our alphabet.
Because of the complexities of written Japanese, and because of the
differences between written Japanese and any western language, the
new features needed in our software and hardware extend deeply into
the guts of our systems.

Nevertheless, we have identified several areas of the JLPS project
which are of value to all of Digital engineering.  They are:

-       Implementation of 2-byte code capabilities under VMS.

-       High speed (40 pages per minute and higher) laser printer
        support.

-       General purpose image processing (input, internal
        manipulation, and soft- and hard- copy output).

-       Advanced forms management.

-       Generic file format (for representing mixed data types
        including images).

Site visit: Nippon Electric Company (NEC).

This visit was possible because of DEC's status as a valued customer
of NEC.  During a sales visit from NEC to Maynard last year, I met
and became friendly with Dr. Masaru Nakagiri, the Reliability Manager
of NEC's 1st LSI Division in Kawasaki City (near Tokyo).  At our
first meeting in the U.S.  we discussed many aspects of quality
control, and we agreed to meet again upon my visit to Japan.

In the design area, they appear to use techniques very similar to
ours - they simulate what they can and then they rely on breadboards
for debugging.  They have an innate instinct for teamwork, and at the
moment that may be their only advantage.

I introduced formal inspections to NEC and they appeared to be very
interested.  By dinner that night, they were able to enumerate
several advantages of inspections for them.

I was very interested in the reliance NEC has on its QC Circles for
quality on the production line.  They seem to have no other strategy
except to rely on their workers and on the QC Circle methods to find
and solve production line problems.  NEC management encourages QC
Circles by publicizing the active groups and by inventing various
"status incentives" (rather than "money incentives") to encourage the
QC Circles to be active.

We tried to discover whether QC Circles were rewarded for results
(the "bottom line" approach) or for good methodology and diligence.
The answer, as best we could determine, was that both results and the
use of good process were rewarded.  A group that did all the right
things but had no results to show for it seemed to get rewarded as
much as a group that misused or ignored the QC Circle processes, but
still managed to achieve some quality improvements.  But such
"extreme" groups are hypothetical examples, and actually may not
exist.  It would probably take several hours of careful discussion to
get a complete answer on this topic.

As far as I could tell, there was very little in the way of
individual reward on the production line; only group reward.  Things
appear to be quite different at the professional level, but we were
not able to find out about that aspect of company policy.

Engineers at NEC were extremely interested in DEC's policy of giving
our engineers terminals in their offices and especially at home.  I don't
think NEC engineers have given much thought to people working at home.
This could be in part because most professional people in Japan are
paid extra for working extra hours, whereas DEC engineers are not.
Another concept that fascinated them was our general policy of "flex-time".
Unfortunately, language barriers and lack of time made it difficult for
us to fully understand what they meant by flex-time, and for us to fully
explain what we meant by it.

Another insight for me was the disclosure by NEC (and also by others
at some of other visits) that much of the early pressure within a
company for increased quality and productivity came from the rank and
file workers and middle management, and then spread, finally reaching
top management late in the game.  At JUSE, the quality movement in
Japan was described as a "bottoms up" movement.   This does not mean that
top management gave only lip-service to quality, as many of us believe of
American top management.  I think it means that top management did not
in the beginning understand what their role should be, and therefore had
to be taught by their subordinates.  With knowledge came the ability to
convert their commitment into action.

III. Japanese culture

A.      The people

We found the Japanese people friendly and eager to help us when we had
difficulties.  In Tokyo many people can speak a little English.  This is less
true in the south of Japan, however.

The people are very law-abiding (as far as we could understand the law); for
instance, there is almost no jay-walking in Japan, and furthermore, auto
drivers always give pedestrians the right of way, including space to cross at
crosswalks.  I found this to be very pleasant.  Drivers seem very polite.
Even when they are aggressive, they still seem to drive safely.  We saw very
little evidence of fender-benders. Most cars on the street in Tokyo were very
new and very quiet.  Rarely are horns honked.

The balance of power between men and women is very different from that in the
U.S.  Women as a rule are expected to work only until they marry, and the
normal age for marriage seems no later than about 23 or 24 for women.  The age
of the female workforce is from 19 to about 24.  Women of this age work as
secretaries, clerks, waitresses, production line workers, and other
non-professional jobs.  It seemed as if most QC Circles consist of women, but
this information is based on very scanty data. Men in industry, on the other
hand, work until retirement, which in many companies is age 60.

Regarding the legendary tirelessness of the work force, we had been told that
at NEC engineers were routinely in the office until 8PM on weekday nights, and
occasionally on Saturdays.  NEC marketing men are supposed to put in even
longer hours, often staying in the office until 10PM, and sometimes as late as
2AM.  This information was given to us in the U.S. by an American NEC salesman
and we did not confirm it on our trip.

We did see that many men leave work at the end of office hours (5:30 or 6:00
PM), and go out together for dinner and several glasses of beer or sake.
There may be some commercial sexual activity associated with this
"bar-hopping", and we were given to believe by some Japanese men that Japanese
wives understand and permit, or at least don't complain about such conduct.
At about 9PM, the subways are filled with drunken men on thier way home.
(Some of our party were accompanied by spouses, so our Japanese host had some
difficulty figuring out how to entertain us in the evening).

There are a small but apparently growing number of women who aspire to
professional carreers, and they are continually faced with many of the same
difficulties American women commonly had 20 years ago: tea- and coffee-
serving and other non-professional tasks become thier jobs in the office.
Many of these women are no doubt attracted to "maverick" companies such as
NIHON-DEC, because the western influence makes thier objectives a little
easier to achieve.

B.      The language

a.      Getting around

In Tokyo, it is not too hard to get around on your own.  Subway maps and some
subway signs are printed in Romaji (romanized Japanese) and most hotels and
DEC locations are close to subway stops.

The famous Japanese train system is also fairly easy to use, at least in the
part of Japan we visited. Some signs were in English, even some public
announcements were in English, and people everywhere are helpful.

Taxis are a little harder to use because most cab drivers don't speak much
English.  In addition, many streets in Tokyo (and all over Japan, for that
matter) have no names.  To make matters worse, buildings within each city
district are numbered according to the order in which they were built, not
according the order that they appear on any street. Therefore it is often
necessary to discuss directions with the taxi driver as you approach your
destination.  Having knowledge of some conversational Japanese can be quite
handy.

A fairly good, but not perfect, approach we used was to get a knowledgeable
Japanese person to write down the name of the destination along with some
description of what landmarks it is near, in Japanese.  Even with this
preparation we had difficulty on one occasion.

b.      Negotiating business.

A person who knows of few words of a foreign language can often create the
mistaken impression that he knows much more.  In Japan, many professional
people know some English, but when a conversation gets around to expressing
complex ideas, the language barrier can be colossal.

We had many business discussions with Japanese managers where we spent 30
minutes or more just trying to understand simple things like what the agenda
for the meeting would be, whether programmers develop code interactively, or
whether a certain company always used all parts of their formal engineering
process or not.  At times we simply had to give up on a question because we
could find no way to ask it for which the answer was clear.

For English written by a Japanese, there are additional chances for
misunderstanding.  Here is a quote from "QC Circle Koryo", the QC Circle
"bible" published in Japanese and English by the Japanese Union of Scientists
and Engineers:

                "This publication is basically a direct translation
                of the Japanese text.  Difference in backgrounds may
                make it difficult for non-Japanese readers to
                understand the text.  We expect international readers
                will modify what is written to adapt it to individual
                background, or try to understand the intent of the
                book by studying the social background of Japan."

I read this passage back to JUSE and asked them if we could have permission to
rewrite the book for our Digital audience, and of course I expected that the
answer would be yes.  I was wrong.  They explained that when a Japanese person
offers his work to another, it is customary to apologize for its weaknesses,
because it is impolite to show pride in one's own work.  The quoted paragraph
was simply that sort of an apology.  They explained that they regard their
book as a "bible"; they want to keep QC Circles standardized, and they do not
wish to have anyone actually change the book.

C.      The customer comes first.

With a few exceptions, in every place of business in Japan we were confronted
by evidence that the customer comes first.  Whenever we entered a business
establishment our arrival was greeted by cries of: "Irassyaimase!"
("Welcome!") from everyone present, often even employees standing in the far
corners of the room.

When we purchased merchandise in a department store, the clerk (a young woman,
of course) routinely inspected each item before wrapping it.  Then each item
was wrapped with great care in what would be considered gift wrapping in the
United States.  Even inexpensive key-chains costing about $1 each were
individually wrapped and placed in individual bags.  On occasions when a
Japanese clerk was unable to serve us to our satisfaction, she was clearly
disturbed and embarrassed. A waitress placed a plate of food on our table and
as she did so a small piece of food fell off the plate onto the table. Her
embarrassment knew no bounds.

We rarely had to wait to be taken care of.  If we did have to wait, we were
made as comfortable as possible.  When business was completed, everyone
routinely called out, many times:  "Arigatoo gozaimasu!" ("Thank you!").

All of this unaccustomed attention eventually had a subtle effect on us. We
grew to expect this treatment everywhere we went.  Not until we arrived in San
Francisco on the way home did we realize how spoiled we had become.  At the
airport we went to a restaurant for brunch.  A long line of people waited
outside the door.  No one seemed to be in attendance.  Many tables inside
appeared to be empty; some were cleared, many others were loaded with dirty
dishes and no one was clearing them.  When a hostess appeared, there were no
welcomes, no apologies (she laughed, actually).  Gradually, the people on line
were seated.  Service was very slow.  A few errors were made in the orders.
One of our party tried to change a $10 bill at the cash register but was
rejected (we retaliated by paying our check with a $50 bill!).  It was very
clear that whoever came first in that restaurant, it was NOT the customer.

Granted, this comparison may seem exaggerated, and could be biased because as
westerners in Japan we may have received special treatment.  But even after
discounting much of this impression, if even a small part of this attention to
customers is multiplied by a whole nation of shopkeepers, we are a looking at
a cultural phenomenon.  When we ask ourselves at DEC, "What is our unfair
competitive advantage?"  perhaps we should also ask, "What is our
competition's unfair competitive advantage, and how are we going to cope with
it?". Certainly one advantage the Japanese have over us is a concern for
customers and an ability to make customers feel important.

V. Conclusion.

Japan is a very dynamic and exciting country, filled with old temples and the
most modern computers.  A short two week visit only allowed us to scratch the
surface of what's happening in Japan.  Language and cultural differences slow
communication down, but even a small understanding of Japanese can help
matters.

I am planning to be in Japan for a few months this Fall, and I hope that the
extra time will allow me to report more fully on what they are doing that
we ought to know about.

Over the Easter holiday, in a desperate attempt to escape the tongue

the electronics section, I espied the very first computer I had ever
fixed as a spotty-faced field service engineer resplendent in its
corner under the sign "AN EARLY DATA PROCESSOR".

It had had a fresh coat of paint on its Queen Anne style legs and the
valves (tubes to our colonial friends) still glowed nicely keeping
the room warm. What brought its age home though was the 8088 on a
stand in front with the sign "THIS SINGLE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT NOW

still trying to figure out if the 8088 can really read 40 column

I, too, had a Digicomp I when a tyke.  It has long since disintegrated as

I wonder if the theory that even-numbered versions are superior held
back in those days?  The idea is that Version 1 is always rushed and
Version 2 has everything left out of Version 1, while Version 3
attempts new stuff and Version 4 fixes it.  Of course, with our
complex numbering schemes, it is alternate versions instead of
even-numbered . . .

Subject: Desperado item

From the list we use to order IEG items:

        PART #          DESCRIPTION                     MLP$    XFER COST
        H9642-DH        UNANNOUNCED PRODUCT            5500.00    1725.00

I wonder what it is.   Whatever it is, it comes in a cabinet, and has
a customer price.

Sounds like a grabbag.   We've put something nobody wants into a cabinet
(probably with the right power supply) and allow customers to order it. If Joe
Customer has $5500 + sales tax and shipping he doesn't know what to do with,
we'll take his money and give him something.   WARNING:   That something might
not do what you want it to (if not, see figure 1;  you bought it knowing that.
On the other hand, it might be a real winner, like a used PDP-15.)

Maybe we should have periodic "Two for one" sales...

I wonder if Field Service will cover it on a contract?

So it goes.  I'm backed up, as you might guess, so I'll be having
another baby this week sometime.
