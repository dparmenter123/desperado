Subject: A real Desperado

Our young network hacker, Kevin Mitnick, is in trouble again.

(Mitnick, who lives in sunny Southern California, began breaking
into our RSTS systems at age 15.  Recent Desperado reports on
Mitnick told of his exploits while at DECUS and how he was watched
every minute he was in the exhibit hall.)

About two weeks after DECUS he was caught in a lab at USC with a
listing of a user account file in his hands.

He has been on probation for a "phone company violation."  This is
somewhat more serious, since the ARPA net and Defense Department
contracts are involved.  At a minimum, he will lose his probation
and be sent back to the youth center to finish the last two years
of his three-year sentence.

But he's no longer a juvenile, and the evidence they have is strong
enough for a felony burglary charge.

The California/Federal criminal justice systems will have to decide
whether he is a hopeless case or whether he should have substitute
parents (i.e. youth center) to continue his growing up.

Hmm. Evidence seems to be piling up to suggest that the American metabolic
system is becoming drastically different from its English counterpart...
caffeine is apparently a drug that has a major effect on the central
nervous system even in dosages found in Cola drinks. What can this all
mean?

Disregard this, I'm tripping on Pepsi.

        Attention all Desperados. I have always said you could hold
Hewlett-Packard's greatest achievements in the palm of your hand. In
keeping with this, I have found that the HP-16C is possibly Homo-
computerus's (sorry about that Latin fans) best friend. It is a true
Godsend to those of us with 10 fingers instead of 8 as it converts hex
to decimal to octal to binary and any combination of above. Its also
programmable. I am keeping a library of useful routines and would also
like to generate a mailing list of interested parties. Please send those
cards and letters to TSC::PSEUDO::FELDMAN.

Subject: Wanted: test sites

In the interest of "developing better software for a better tommorow", I need
a couple of test sites for some dyed-in-the-wool computer game hackers.

What I've got is a version of the venerable MULTI-TREK which myself and
another hacker have been working on since July, called MULTI-TREK-PLUS.  It's
the basic MTREK game, with the following improvements:

tractor beams           friendly/enemy bases            freighters
ship homing             better firing algorithms        damage control
multiple universes      up to 250x250 universe size     improved cloaking

The game runs best on an M+ system with lots of memory, but it should run
on smaller M systems as well.  So far, it's been tested on M V4/V4.1, and
M+ V1/V2/V2.1.  If anybody's interested, send me mail, or use PHONE to
try to get me here.

PS--Due to restraints on memory management in AME under VMS, the game won't
run on a VAX.

   Subject: Notes on George Michaels's Talk on Supercomputers

   I attended the talk by George Michael at MR1, 5 January  1982.  George
   is  director  of  advanced  computer  research  at  Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory. He was invited  here  as  part  of  the  Computer
   Museum's Supercomputer lecture series.

   George seems to be on a lecture circuit of industry and academe,  with
   the  goal  of  enlisting all possible help to achieve breakthroughs in
   computing  power.  I  was  somewhat  surprised  to  see  a  large  and
   enthusiastic  DEC audience. It seems that there is a subculture of DEC
   supercomputer boosters. You'd hardly guess it from the  speed  of  the
   processors we make to sell.

   To set the stage: George is a big man, about 50; he looks rather  like
   Jackie  Gleason.  He  talks  nonstop  with  great energy and high good
   humor. One gets the impression that he has little  use  for  managers,
   organization  charts,  computer operators, or anyone who can't keep up
   with the his thinking.

   George's job, and quite a job it is,  is  to  discover  how  LLNL  can
   acquire  by  1990  computers 100 times as fast as the Cray-1. In units
   familiar to us at Digatal, that's 30,000  times  as  fast  as  a  VAX-
   11/780.

   He reviewed the current state of LLNL's computing resources; the  only
   possible  word  is "awesome." I worked there in the early 1970's, when
   the Octopus network (it was really shaped  more  like  an  octopus  in
   those  days)  comprised 4 CDC-7600's and 3 -6600's (about 140 times an
   11/780 overall). Doesn't sound  like  so  much  today  (the  E-net  is
   larger),  but  at  the  time it was surely awesome. As indeed the LLNL
   computer center has been since 1952. Now they have 4  Cray-1's  and  3
   -7600's (total of 1400 times an 11/780), and other goodies such as:

      -  a 2-terabit automated tape library

      -  a 1/2-terabit tape-cartridge storage system that is  only  a
         little slower than a disk

      -  4 FR-80 microfiche recorders (10 million pages/month)

      -  a  rather   high-speed   non-impact   printing   system   (6
         pages/second; one million pages/month)

   Today the network serves 2500 users. It all connects together  over  a
   bus running at 40 Mbits/sec.

   George showed a graph of computer power (at LLNL) vs. time since 1950.
   In each of the two decades 1950-1960 and 1960-1970, they acheived 100-
   fold increases. In the most recent decade the curve flattened out, and
   the  increase  was  more  like  30-fold. LLNL wants to get back on the
   100X-per-decade curve, and soon.

   Most of the increases in the first two decades came from  improvements
   in component speed. While there is more potential to be exploited here
   (Ga-As and J-J technology for  instance),  George  believes  that  the
   returns  are  beginning to diminish from component improvements alone.
   Most of the increase in the 1970-1980 came from architectural advances
   --  specifically  from  pipelining  and  vectorization. These advances
   weren't fully exploited, because people spent the decade learning  how
   to write software to take advantage of them.

   George expects the next decade's computer-power improvements  to  come
   mainly  from architectural and software advances. And LLNL is spending
   considerable effort to enlist industry and academe to help. They  have
   provided  much of the funding for the development of the VAL data-flow
   compiler, for example. And they are  encouraging  industry  people  to
   spend  1-year sabbaticals at LLNL in order to get a better idea of the
   problems that need solving.

   Here are some other ramdom tidbits from George Michaels' talk.

      -  LLNL will put two Cray XMP machines in service  early  in  1984.
         These souped-up Cray-1's do perhaps 25 Mflops (vs. 10 Mflops for
         Cray-1). The Cray-2 (1984 or 1985) should be an 80- or 100-Mflop
         machine.

      -  An apocryphal story of the final days  of  Johnny  von  Neumann:
         from  his  deathbed  (mid-1950's?) von Neumann telephoned Edward
         Teller, AEC commisioner Strauss, and others, with this  message:
         "Livermore   must   continue   to   stretch  the  boundaries  of
         computation. You must promise me that they will  have  unlimited
         resources to do so."

      -  In response to a question, George said that  he  is  betting  on
         data-flow  languages  to produce the biggest gains in the coming
         decade.

      -  LLNL sent some people to Japan to look  at  their  supercomputer
         effort.  This  is  completely  separate from the "5th-generation
         computer" work (which the Japanase are  now  calling  the  "new-
         generation  computer"  -- I hadn't heard that before). Six large
         companies are being funded by MITI at $100M per  year  total  to
         deliver  1  or  2  machines  by  1989.  The target is 1000-Mflop
         machines -- the same goal George cites for LLNL. He  thinks  the
         Japanese  won't make it, but will significantly advance a number
         of technologies by having tried.

      -  The LLNL inhouse supercomputer-design effort called S1 --  which
         I  read about 2 years ago and haven't heard of since -- is alive
         and well. Their goal is something like 1  or  2  Cray-2's  on  a
         board  by 1985 (S1 Mark-5). George is not optimistic about their
         chances. (Cray-2 cycle time will be 4 ns [!], vs. 50 ns  for  S1
         Mark-5.  It's  hard to see how S1 can make up for that factor of
         12-1/2.) But he praises one of the side-effects of the work, the
         CAD system called SCALD, which is in use now in various places.

      -  George thinks the Russians have several Cray-1 machines, "But  I
         think  we  have  more.  But  the density of first-rate people is
         higher around their machines. Our brightest people are going off
         to  start  companies  and  make  a  pot of money." He doubts the
         Russians could build one of their own.

      -  Quote George Michael: "Seymour Cray is  solely  responsible  for
         all  'weapons-grade'  computers designed since 1962. If the Rus-
         sians were smart..."
