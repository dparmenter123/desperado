||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, that party we had was one winner attended by many a Desperado,
RSXer, friend, and stranger.  Even NEMO::NEMO was there to take the
award for anonymity.  It seems RANI::LEICHTERJ may have won the
distance award, having come from New Haven - not just to party - but
party he did.  He even got to debate file-format religion with Bill
Todd, with whom he had been flaming in the RSX FLAMES Notes file on
ALIEN.  Other folks I had met only over the net included
BERGIL::PHALEN, Mike Vosbury, who claimed to be the only hardware folk
in the room, HYDRA::NEUBLING the Tesla freak, and many a Spit Brook
Desperado, not to overlook all the people I am overlooking.

The band, Coupe de Ville, was real high tech, consisting of two Decis,
three Hewlett Packards, and a single Wang.  For all that tech talent,
however,  Coup de Ville had a real down-home sound, playing mostly
50s rhythm and blues and 60s soul that really did this Georgia
cracker's heart good. Pink and black is coming back!

And, in response to thousands of requests (from me) I even sang a
couple of numbers in my heartfelt rasp.  Flaming Jim Salman, the
rock'n'roll fish, and the very first NEMO contributor in Desperado
history, also blazed away on guitar.

Mucho Desperado gracias to Charla Mustard-Foote and all who organized
and brought food and so forth, and to Billy the Bartender.

                  PERSON CLOBBERED BY MANHOLE COVER

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
One (me) is inevitably reminded of the definition: 'Person: a woman
doing a man's job.'  At any rate, there seems to be some dispute here
as to whether the triangular personhole covers of Nashua will fall
through on your head or not.

From: DOSADI::BINDER       "Wanted:  A good five-cent nickel"
To:   TOM

Yes, Nashua does indeed have triangular manhole covers.  They are equilateral.
I don't know why they're triangular, but a possible reason is so that they
can be taken down through the manholes to leave the surrounding street clear.
One hopes that some indication would be left that any manhole so denuded is
uncovered...

Subject: personhole covers

I don't know why Nashua uses triangular (yes, equilateral) manhole covers.
Most places use round covers.  The round covers fit into holes which have a
small lip on which the cover sits.  The cover can never fall into the
hole because the diameter of the cover is always greater than the inner
diameter of the lip of the hole.  The same holds true for triangular
holes and covers.  That is why Nashua can get away with triangles.

A square cover wouldn't work.  It could be turned diagonally and dropped
into the hole since the diagonal measurement of a square is greater than
the length of the side.  What other shapes can be used for manhole covers
(which can't be dropped in)?  What is the general rule here?

Subject: Caution: Falling Utility Hole Covers...

As it turns out, triangular "personhole" (whatever) covers can be
accidently dropped into the hole.

As I see it, given an equilateral triangle of side dimension "L", the
shortest edge-to-edge dimension is the distance from any of the vertices
to the middle of the opposite side, which (if I remember my high school
geometry) is root 3 over 2 times L.

If the cover is aligned to be perpendicular to the ground, so that the
shortest dimension (the line from the vertex to the middle of the
opposite side) is parallel to the ground, the cover will fall in neatly,
beaning the occupant, with  "L-((root 3 over 2)*L)" to spare (assuming
an infinitesimal lip on the hole).

I will admit that you would have to work to create this situation, but
it can be done.

One can only speculate about the reason.  Possibly Nashua is a slave to
fashon and triangles were "in" that year...

Umm Tom, unless the Nashuans have invented a new kind of triangle,
it is quite possible for the cover to fall through the hole.
In fact, a circular cover is the only shape that will work.

Years ago a published riddle had it that all personhole covers (I yearn to say
'manhole', but it sounds not just obscene but perverted) had to be round
because any other shape could be turned around into a position allowing it to
[Bfall through the hole it used to cover and clobber the poor person.  I think
it was Tom Hayden who pointed out that triangular covers couldn't either; but
I was inclined to exculpate the poor riddler on the grounds that triangles
were such awkward cover shapes he would naturally overlook to consider them.
Everyone seemed to agree that triangles were a ridiculous shape (just BECAUSE
of shoulders, in fact: if your shoulders don't fit through a circle you can
imagine what to do about it, but try to imagine hunching them through a
triangle).  That, of course, was before all those folks moved from ML to ZK!

                REAL PROGRAMMERS DON'T DO MICROCODE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
More, perhaps definitive, on the question of whether microcoding has
anything to do with programming.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: DOSADI::ARNOLD       "from the World of Micro-scum..."
To:   KERMIT::PARMENTER

We were lucky to have our stuff called "firmware"; Brian Allison, our
engineering manager, wanted to call microcode written in Pascal (for the
Aurora IO board) "Mushware."   It is acceptable to be called a "firmware
programmer," or a "microcoder," but a "mushware programmer"???

Actually, I think the root of the notion that microcoding is not programming
is  partly  traditional,  and  partly  the  result  of  the division between
hardware  and  software.

In  my  experience,  it  it  relatively  rare for someone to understand both
hardware  and  software in reasonable detail. (This trend may be changing as
time goes on, and computers become less strange to the general public.) Yet,
this is exactly what is needed to be a good microcoder. The understanding of
the  hardware  must  be  there because the microcode is making the low level
hardware GO, (that is, emulate whatever function it is supposed to perform,)
or  is at least very involved with the raw hardware (as in an I/O microcode,
a  la  CI780,  or  the  UDA50.)

On the other hand, reading is easier than writing; the microcoder's hardware
skills  need  not  necessarily  be so sharp as to be able to design a module
from  scratch. The software skills, however, must be quite sharp, especially
as  modern  microcodes  tend  to  be  enormous  programs. One of DG's Nova's
microcode had about 390 words (see Soul of a New Machine.) That was released
in  the  mid  seventies.  The  KL10  had 1350 words. The UDA50 has over 4000
words.  The  disk server firmware I am currently writing will have over 6000
lines of ELN (pronounced 'Elan') Pascal code. And the code in these programs
is  usually  'difficult'  in that it is either concerned with abstuse things
like  how  floating  point  division REALLY works, or with intense real-time
situations, like controlling a disk, or the Ethernet.

It  is  a  common  notion in computer circles that hardware and software are
really  different  ways  of  viewing  the same thing, and that often one can
trade  one  for  the  other.  However, the manner of thinking used to design
hardware is different from that used to design software, I believe.

Software  is  sequential,  and  deals  with relatively high level functions,
especially  if  you  are  building a user application. Calculations occur in
sequence,  and are atomic. Time is the number of PC's that have gone by. The
software  world  is  'perfect'  in  that most of the time the programmer can
assume that hardware never makes errors.

For  hardware,  events  occur in parallel, and must be explicitly prohibited
whevever  a sequentiality must be imposed (as in having a disable, or a chip
select.)  The  level  of  the  operations  is  lower,  as in AND/NAND gates,
registers,  busses,  drivers,  flops, multipliers, etc. Time is a real thing
that must be considered, as in propagation delays, and setup times; there is
more awareness that the behavior of the hardware is an *APPROXIMATION* of an
ideal.

It  is  this  difference  in  view  that  makes  microcoders  unusual: to be
successful, you must combine two different viewpoints in one person; and you
must  be  relatively  good  at  both.  Just being able to see that different
points  of  view  are  valid  is  unusual  in our society; perhaps this also
re-enforces the notion that microcoder's are 'misfits.'

I  say the view is traditional because before microcode was invented (by our
own  Maurice  Wilkes) there obviously were no microcoders. As the need arose
to  get  greater  function  without vastly increased hardware, microcode was
used  more  and  more. At first the microcodes were very small (often just a
few  words),  and  there  was  no  need to have a special person for it; the
engineer  of  the hardware would just write it, and not be concerned that it
might  be  considered  a  program.  But  as  the  microcodes got larger, the
programming  aspect  got  LOTS harder, and engineers had to have someone who
knew  about  software to work on it. Hardware types and software types often
thought  each  other were pretty queer ducks to begin with, and now they had
to work together! No wonder that someone who could do it would be considered
queer  ducks by both sides. Being considered such by everyone is the classic
definition of a 'misfit.'

To:   KERMIT::PARMENTER
Subject: Herewith my definitions of "software" and "microcode"

The terms "software", "firmware", and "microcode" have seen a lot of use
and abuse over the years, to the point where nobody really knows what they
mean anymore (except me, of course).  So, I will define them:

Microcode:  This is the stuff that lives in the ROMS on one of the boards
on your 11/780 (pieces get loaded in off the floppy when the 780 boots,
too).  Each microword of this stuff is 96 bits long, and the 780 has 4K
microwords on one of its boards.  Every VAX processor has a different size
of microword, and a different number of microwords.  They also have
different ways of storing it (the 780 used a PROM with a way to patch it,
the 750 used a ROM with no way to patch it, and the 730/725 used TU58s).

The microcode is what actually makes the machine execute the MOVL, AOBLSS,
MOVC5, and other instructions that make up a VAX program.

Notice that microcode that is written for a 780 will NOT execute on a 750
or 730 or anything else, for that matter.  It is very machine specific.  It
is also very weird.

(The word "microcode" was coined by Maurice Wilkes, I believe; he is the
guy who invented the concept many years ago.)

Software:  Software is the stuff you write when you use instructions like
MOVL, AOBLSS, MOVC5, etc.  (And, by implication, when you write in PASCAL,
FORTRAN, C, etc., since those languages get translated into MOVLs and
AOBLSSs.)  Software lives in either RAM or ROM.  If it lives in RAM, it has
to get loaded before it will execute.

Software is the VAX program that the microcode executes.

Software is generally not machine specific (or, at least, that's the goal).
Software written for a VAX will execute on all VAX processors, albeit with
some restrictions.

Firmware:  Firmware is software that lives in a ROM; mostly in dedicated
applications.  The code that is in the famous "microprocessor controlled
toaster" (made by the Minuteman Toaster Company, of course) is firmware.

There is a wide misconception that any code written for a microprocessor is
microcode.  This is false.  What is written for microprocessors is
software.

Microcode is written to make CPU hardware emulate the macro instruction
set, or to make a given piece of hardware do its thing.  The 11/780 Unibus
adapter contains microcode.  The DEUNA, however, since it has a T-11 on it,
contains firmware.

Microcode is written by hardware folks because an intimite knowledge of the
hardware is required to write it.  And I don't mean an intimite knowledge
of the FUNCTION of the hardware, either; you have to understand what all
the gates and latches and whatnot do.

Hope this clears things up.

                                =*=

        NOW THAT WE'VE GOT ALL THAT MICROCODE, WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT?

but he's pretty upset with DEC right now.

The level of carelessness that could allow such an error to occur
almost defies my imagination.  A certified idiot who at least halfway
cared about what he was doing could see that a graphics option order
and a floor stand box don't belong together.  There must be some
mickeymouse modularized "system" in which the order processer never
sees the shipment and the shipper never reads the packing slip.  If
you open up the cracks wide enough, something as big as that can slip
through.

The fact that my brother-in-law can't get this situation fixed is less
surprising but it still bothers me.
