    Maybe you haven't heard enough about Salman Rushdie yet.

    The ayatollah thinks that Iran "is under a powerful external threat"
    and that "at this moment, with all these maneuvers there is clearly the
    need to maintain a high level of control".  Since Rushdie's book is "a
    bit of a rag", is "CIA-inspired" and does not have "a profound respect
    for the truth", who cares that Iran is out to get him?

    Funnily enough, that's not the ayatollah talking at all.  The quotes
    all come from Rushdie a couple of years ago, and what he was trying to
    do was justify the Sandinista's shutdown of La Prensa, the last
    newspaper in Nicaragua not controlled by the government.  To be fair,
    Rushdie did say, in his book "The Jaguar Smile", that it was wrong to
    shut the paper down, but he said all the other stuff too.

    Rushdie, now under the full-time personal protection and approbation of
    the Western democracies, said in 1986:  "It seems to me that in Western
    countries now, democracy operates more or less entirely outside the
    state, in various groupings of ideas such as anti-nuclear protest or
    feminism or anti-racism."

    So, when the ayatollah puts a price on your head, who you gonna call?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
That doesn't mean I don't think the attack on Rushdie is barbaric.

In further clarification, I didn't read "The Jaguar's Smile".  I got all
this stuff from the Wall Street Journal.

I'm filled with trepidation about this item. I certainly don't want it
misinterpreted, but there it is.  Don't murder authors.  Don't shut
down newspapers.  Be very careful when you mess with freedom of speech.

&gt;From Ted Holden, HTE:

&gt;From Karla Jennings:

&gt;I am looking
&gt;for stories. Heard any tales second- or third-hand that sound possibly true but
&gt;that "happened to a friend of a friend" in different places at different times?
&gt;I'm also interested in stories that might have started in actual fact but that
&gt;have become so popular that they keep popping up.

OK, you asked for it.  Did you ever wonder about the uses to which modern
computer science and database technology might get put to out there in the
third world?...  a buddy of mine swears this one is true:

He claims to have been working as a contractor in Indonesia in the
seventies when, having gotten rid of Suharto and the indigenous
communists, the government of the islands decided to take the last major
step and pull the nation into the 20'th century alltogether:  they
outlawed head-hunting.  The next day, on a number of the islands, the
people were walking around in utter dejection and dismay thinking "Oh my
God, this is the end of civilization as we know it, now nobody can ever
get married or have children any more and we're just all gonna f___ing
die!!!!".  Turned out that before a young man could get married or start a
family, he had to go through initiation, which involved cutting off at
least one human head and shrinking it according to tradition.

The economies of the islands involved ground to a crunching halt;  the
legislature was forced to meet again and reconsider whether they'd gone
too far in too short a period of time.  The compromise solution which
they worked out went roughly as follows:  no NEW human heads were to be
cut or shrunk, but census-takers took a total survey of all EXISTING
shrunken heads, tatooing numbers on them and registering them according
to owner, and compiling all of this valuable information into a computer
database.  Thereafter, when a young man was to undergo initiation, the
government supplied him with printouts showing the whereabouts of all
the shrunken heads in his region, and he STOLE one of them, at which
point, the database was updated with him as owner of that head.

My buddy claims to have designed that database.

Subj:   MIT's library

Hi Tom,

Strictly speaking, the MIT libraries are open to anyone who
wants to walk in.  However, the last time I was there, they
wouldn't let me take any books *out* unless I had one of their
cards.  (Unlike the U.Va. library, which issues a card free to any
Charlottesville resident who applies, MIT expects non-students
to *pay* for a library card.)  It's been two years since I visited there,
so I can't quote current rates...  Probably belaboring the
the analogy anyhow.

FWIW,

Subj:   There's a limit to the authority and privileges of rank

     From a recent Forbes magazine:

        THERE'S A LIMIT TO THE AUTHORITY AND PRIVILEGES OF RANK

     This was never made more clear than in this tale by Frank Koch in
_Proceedings_, the Naval Institute's magazine:

     "Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on
maneuvers in heavy weather for several days.  I was serving on the lead
battleship and was on watch on the bridge as night fell.  The visibility
was poor with patchy fog, so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an
eye on all activities.

     "Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported,
'Light, bearing on the starboard bow.'

     "'Is it steady or moving astern?' the captain called out.

     "Lookout replied, 'Steady, captain,' which meant we were on a
dangerous collision course with that ship.

     "The captain then called to the signalman, 'Signal that ship:  We are
on a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees.'

     "Back came a signal, 'Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.'

     "In reply, the captain said, 'Send:  I'm a captain, change course 20
degrees!'

     "'I'm a seaman second class,' came the reply, 'You had better change
course 20 degrees.'

     "By that time, the captain was furious.  He spit out, 'Send:  I'm a
battleship, change course 20 degrees.'

     "Back came the flashing light, 'I'm a lighthouse!'

     "We changed course."

Warning: There's a new virus on the loose that's worse than anything
I've seen before!  It gets in through the power line, riding on the
powerline 60 Hz subcarrier.  It works by changing the serial port
pinouts, and by reversing the direction one's disks spin.  Over
300,000 systems have been hit by it here in Murphy, West Dakota alone!
And that's just in the last twelve minutes.

It attacks DOS, Unix, TOPS-20, Apple II, VMS, MVS, Multics, Mac,
RSX-11, ITS, TRS-80, and VHS systems.

To prevent the spread of this dastardly worm:

1) Don't use the powerline.
2) Don't use batteries either, since there are rumors that this virus
   has invaded most major battery plants and is infecting the positive
   poles of the batteries.  (You might try hooking up just the
   negative pole.)
3) Don't upload or download files.
4) Don't store files on floppy disks or hard disks.
5) Don't read messages.  Not even this one!
6) Don't use serial ports, modems, or phone lines.
7) Don't use keyboards, screens, or printers.
8) Don't use switches, CPUs, memories, microprocessors, or mainframes.
9) Don't use electric lights, electric or gas heat or airconditioning,
   running water, writing, fire, clothing, or the wheel.

I'm sure if we are all careful to follow these 9 easy steps, this
virus can be eradicated, and the precious electronic fluids of our
computers can be kept pure.

Subj:   For Desperado

&gt;From the "Ask the Globe" column in the February 22 issue of the Boston
Globe comes this vital information, poor grammar and all:

        Q.  Is there a "method" for eating animal crackers?

        A.  A spokesman for the National Biscuit Co. (Nabisco), which
        in 1902 introduced Animal Crackers in those little circus boxes
        with the string handle (the boxes themselves were supposed to
        be used as Christmas tree ornaments), there is no actual
        etiquette for eating the goodies.  However, based on hundreds
        of letters to the company, it is known that children prefer to
        nibble first on the back legs, then the forelegs, then the
        head, and lastly the body.  For the record, a box of Nabisco
        Animal Crackers contains 17 animals in 18 different shapes;
        bear crackers come sitting or walking.  The other animals are
        bison, camel, cougar, elephant, giraffe, gorilla, hippopotamus,
        hyena, kangaroo, lion, monkey, rhinoceros, seal, sheep, tiger
        and zebra.

As a side note, I could probably start a war by pointing out that
Sunshine copied Nabisco and sells its own *different* animal crackers,
but they're nowhere near as good.

                        TWO ON BASS; TWENTY ON DISNEY

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    I got two portmanteau (look it up) CD albums for Christmas this year.
    Each had a transcendent cut (the only kind he is capable of) by Aaron
    Neville, the Human Leslie.  (AN's only hit is "Tell It Like It Is", but
    you could do worse for your only hit.  He tours with his brothers. They
    call themselves the Neville Brothers.)

    First album: _Duets_ by Rob Wasserman.  Rob is a bass player.  Here, he
    teams up with eight different singers.  The duets are not just a voice
    and a bass.  Both instruments are multitracked and there are some super
    sounds here.  Rob recorded Aaron Neville doing "Stardust" first, then
    took it around to a lot of other singers and said, "You can be on the
    same album with this.  Wanna do it?"

    Here's who did:

    Rickie Lee Jones: "The Moon is Made of Gold" and "Autumn Leaves".  RLJ
    is in great voice and sounds nothing like Edie Brickhead.  The latter
    song is CD only.

    Bobbie McFerrin:  "Brothers".  Mouth and body sounds.  BMcF has a
    wonderful style, but he has nothing to say.  Here he is called upon to
    say nothing, which works out fine.

    Lou Reed: "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)".  LR was born
    to sing this song.  Done with multiple electric basses.

    Jennifer Warnes: "Ballad of the Runaway Horse".  The horse is Jesus or
    her boyfriend or something, maybe a horse even, but it's a beautiful
    song.  A Leonard Cohen song, as I might have suspected.

    Dan Hicks: "Gone With the Wind".  The obligatory clunker, sung in a
    faux-bop style.  Maybe I hate it because I am so familiar with the
    Billie Holiday version.

    Cheryl Bentyne:  "Angel Eyes".  Woo.  Manhattan Transfer, right?

    Stephane Grapelli:  "Over the Rainbow".  Django Reinhardt's fiddler.

    Aaron Neville: "Stardust".  Oh me oh my.  Aaron Neville alone can cut a
    choir; multi-tracked you might think you've never heard group singing
    before.

    The other CD is "Stay Awake", a collection of tunes from Disney films.
    Aaron Neville sings the Mickey Mouse March theme with Dr. John on
    piano.  Other highlights of this one (done by the guy who did the
    similar Kurt Weill, Nino Rota, and Thelonius Monk portmanteaus):

    Los Lobos doing "I Wan'na Be Like You", sung by the king of the monkeys
    in _Jungle_Book_ with some tasty bari sax from Steve Berlin and massed
    plucked strings from the Lobos.  The monkey wants to become a man, which
    requires control of fire, "man's red flower".  Early nukes song.

    NRBQ doing "Whistle While You Work" wonderfully well.

    The 'Mats doing "Cruella DeVille".

    Syd Straw singing "Blue Shadows on the Trail".  Who is Syd?  Please
    tell me so I can run off with her.  [I just found out you can hear more
    of Syd on the Golden Palominos albums.  What other kind of palominos
    are there?]

    Buster Poindexter and the Banshees of Blue:  "Castles in Spain".

    Sun Ra and his Solar Arkestra:  "Pink Elephants on Parade".  Sun Ra has
    simply pretended that the big swing band has continued to evolve over
    the past 40 years while everybody else thought it was a dead genre.
    Wonderful sounds of whole band singing the silly song.  "Technicolor
    pachyderms are really too much for me."

    Bonnie Raitt and Was (Not Was) on "Baby of Mine".  Very pretty.
    Changes it from a lullabye to a love song.

    Harry Nilsson:  "Zip-a-dee-doo-da".  Of course.

    James Taylor:  "Second Star on the Right".  I din't think I'd like it
    but I did.

    Sinead O'Connor:  "Some Day My Prince Will Come".  Washes all the
    hopefulness out and leaves a very sad song behind.  Moving.

    Ringo winds up with "When You Wish Upon a Star" with Herb Alpert
    trumpet solo.

    There are a number of clunkers on this one, and, annoyingly, most of
    them are stuck in "medlies" so you can't program the CD around them.
    You'll want to listen to "Hi-Ho-Hi-Ho" by Tom Waits maybe once (or .5)
    and some of the others (Ken Nordine, Garth Hudson, Yma Sumac) not at
    all, but what's left is pretty good, including some instrumentals by
    people none of us have ever heard of.

    PS - If you've read this far and feel ever so slightly baffled, a
    Leslie is one of those rotating speakers that make Hammond organs sound
    so cool and The 'Mats are The Replacements, the only band that 'mats.

Subj:   solitons

 Ocean waves rise with the swirling winds.
  They build, then break upon the shore.
    Powerful forces contend here -- one  bulldozes the waters toward
      magnificent crests.
        The other disperses those crests into harmless eddies in the
          sand.
            When the wave height is just right, the forces of dispersion
              are cancelled out.
                The resulting wave holds its shape for an unusually long
                  time, and even suvives collisions with other waves intact.
                        That special wave, or pulse, is a soliton.

    Scientists have been studying solitons produced by water waves for
    about a quarter-century. And since the early 1970's, AT&amp;T Bell
    Laboratories scientists have worked at creating and understanding
    another kind of soliton -- one produced by waves of light.

    In recent experiments, a train of soliton pulses has travelled as
    far as 6000 kilometers, over optical fiber, maintaining it's
    original shape all the way. Scientists now believe the soliton could
    become the basis of a repeaterless lightwave transmission system.
    Light pulses could go thousands of miles without signal
    regeneration.

    But this almost never happened. Back in the 70s, few understood the
    dispersive properties of optical fiber. Most people working with
    optical fiber were unaware of the possibility of optical solitons.

    The reasoning ran this way: In fiber,the speed of light is
    determined by frequency -- the number of oscillations in a second. A
    wave, or pulse, of light actually contains many different
    frequencies. Since the higher-frequency components of the signal
    probably move faster than the lower-frequency components, the
    pulses's natural tendency should be to disperse. Dispersion, then,
    would impose a natural limit on the information-carrying capacity of
    optical fiber.

    But, Bell Labs Akira Hasegawa recognised in 1973 that the speed of
    light in fiber depends on intensity. Intensity could be used to
    cancel the effects of dispersion, creating a soliton.

    Hasegawa had come to study optical solitons as a result of his work
    with "Whistler waves" -- electromagnetic waves produced by
    lightning. An understanding of this and other types of
    electromagnetic waves was important to Bell Labs sattelite research
    at that time.

    A Japanese scientist, T.Taniuti had identified soliton pulses in
    Whistler waves in the late 1960s. Hasegawa expanded on Taniuti's
    work by identifying the range of frequencies in which these Whistler
    waves could form.

    Hasegawa realized that Whistler wave solitons were different from
    ocean wave solitons in an important way. Ocean wave solitons form in
    continous up-and-down patterns. But Whistler waves come in short
    bursts, with a number of waves in each burst. Whistler wave solitons
    are formed by the outline of these bursts.

    Since lightwaves in optical fibers also produce these bursty waves,
    Hasegawa was able  to use his understanding of Whistler waves to
    posit the existence of two types of optical solitons.

    One type, "bright solitons", could exist in light with a wavelength
    of 1.3 microns or more. (A micron is about a thousanth of a
    millimeter.) The other type , "dark solitons", can be formed in
    light with a wavelength of 1.3 microns or less. Dark solitons were
    identified experimentally in 1987, but it's the bright solitons that
    hold the most potential for communications.

    Hasegawa's reasoning turned out to be several years ahead of
    technology. It takes special low-loss optical fibers to create
    pulses at the wavelength bright solitons require. In 1973, that
    fiber hadn't even been invented yet. It wasn't until 1980, when
    technology finally caught up with Hasegawa's vision, that another
    Bell Labs scientist Linn Mollenauer, began creating optical
    solitons. He and his colleagues started with short lengths of fiber,
    one kilometer or less, proving first that solitons existed, then
    documenting their unique properties.

    Mollenauer made further progress in the lab once he and his team
    began using something called the "Raman effect". That's a way to use
    a shorter wavelength of light to strengthen or amplify a longer
    wavelength light. In other words, as Mollenauer says, "We found a
    way to turn the fiber into its own distributed amplifier, creating a
    fiber with no net loss. One we had done that, it was very easy to
    transmit pulses over very long fiber paths".

    Those fiber paths have grown into thousands of kilometers, with no
    end in sight. But Mollenauer is quick to point out that there are
    still practical problems to be solved before optical solitons can
    become part of a working lightwave system.

    For example, his lab uses special color center lasers as pumps to
    produce the Raman effect. Mollenauer wants to replace these lasers
    with semiconductor diode lasers similar to the ones used in today's
    communications systems. Semiconductor diode lasers have the virtue
    of being inexpensive, but Mollenauer hasn't used them in the past
    because their power output is too low. He hopes that new high-power
    semiconductor diode lasers under development will fill the bill.

    There may already be residual benefits from the work that's been
    done. Mollenauer notes that colleagues of his who work in optical
    computing are interested in an optical loop that his lab invented to
    simulate long-distance transmission. They think it might be the
    basis of a memory-storage device in a light-based computer.

    Whatever the application, it's clear that scientists and
    communications equipment manufacturers see a bright future for
    solitons. And it's also clear, says Mollenauer, that, "with solitons
    in the picture, some former 'fundamental limits' may not be limits
    after all".

There's magic in the air, there's magic everywhere.  I don't know what it
was, dear weaders, but this last one really cured the Midwinter Jicker for
me.  Glad you made it this far, if you did.  Have a nice dream,

PS -- When I wrote this out, it turned out to have 666 lines.  Can't
have that.  The house the millionaires bought for Ronald Reagan had a
street address of 666, but it was changed to 668.  Prudence is my
middle name (sure), so I added this little bit to change the line count.
