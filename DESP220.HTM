                                    TRADE RAT

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        I've just switched cubbies,a move of about 10 feet.  I moved
        myself over a period of days, starting with the books and ending
        with the workstation.  Some thieving son of a bitch, trolling the
        corridors looking for anything not nailed down, helped himself to
        a half dozen books.

        This was a literate thief.  He took a Webster's New Collegiate, a
        Rand-McNally atlas, a book of short stories by Robert Walser, "All
        the President's Men" by Woodward and Bernstein, and the Pelican
        history of classical music in the nineteenth century, and last
        year's World Almanac.

        And, just to top off the unpleasantness of the whole affair, this
        thieving son of a bitch took all these nice books and left behind
        a copy of "Minicomputer Systems" by Richard Eckhouse, revealing
        all the inner secrets of the PDP-11, like the trade rat who steals
        a shiny watch and leaves a pebble behind.

        All puns, by all authors, are intended.  When people say, "no pun
        intended", that's just them calling attention to the clever pun
        they just noticed in something they wrote.

        Puns are natural in English because of our receptivity to words
        from many different languages.  What gives puns a bad name is the
        idiotic idle pun of the sort where "Me too!" is echoed by "Me
        three!" Autodidacts and newspapers (nondidacts) are the worst
        offenders here.  On the other hand, the only joke Jesus Christ ever
        made was a pun.

                                    =*=

        "BASIC:  A one-word oxymoron."  Extremely Zen definition from one
        of those computer dictionary things, this particular one compiled
        at the University of Alaska.

                                    =*=

        A horrible experience I hope you missed.  Bob Hope, wearing some
        sort of peculiar surgical trousers encasing his mishmosh lower
        torso with multiple criss-crossed cloth belts, being interviewed
        by the ineffable Howard Stern about his sex life, justa coupla
        smarmballs smarming away.

        Stern:  So, Bob, back before you were married &lt;heavy emphasis&gt;,
        you had all the girls you wanted, right?

        Hope:  I had to beat them off the running board of my car.  Nobody
        knows what a running board is any more. &lt;sadly&gt;

        Stern:  If you wanted three girls, you could have 'em.

        Hope:  I had all I needed. &lt;sadly&gt;

        Stern:  Back before you were married, you could have three girls
        if you wanted them, right?

        This was as much as I could stand.  I clicked away and there on
        the next channel was another Howard Stern chatting up Chrissie
        Hynde.  She made the *horrible* *error* of making a sort of kissy
        mouth at Howard and he was across the table like a flash, tongue
        at the ready.  Chrissie really didn't want to be in the same
        universe with him at that point and neither did I.

        I clicked back and there was the previous-universe Howard Stern,
        by now talking to Dr. Ruth!  Oh the horror!  After one word out of
        *her* smarmy mouth (which was "sex", for those who are tracking
        this issue) I managed to click in the other direction.
        Fortunately, there was a Richard Simmons special on the next
        channel so I settled down for some wholesome viewing.

        And then, in the current Spy, we find the revelation that Bob Hope
        has 400 pairs of trousers and also woke up the Spy interviewer (who
        was staying at Hope's *ridiculously* large house in Palm Springs)
        to get up and go girl-chasing at 2 am.  No mention of running
        boards, or of whether they scored.  The last line in the Spy piece
        is Hope pointing out three girls to the interviewer and asking, "Do
        you feel lucky tonight?"  Ah, Howard, where were you?

        (I do remember, by the way, when Bob Hope was something other than
        a plague spot.  Painless Potter will live forever in the annals of
        dental science.)

        Sunnunu is apparently something else.  His famous IQ rating is a
        product of having sent in a coupon from Omni Magazine and he is
        flushed with pride at being a member of Mensa.  Personally, if I'd
        been a professor of aeronautical engineering at MIT, I wouldn't
        feel the need for any extra affirmation of my braininess (not that
        I do, anyway), but Sunnunu's real glad he sent in that coupon.

        And yet, it's not enough.  He also loves to dress people down and
        insult them.  He likes to stick his feet up on his desk in people's
        faces and say things like "I don't have to listen to you.  Nothing
        you could say could possibly be of any interest to me."  A real
        classy ex-governor, of course, would know how to convey all that
        without saying or doing anything visibly untoward, but Sunnunu is
        not that grade.  He threatened to castrate the President of the US
        Chamber of Commerce with a chainsaw.  Real keen, eh?  (I lifted all
        these factoids from the New Republic, BTW.)

                                    =*=

        Go see "Soapdish".  It should be enough for me to say that Kevin
        Kline is cranking all the way through, even better than in "A Fish
        Called Wanda", but everybody else is cranking too, even the
        previously uncrankable Sally Field.  This is the kind of film
        "they" supposedly "don't make" any more, but they made this one and
        at one or two points I was afraid to look at the screen for fear
        I'd see something else and the old gut would actually split.  The
        $100,000 wave alone is worth the price of the ticket (at a matinee,
        anyway).

#THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION has put an end to an era by locking
traditionally free network access to its computers, after the group was
victimized by electronic vandals.  The foundation is working on a
freely-distributable operating system, word processor, spreadsheet, and
other programs.  Founder Richard Stallman says the goal of creating free
software is the main reason he didn't close the foundation after the
security change.  --New York Times 7/28

Tom, I just finished reading (and enjoying) 3047.  There's a note of a
fellow named Chris Chandler who published a cassette tape.  The phone
number is 617-492-xxxx.  I phoned to get a copy and he no longer lives
there.  Too bad.  sounded interesting.

        This was the guy who had the song out called "Bush Lite".  Hmm,
        last nonth I published the thing about the Soviet newsgroups and
        they disappeared.  Last ish I publish something about an anti-Bush
        song and the singer disappears.

        Maybe I should publish things about the CIA/DIA/NSA and they might
        disappear and stop reading my mail.  (Just kidding, spys!)

        Actually, they're probably not paying any attention at all.  The
        White House has hired someone at approximately $47,000 a month to
        watch "Saturday Night Live" and the Carson and Letterman shows and
        then summarize them for Eyes Only The Prez.  I would do it for
        $36,000 a month, as long as I didn't have to talk to the President.
        Or the Vice President.  Or James Baker.  Or Sunnunu.  Is there a
        pattern here?

        Well, when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks sort of

One the somewhat more crude side (in response to being flashed the bird):

        What's that, your IQ, sperm count, or number of married parents?

Lots of variations on this one where I came from.  The above was one of

Under a topic about computerized "virtual reality" sex, you say:

"Don't get me wrong, I'd love to don the helmet and glove".

What's the glove for?

That's not really for print - though I don't forbid it - but I didn't
understand  what the glove was for, and my first thought was NOT edifying.
What IS the  glove for, anyway?

        re: "Two bricks shy of a load"
I've heard that in Australia (from when they had english-type money), they
often  used a comparison to the quid, as in "He's no more than sixpence in
a quid."

A comic in the paper this sunday had a patient in a psychiatrist's couch,
with the top of his head open like a lid.  The psychiatrist was looking
through a  deck of cards and saying "Well, no wonder.  You're missing a six
of diamonds and  a jack of spades."

        Most artificial reality thingies use a helmet to provide audio and
        video input and information on where the subject is looking and a
        glove to allow for a degree of manual interaction, you know,
        pushing buttons, opening doors, sword-fighting, and so forth.

We apparently also missed some of Saddam's nuclear stash, but at least

to promote the agenda it hasn't got.

Subj:   engineers vs. THE WORLD!!!
Subj:   Engineering today :-)
Subj:   The obvious answer is to get rid of the engineer
Subj:   You see, the map is in French and out of date....

&lt;many forwards removed...&gt;

This play concerns 1 engineer and 5 non-engineers (Marketing, Management
etc.)  It is an extended analogy, and speculates on the interaction if the
goal were nothing as hard to understand as software development, but
something much simpler.  It is intended to put the problems in the software
industry into a more realistic perspective than the usual attempts to solve
them do.

Engineer:      So I understand that the task is to transport 12 people from
               their current location to the house of John Smith.
Non-engineer1: That's right.  What do you need to do this?
Engineer:      Well, that depends on where John Smith's house is and
               on where the 12 people are.
Non-engineer1: The 12 people are at headquarters in Cambridge Massachusetts.
Non-engineer2: The location of John Smith's house is a technical question.
               Potential changes in the market imply we should not narrow
               ourselves to an answer to that just now.  Propose a solution
               that will work for all possible locations,
Engineer:      But that makes it an almost impossible problem.
Non-engineer1: Now to return to the question of what you need...
Engineer:      What I need depends on the location of John Smith's house.
Non-engineer3: Oh, John Smith's house is in Springfield, I'm sure of it.
Engineer:      Is that Springfield Massachusetts?  or Springfield Illinois?
Non-engineer3: What difference does it make?  Springfield is Springfield!
Non-engineer4: Well actually, he said he lived in Boston.
Non-engineer3: Boston?  No I am SURE he said Springfield.
Non-engineer1: Is it possible that he meant the Boston-area?
Non-engineer2: And we want the transportation to be handicapped accessible.
Non-engineer4: Well, not in the first release.
Non-engineer3: Right, leave that as a future improvement.
Engineer:      I'm going to make the simplifying assumption that the John
               Smith whose house is the destination lives in the city of
               Springfield that is closest to Boston, thus arguably in
               the Boston-area, thus that John Smith lives in Springfield
               Massachusetts, and that the transportation need not be
               handicapped accessible.  Okay?
Non-engineer4: Are you sure it was not James Jones whose house was the
               destination?
Non-engineer1: No, we all agree it's John Smith.
Engineer:      So, SUBJECT to my simplifying assumption, I will need a
               transportation vehicle that seats at least 12 people.
Non-engineer2: 12 people?  That's non-standard!  That'll takes us a while.
Non-engineer1: It fits in the "buying externally visible things" budget.
               We can manage it.
Engineer:      I'll also need a map of Massachusetts.
Non-engineer1: That is an "paper things" expense, and we have frozen all
               "paper things" expenses.  I'm afraid you'll have to do
               without that.
Engineer:      I guess I can make do.
Non-engineer:  We'll let you know in a week.

(3 weeks later)
NE1:  Here is your transportation vehicle.  We have EXCEEDED your standards!
Eng; Exceeded?  Oh really?
N1:  Yes.  Here is a transportation vehicle that seats MORE than 12 people!
     It seats 40 people!  A 1968 bluebird schoolbus.
Eng: Oh, a nonstandard bus, huh,  I can work with that.
NE1: How long until you can propose a solution?
Eng: Give me a day to look over the bus.
(1 day later)
Eng: We have a problem.  This bus has no engine.
NE1: No engine?  Well, you didn't specify that the vehicle have an engine.
Eng: If it does not have an engine then it will not serve as a transportation
     vehicle.
NE1: Well do the best you can.
Eng: Well I cannot very well transport people in a vehicle without an engine.
NE4: Could you push it?
Eng: Can we BUY a second-hand engine?
NE2: No, our "buying slightly expensive second-hand things" budget is used up.
Eng: Can we buy it using the same money as we bought the bus with?
NE1: No, an engine is not externally visible,
     but our "buying little things" budget still has
     money.  Can we buy all the pieces of an engine and assemble it?
Eng: Who's "we"?  I cannot assemble an engine myself.  If you have money for
     little things, let's buy a map.  Can't you get me a roadworthy
     transportation vehicle somehow?  It would be the easiest solution.
NE1: No map.  Too expensive.
NE2: Well, if we can find a vehicle the meets the company's standards...
     If you are actually going to drive in it on public roads,
     it has to be safe enough.
NE3: Well, maybe our "Replace old things with better things" budget has money.
NE2: That is possible.
NE1: Well, look into it.
NE2: I shall.
(6 weeks later)
NE2: We HAVE a roadworthy vehicle for you.  A 1974 VW Bug.
Eng: But that does not seat 12 people.
NE2: So make two trips.
Eng: Three trips.
NE2: Look, the details are YOUR problem.
NE1: Did you solve the "map issue"?
Eng: Yes, I borrowed a map from my old college room-mate.
NE2: So it did not impact your delivery schedule.
Eng: Delivery schedule?  no.  Possibly quality.  You see, the map is in
     French and out of date, and is written for bicyclers, so my information
     is less reliable and it took me more time to read it.
NE1: When can we expect delivery.
Eng: How about tomorrow.

(next day)
Eng: Okay, where are the 12 people?
NE2: Well, we needed the possibility of transporting 12 people, but there
     actually aren't 12 people here.  Only 4 of us need to go.
Eng: So that was not a real requirement.
NE2: Of course it was a requirement.  See it in this document?
(pulls a document from an 18-inch (45 cm) high stack of papers).
NE4: Shall we leave now?
Eng: Yes, let's leave.
NE1: How are we going to fit my wheelchair in a VW Bug?
Eng: You said we didn't NEED handicapped accessible for this release.
NE1: Handicapped accessible, no, but I WANT to roll into the car in my
     wheelchair.
Eng: Into a VW Bug?  How do you expect me to arrange that?
     No, handicapped accessible is in a later release.
     And rolling your wheelchair into the vehicle is part of that.

(They fold and tie the wheelchair to the roof, get in the car and by an
 especially circuitous route because the car does not fit down some
 bicycling paths, arrive at the destination.)

Eng: Here we are, John Smith's house.
NE4: Is this James Jones's house in Illinois?
Eng: No, this is John Smith's house in Springfield, Massachusetts.
NE4: But I thought...
Eng: Did you read the documents?
NE4: No, of course not.

(a day later)
NE1: We have to do something about our methodology.
NE2: Yes, the delivery took much too long, and did not meet requirements.
NE4: Engineers are not productive enough.
NE3: The next time we want to do a transportation project we should
     make the engineer report his progress twice a day instead of daily.
NE1: Yes, that should improve matters.

                         translated from the memoirs of
                              Jean Turing-VonNeuman
                a minor 19th century post-impressionist programer

             I will never forget that Spring, that day.  Paris had an air
        of revolution.  The week before an exhibition of Seraut's
        listings had caused a sensation.  In his unrelenting quest for
        simplicity he had reduced all of programming to three machine
        instructions.  The resulting 6,000 line bubble sort had shocked
        the critics.

             My own recent efforts had been received poorly.  I had cut
        and slashed through my programs, juxtaposing blocks of code in a
        way that exposed the underlying intensity of the algorithm
        without regard to convention or syntax.
             "But it doesn't compile.", they complained.
             As if programming was about adhering to their primitive
        language definitions.  As if it was my duty to live within the
        limits of their antiquated and ordinary compilers.
             So it was that I came that day to La Boite Bleue, seeking
        solace and companionship.

             La Boite Bleue was where we gathered in those days. The wine
        there was cheap, the tables were large and they kept a complete
        set of language manuals behind the bar.
             As I entered I heard Henri's measured accents above the din.
             "...that complexity is not the salient characteristic of
        exemplary style."
             Toulouse-Lautrec was seated at a table spread with greenbar.
        Manet, redfaced, loomed over him.
             "Damm your recursion, Henri.  Iteration, however complex,
        is always more efficient."
             Manet stormed away from the table in the direction of the
        bar.  He always seemed angry at that time.  Partly because his
        refusal to write in anything but FORTRAN isolated him from the
        rest of the Avant-Guarde, partly because people kept confusing
        him with Monet.
             Henri motioned to me to join him at the table.
             "Have you heard from Vincent recently?"

             We were all concerned about Van Gogh.  Only a few days
        before he had completed an order n sorting routine that required
        no additional memory.  Unfortunately, because he had written it in
        C and refused, on principle, to comment his code, no one had
        understood a line of it.  He had not taken it well.

             "No. Why?", I replied.
             "He and Gaugin had a violent argument last night over
        whether a side effect should be considered output and he hasn't
        been seen since.  I fear he may have done something ... rash."

             We were suddenly interrupted by the waitress's terrified
        scream.  I turned in time to see something fall from the open
        envelope she held in her hand.  Stooping to retrieve it, I was
        seized by a wave of revulsion as I recognized that the object in
        my hand, bestially torn from its accustomed place, was the mouse
        from Van Gogh's workstation.  The waitress, who had fainted, lay
        in an unnoticed heap beside me.

             By the evening, the incident had become the talk of Paris.

The Chile Pepper Counterculture
        Robb Walsh, Austin Chronicle

Endorphins, those natural drugs that are 100 to 1,000 times more
powerful than morphene, are released into our brain when we eat hot
chile petters, according to a New Mexico University scientist.  Like
other psychotropics, including peyote, coca and tabacco, chile peppers
alter our state of consciousness.  In the case of chile peppers the
high is non-hallucinogenic, but it is addictive.  Experimental
psychologist Frank Etscorn of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology told the New Mexico Chile Conference that chile addicts are
hooked on endorphins.  "We get slightly strung out, but it's no big
deal," he says.

Getting a runner's high without the running may be a bigger deal than
Etscorn imagines.  It also explains a lot about the perverse
psychology of chile-pepper lovers.  Eating more chile peppers produces
more pain, more pain produces more endorphis.  Maintaining a steady
burn has been called "mouth surfing" by many observers of the emerging
chile pepper counterculture.  The endorphins and physical sensations
that flood the brain when a chile addict bites into a pepper suddenly
interrupt the thought processes and overwhelm the senses.  This
phenomenon has been described by doctors as a "rush."  According to
Dr. Weil, a physician quoted by Austin chile expert Jean Andrews,
chile junkies "glide along on the strong stimulation, experiencing it
as something between pleasure and pain that ... brings on a high state
of consciousuness."

Psychologist Paul Rozin, whose studies on chile-pepper lovers provide
many clues to their behavior, has written that chile eaters have
several motivations.  Chile eating, according to Rozin, is one of
those "benignly masochistic" activities that provide thrills, like
horror movies, swimming in icy water or parachute jumping.  A more
primal motivation for chile eating and a clue to the introduction of
chile peppers into the human diet is the physiological phenomenon
known as "gustatory sweating."

In her book, _Chile Peppers_, author Jan Andrews reviews studies of
gustatory sweating which show that this unique kind of perspiration of
the face and scalp is induced by eating chile peppers in hot weather.
This probably explains the connection between hot food and the
tropics.  But tropical chile eaters get just as hooked on the thrills
as they do on the cooling effects of gustatory sweating.  Although
gustatory sweating does not occur at all in cool weather, once a chile
eater gets hooked, the habit continues regardless of the temperature.
The growth of the chile-pepper counterculture into the far reaches of
the temperate zone seems to indicate that cooling perspiration is not
the only reason people develop the habit.

The chile-pepper counterculture is growing fast; between the early
1970s and the early 1980s, the American Spice Trade Association
reported that imports of all dried red peppers jumped 61 percent.
Chile pepper production in New Mexico has almost doubled.  Thai,
Szechuan, Mexican, Cajun and other hot foods are popular in New
England and Minnesota.  Rumor has it that some former marijuana
smokers who used to grow a few plants in the basement have found a new
use for their growlights and imported bat guano.  They are using the
exotic farm equipment to turn out chile peppers as hot as the ones in
the tropics.  There's something happening here.

Faith Popcorn, the Madison Avenue marketing-trend analyst to Fortune
500 companies, has identified this trend as part of the "cocooning"
super trend.  People are staying at home and seeking "thrills" they
can experience without going anywhere.  Exotic food, especcially hot
foods like chile peppers, are replacing the more exotic kinds of
"adventures" that the baby boomers have given up to stay home with the
kids.

Can you hurt yourself with jalapenos?  According to the United States
Dispensatory, "Capsicum [chile pepper] is a local stimulant... that
differs from other local irritants in producing practically
no reddening of the skin even where there is a very severe subjective
sensation; while it has a pronounced irritant effect on the endings of
the sensatory nerves, it has little action upon capillary or other
blood vessels.  Therefore it does not cause blistering, even in high
concentrations."

In fact, peppers have many medicinal benefits.  The Mayans and other
Indian cultures used hot peppers for respiratory problems.  Peppers
are expectorants--they aid congestion and digestion by causing more
throat secretions.  Hot peppers have also been found to aid in
dissolving blood clots.  Most importantly, they are a better source of
Vitamin C and A than most other fruits and vegetables.  In fact the
Hungarian scientist who won a Nobel Prize for discovering Vitamin C
relied on paprika peppers as a source for large amounts of the
substance.

There are some scientists who feel that peppers my cause some damage
to the stomach and taste buds, but they are in the minority.
Gastroenterologists in India report inflammation using pure capsicin,
the heat-producing chemical substance in peppers.  Studies by Paul
Rozin have shown that people used to eating lots of peppers lose some
ability to detect the heat after awhile.  That is, in laboratory
testing, hot-pepper lovers culdn't detect any heat at all when given
chile extract in extremely low concentrations, while regular subjects
could.  You can conclude from this that a tolerance to chiles is
acquired.  But to say that some damage is caused, some tastebud
burnout has occurred, is a more suspect conclusion.  It is the pain
receptors in the mouth that detect chiles, not the taste buds.
Capsaicin, the chemical causing the burn, is completely tasteless.

The overwhelming body of opinion indicates that the pain of peppers is
intense but causes no real damage.  That's why blistering or reddening
is not associated with pepper pain.  People with ulcers should avoid
peppers because of the effect peppers have on gastric secretions.
Peppers cause more digestive juices to flow, but it is the stomach
liquid, not the pepper itself, that will aggravate the ulcer.  Of
course, from a pure pain point-of-view, eating chile peppers when you
have an ulcer is not a good idea anyway.  But otherwise, don't worry
about hurting yourself eating chile peppers.

The chemical capsicin is fooling your nerves into believing that they
are burning in hell, when in fact nothing is wrong with them at all.
And your dumb body rushes all those painkillers to those special
receptors in the brain.  That's a pretty good practical joke, huh?
Pass the hot sauce.

&gt;From Editor Charles Peters' "Tilting at Windmills" column:

When Dick Cheney fired Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Dugan last fall,
the press was, as Scott Suger noted in these pages, remarkably incurious as
to whether or not we were losing a good man.  In fact, the remarks that got
Dugan fired included the most prescient analysis I've seen of what would be
the key factors in the war.

"[Iraq's] air force has very limited capability. . . . They did not
distinguish themselves in the war against Iran. . . . Iraq's  [army] is
incompetent. . . . Unlike Vietnam, we can win through air power because
there is not much jungle where we're going. . . . Ground forces mau be
needed to occupy Kuwait, but only after air power has so shattered enemy
resistance that soldiers can walk in and not have to fight house-to-house."
Does this sound familiar--like maybe exactly how things worked out? . . .

  From desperado 3044, Judy Anderson's piece in rec.humor.funny reports
  that "the default uninitialized value for registers on the IBM RS/6000
  under AIX is hex -21524111. Printed out as a 32-bit unsigned quantity,
  this is: DEADBEEF". Actually, IBM has used this value to fill
  uninitialized fields of all sorts for a long time (aside from being
  cute, it also helps when debugging). The earliest I recall seeing it
  was in the early '70s (OS/360 days), but it may be even older than
  that.

  What may be even more surprising to folks who seem unaware that IBM
  still probably sells more computers and SW than all other companies
  combined, is that this sort of humor is scattered all over IBM
  products, in places generally only visible to systems programmers and
  IBM engineers. Some of the comments in the almost-all-assembly-
  language source code for the VM370 monitor were really choice, though
  I can't remember any of them. Even the apparently dead-serious "This
  page intentionally left blank" is a form of the dry IBM sense of
  humor.

Someone here received this from a friend at Caltech:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I had an experience Saturday night which I must confess confused me a bit.
As best I can understand it, I was accused by a dog of smuggling drugs.   I was
driving back from Palomar in a Caltech motor pool car.   After I had been waved
through the Border Patrol checkpoint on interstate 15, I was pulled over and
the car was searched.   When I asked why I was pulled over, I was informed
the dog "showed interest" in my car.   The dog was back at the checkpoint.
I had been waved through the check point, and I doubt my speed ever dropped
below 5 mph.   The traffic was bumper-to-bumper.   So I guess this wonder-pooch
can isolate the exact drug-laden vehicle even when it passes by at 7 feet per
second.   Even more impressive is the fact that Fido's sense of smell evidently
includes depth perception.   I know this because my car was isolated even
though two lanes of traffic were passing briskly through the checkpoint.
I guess the fact that the dog's nose has two nostrils gives it some sort
of binocular effect.

    I don't know what I'm complaining about, anyway.   A drive past a dog is
more due process than most people get.   Besides, if I am dragged into court,
I'm guaranteed the right to cross examine all witnesses against me.   I think
that's in the 6th amendment, but they may have re-numbered them after the
4th amendment was thrown out.   I could haul Spot's leaf encrusted butt right
up to that witness box, and question her.   If I could trip up her testimony,
I'd sue the collar off that bitch.   She'd never see the outside of a kenel
again!   Even if I lost, I could write a book about it.   I think I'd call it
"Prince of the City".

    I can't begin to express just how happy I am that aminals are now being
recruited into law-enforcement!   We need more Pet Police.   Perhaps a
parrot could Mirandize suspects:

    "brrrAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWkkkk!!! You have the right to remain silent
     AAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWKKK!!!   Pretty-Cop! Pretty-Cop!"

Some animals might have trouble passing the Civil Service exams.   But if
that's a problem, the exams could be species-normalized.

    I sure hope more animals enter the justice system.   President Bush
could make an important symbolic jesture by nominating Millie the
White House Dog to fill the recently vacated Supreme Court seat.

Subj:   English Professor Ecko

Hi there.  I saw this in FidoNews, the weekly newsletter of FidoNet, and
thought you might get a kick out of it.  (An "echo" is to FidoNet what a
newsgroup is to Usenet.)

                     The English Professor Echo

The English Professor echo is for anyone who wants to learn, practice,
or just brush up on there English skills. Here is a brief idea of
what this echo will provide: It will correct your grammar mistakes so
you do not keep repeating the same ones over and over again. If you
have a report due for school and need help developing it. If you need
help with developing a presentation or you just want to converse about
the English language, than this echo is for you!

Subj:   I thought this was bizarre enough to send along...

    I found this in People magazine while waiting for my clothes to dry:

    CHAIR LEADERS
    America's oddest drill team
    has come a lawn way, baby

    From Vail, Colo., they came, simple men with a dream.  And lawn chairs.
    Children, small animals and adults stared when the Vail Precision Lawn
    Chair Drill Team first revealed itself at the Fourth of July parade in
    1984.  Amid the floats, a squad of guys in Hawaiian shirts, shorts and
    sunglasses strutted their way through a beer-bellied parody of military
    weapons drill.  Instead of rifles, they twirled, tapped and tossed lawn
    chairs.  And they chanted: "Got myself a new beach chair/This is where
    I park my rear...Boom chugga lugga lugga, boom!"

    The Vail crowd went wild, especially when the team lobbed water
    balloons at the onlookers and hit former President Gerald Ford.

    From that semimythic beginning, the group's fame grew.  Their very
    first road trip, in 1985, took them to Manhattan...Kansas.  Then came
    the Saint Patrick's Day parade in Kansas City, Mo., Founders Day Parade
    in North Attleboro, Mass., NBA halftime shows in Denver and conventions
    around the country.  Last October they filmed a 30-second Miller Lite
    commercial for which each earned $1,928--union scale.

    Why would nine grown men: Craig Campbell, Gary Pesso, Will Lewis, Kirk
    Kennedy, Nick Svoboda, Brian Hesterlee, Jeff Atencio, Gary Howe and
    Richard Carnes--whose ages range from 24 to 39 and whose real-life
    careers include photographer and lumber inspector--do this?  "We
    originally started it to meet [sic] girls," says Campbell, 33, a
    founding chair man who works in a Vail country club.  "Now some of us
    are married, and we do it to meet girls."

        I am handicapped as a satirist, carping critic, collector and
        distributor of various wry and sundry things, by having a sarcastic
        and cynical head somehow mismatched with a tender heart.  I
        wouldn't hurt you for the world, even though I probably don't even
        know who you are, and I certainly don't endorse everything I send
        out, but the real subject of Desperado is life's rich pageant and
        you may not like everything that life throws up.

        Take me for instance.  Yirrgacheffe is my favorite coffee.  When I
        asked the Coffee Connection clerk how to pronounce it, he said,
        "Pronounce it so it sounds foreign."  La Minita Peaberry does
        nothing for me.

        Hold 'em in the road.

        Yr. bdy,
