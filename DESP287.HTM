 At one point in a good college education you run a chance of being
 convinced by reading Proudhon that "Property is theft".  Although I
 don't see what I can do about it (and I love working in my yard) the
 old French anarchist was probably right.  My corollary is,
 "Government is murder".  I don't know what to do about that either.
 These are two principles that make the world work.

 Last week the family of "white separatist Randall Weaver" was paid
 $3.1 million for the shooting death of Weaver's wife, Vicki.  The
 government move was announced in a press release and did not mention
 that Weaver's 14-year-old son had been killed with a shot in the back
 nor that Vicki had been holding a ten-month-old baby when a sniper
 blew off half her head.

 The government press release stated, "By entering into a settlement,
 the United States hopes to take a substantial step toward healing the
 wounds the incident inflicted."

 This is what people mean when they say language goes dead in the
 hands of the powerful.  When you're dead, your wounds never heal. The
 wounds the press release was speaking of were the merely metaphorical
 wounds suffered by the government in this disgraceful "incident".

 The only white people Randall Weaver ever separated were members of
 his own family.  The crime that led the US Marshalls and the FBI to
 his door was selling two sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent
 who then unsuccessfully attempted to blackmail Weaver into informing
 on others.  Weaver's refusal to do so led to all the other charges
 and to the unprovoked attack on his home.  Just as with the Branch
 Davidians, the feds started by shooting the dogs around the house.

 This stuff has been much on my mind since Waco and very much so since
 the Oklahoma City bombing.  Other words will tumble out sooner or
 later, all about what it means to die for your country.

 I've been slow to publish it because it's going to offend people I

 With a single gallon of gasoline, a large number of people can get
 cranked out of their skulls sniffing it and then use that same gallon
 to blow up a fair-sized building.  This is why drug control and
 weapon control don't/won't/can't work.

As a further example of how the male brain is reduced to a dried
raisin via erotic thoughts, there was a prostitute crackdown (no
pun intended) in some small midwestern town a few years back.
Worried about lawsuits brought about on "entrapment" charges, the
town council, in their wisdom, ruled that these strictures had to
be met before any cops posing as prossies were brought into the
field....

1)  All hooker-impersonating cops must wear a police hat.

2)  Said hat must have the word "police" written on it in large
gold letters.

3)  Said cops must tell the john, if asked, that they are indeed
police and will arrest the john if they proposition them.

....they caught three people."

 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 For the past few issues, I've been quoting Samuel Beckett:  "Every
 word is an uneccessary stain on silence and nothingness."  With a good
 editor, Samuel might have said, reducing the stain, "Every word is a
 stain on silence and nothingness.
