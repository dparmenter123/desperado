    "Voyager Update" they had a little counter showing the seconds
    to closest approach:

Subj:   Good thing NASA developed those "heavy boots"!

    From USENET (forwards deleted):

    From:       DECWRL::"hoqax!lmg@att.att.com"    7-SEP-1989 19:18:40.69

    I thought you would enjoy this one from USENET:

============================================================================

    About 6-7 years ago, I was in a philosophy class at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison (good science/engineering school) and the
teaching assistant was explaining Descarte.  He was trying to show how
things don't always happen the way we think they will and explained
that, while a pen always falls when you drop it on Earth, it would
just float away if you let go of it on the Moon.

    My jaw dropped a little.  I blurted "What?!"  Looking around the
room, I saw that only my friend Mark and one other student looked
confused by the TA's statement.  The other 17 people just looked at me
like "What's your problem?"

    "But a pen would fall if you dropped it on the Moon, just more
slowly."  I protested.

    "No it wouldn't." the TA explained calmly, "because you're too far
away from the Earth's gravity."

    Think.  Think.  Aha!  "You saw the APOLLO astronauts walking around
on the Moon, didn't you?"  I countered, "why didn't they float away?"

    "Because they were wearing heavy boots."  he responded, as if this
made perfect sense (remember, this is a Philosophy TA who's had
plenty of logic classes).

    By then I realized that we were each living in totally different
worlds, and did not speak each others language, so I gave up.  As we
left the room, my friend Mark was raging.  "My God!  How can all those
people be so stupid?"

    I tried to be understanding.  "Mark, they knew this stuff at one
time, but it's not part of their basic view of the world, so they've
forgotten it.  Most people could probably make the same mistake."

    To prove my point, we went back to our dorm room and began
randomly selecting names from the campus phonebook.  We called about
30 people and asked each this question:

        1. If you're standing on the Moon holding a pen, and you let go,
           will it a) float away, b) float where it is, or c) fall to the
           ground?

    About 47 percent got this question correct.  Of the ones who got
it wrong, we asked the obvious follow-up question:

        2. You've seen films of the APOLLO astronauts walking around on the
           Moon, why didn't they fall off?

    About 20 percent of the people changed their answer to the first
question when they heard this one!  But the most amazing part was that
about half of them confidently answered, "Because they were wearing
heavy boots."

The Parmenter node name, that is.  In DECnet syntax, it almost shouts,
" [ HUMPTY ] DUMPT_Parmenter."  Well, maybe ya hadda be there.

Anyway, that's not what I called about.

The "The Metro" news item about exploding toilets in Seattle and that
other place, wherever it is down there in the South somewhere, is yet
one more evidence that there's nothing really new under the sun.

Way back in the 1880s Seattle had exploding toilets.  This was before
they hauled in all that landfill and built the city up off its mudflat,
which they did a few years after they burned the city down.

The story goes that when the tide came in a little too enthusiastically
the sewers, which ran straight down to Puget Sound, would back up with
more than the usual vigor.  Although the restrooms in stores were often
on little enclosed platforms well above floor level, it wasn't enough.
They say that newcomers to the city were known, not entirely without
cause, as wetbacks.

No argument here--apparently, it's the husband's brain that stops.

The new Miss America reportedly has three missions in life:  (1)
 to encourage self-empowerment, (2) to help the environment, and
  (3) to promote the use of animals in laboratory experiments.

To these ends, she has shown reporters her collection of jarred
 animal fetii.  Dave Barry wouldn't make this up if you paid him.

Coming soon:  a lawsuit against PETA, culminating in a Constitu-
 tional amendment to ban desecration of Miss America.  You heard
  it here first.

  [...]
  Wednesday night's swimsuit winner was Miss Louisiana,
Stacy King, 23 years old, 5 feet, 5 inches tall and 105
pounds.  King has been entering scholarship pageants since
she was 14.  She has a degree in fashion merchandising
from Louisiana Technical University and is engaged in
further studies leading to a bachelor's degree in dental
hygiene.

  Her lifetime goal is to combine these two fields by
designing nicer uniforms for dental hygienists.

    This is just confirmation of my long-standing suspicion that somewhere
    (quite possibly in the tunnels at MIT) there is not just an X-windows cell,
    but a sly, sinister, super-powerful "X" agency devoted to foisting all
    kinds of strange, savage software on an unsuspecting but mysteriously
    willing-to-buy-it world.  My list so far consists of

                        X-windows
                        TeX
                        UniX

    these names. Who knows of others?  Or are they "unknown" at this time.

In a previous job selling lisp machines, I was often asked about Unix.  If
the audience was not mixed gender, I would sometimes compare Unix to herpes
- lots of people have it, nobody wants it, they got screwed when they got
it and if they could they would get rid of it.  There would be smiles,
heads would nod and that would usually end the discussion about Unix.

food wasn't even being opened. Somebody finally discovered that is was
because of the picture of the baby on the jar.  The recipients knew that
cans of beans had pictures of beans on the outside, cans of spinach had
pictures of spinach, etc., and nobody would touch the jars with pictures
of babies.

undertake a manned mission to Mars: "Mars is essentially in the
same orbit.  Mars is somewhat the same distance from the sun,
which is very important.  We have seen pictures where there are
canals, we believe, and water.  If there is water, there is

So I read the various language manglings in Desperado yesterday, and then
yesterday afternoon I was in a store looking at a digital stopwatch, and
these were the instructions on how to set the watch for 12 or 24 hour time,
and whether the day or month comes first in the date display:

"Hold A then push B or when time (hour) setting, 12/24 hour cycle option
will appear alternately on every 24 hour cycle during hour advance Month
and Date interchange by holding C then push A or cannot be changed."

Okay, that's a challenge to my assertion that you can always figure out
what the foringeners are trying to say in English.  Maybe with the watch in
hand I could do it.  Sounds like a great interface though.

Someone has put out a true analog watch. It analogizes the sun and earth to
perfection with 24 hours around the rim and only an hour hand. I read it in

                PACHYDERMIC PERSONNEL PREDICTION
                by Peter C. Olsen

                A bold new proposal for matching
                high-technology people and professions

      Over the years, the problem of finding the right person for the
      right job has consumed thousands of worker-years of research and
      millions of dollars in funding.  This is particularly true for
      high-technology organizations where talent is scarce and
      expensive.  Recently, however, years of detailed study by the
      finest minds in the field of psychoindustrial interpersonnel
      optimization have resulted in the development of a simple and
      foolproof test to determine the best match between personality
      and profession.  Now, at last, people can be infallibly assigned
      to the jobs for which they are truly best suited.

      The procedure is simple: Each subject is sent to Africa to hunt
      elephants.  The subsequent elephant-hunting behavior is then
      categorized by comparison to the classification rules outlined
      below.  The subject should be assigned to the general job
      classification that best matches the observed behavior.

      CLASSIFICATION GUIDLINES

      Mathematicians hunt elephants by going to Africa, throwing out
      everything that is not an elephant, and catching one of whatever
      is left.  Experienced mathematicians will attempt to prove the
      existence of at least one unique elephant before proceeding to
      step 1 as a subordinate excercise.  Professors of mathematics
      will prove the existence of at least one unique elephant and then
      leave the detection and capture of an actual elephant as an
      excercise for their graduate students.

      Computer scientists hunt elephants by excercising Algorithm A:
      1. Go to Africa.
      2. Start at the Cape of Good Hope.
      3. Work northward in an orderly manner, traversing the continent
         alternately east and west.
      4. During each traverse pass,
         a. Catch each animl seen.
         b. Compare each animal caught to a known elephant.
         c. Stop when a match is detected.

      Experienced computer programmers modify Algorithm A by placing a
      known elephant in Cairo to ensure that the algorithm will
      terminate.  Assembly language programmers prefer to execute
      Algorithm A on their hands and knees.

      Engineers hunt elephants by going to Africa, catching gray
      animals at random, and stopping when any one of them weighs
      within plus or minus 15 percent of any previously observed
      elephant.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Lisp machine hackers will see only elephants, and if they don't see any,
they won't go out,
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

      Economists don't hunt elephants, but they believe that if elephants
      are paid enough they will hunt themselves.

      Statisticians hunt the first animal they see N times and call it
      an elephant.

      Consultants don't hunt elephants, and many have never hunted
      anything at all, but they can be hired by the hour to advise
      those people who do.  Operations research consultants can also
      measure the correlation of hat size and bullet color to the
      efficiency of elephant-hunting strategies, if someone else will
      only identify the elephants.

      Politicians don't hunt elephants, but they will share the
      elephants you catch with the people who voted for them.

      Lawyers don't hunt elephants, but they do follow the herds around
      arguing about who owns the droppings.  Software lawyers will
      claim that they own an entire herd based on the look and feel of
      one dropping.

      Vice presidents of engineering, research, and development try
      hard to hunt elephants, but their staffs are designed to prevent
      it.  When the vice president does get to hunt elephants, the
      staff will try to ensure that all possible elephants are
      completely prehunted before the vice president sees them.  If the
      vice president does see a nonprehunted elephant, the staff will
      (1) compliment the vice president's keen eyesight and (2) enlarge
      itself to prevent any recurrence.

      Senior managers set broad elephant-hunting policy based on the
      assumption that elephants are just like field mice, but with
      deeper voices.

      Quality assurance inspectors ignore the elephants and look for
      mistakes the other hunters made when they were packing the jeep.

      Salespeople don't hunt elephants but spend their time selling
      elephants they haven't caught, for delivery two days before the
      season opens.  Software salespeople ship the first thing they
      catch and write up an invoice for an elephant.  Hardware
      salespeople catch rabbits, paint them gray, and sell them as
      desktop elephants.

      VALIDATION

      A validation survey was conducted about these rules.  Almost all
      the people surveyed about these rules were valid.  A few were
      invalid, but they expected to recover soon.  Based on the survey,
      a statistical confidence level was determined.  Ninety-five
      percent of the people surveyed have at least 67 percent
      confidence in statistics.

      ACKNOWLEDGMENT

      This study has benefited from the suggestions and observations of
      many people, all of whom would prefer not to be mentioned by
      name.

    20-Sep-89 00:46    Scott.Fahlman                Boolean cube???
    From: Scott.Fahlman@B.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

    The current issue of Carnegie Mellon Magazine mentions in two places,
    including the ad on the back cover, that the shape of the ugly laboratory
    buildings designed by Peter Eisenman for the new research center along the
    Mon is "based on the Boolean Cube, a model for computer design in
    artificial intelligence."  I've seen this description in several earlier
    articles about the building as well.  Apparently the shape in question is a
    tilted solid cube that appears to be pierced by a steel framework cube
    tilted at a different angle.

    Does anyone know what this "Boolean cube" concept is really supposed to be?
    I've been working in and around AI for the last twenty years or so, and
    I've never heard the term "Boolean cube".  The design allegedly was
    inspired by a quote of Dick Cyert's to the effect that machines have
    knowledge, but only people have wisdom.  I'm not sure if the part about
    wisdom was supposed to include "deconstructivist" architects and the people
    who select their designs.

    I've seen hypercube communication networks, but that's got little to do
    with AI, and these buildings don't look like they are projections of
    hypercubes into 3-space.  I've heard the term "Boolean algebra" on many
    occasions, and have even collaborated with Geoff Hinton, a real live
    descendant of George Boole.  I've seen Boolean truth tables that are
    usually square or cubical, but that's elementary logic or switching theory,
    not AI.  I've seen, and even written, AI programs that play with cubical
    blocks (among other shapes), but there is nothing Boolean about these
    blocks, and if one block pierces another it means your program has a bug
    and your robot arm is too damned strong.

    A cynic might suspect that this guy Eisenman heard a couple of buzz words,
    stuck them together, and used them to describe his building design, without
    ever making an effort to understand what these words meant.  A person
    inclined to conspiracy theories might suspect that this is the work of the
    same evil cabal that forced the Doomsday Cube logo on dear old CMU.
    Perhaps all these tilted squares carry some powerful subliminal message,
    known only to people trained in the black arts of Public Relations and
    Architecture.

    If they really wanted to use some motif from AI, there are several good
    ones.  They might cover the buildings with a network that looks either
    semantic or neural, depending on where you stand.  They might make the
    whole complex into an intractable search space, though that's been done
    many times before (e.g. in the design of Doherty Hall).  They might make
    the building in the shape of a big hill and let people climb on the
    outside.  (Be sure to include several false peaks and a tar pit or two.)
    They might build a huge gilded facade, and behind that put a couple of
    soaring towers rising out of a giant heap of bullshit.  Or they might build
    a big brain-shaped building, pierced through the higher cognitive centers
    by a tilted cubical framework.

Subj:   Guitar tips; secrets revealed!  Dr. Teeth!

Wonderful comment about Jimi Hedrix playing guitar with his teeth:

"But of course Hendrix had a very flat nose and a tremendous overbite, so
it wasn't all that difficult for him."

furtle

Want to know if it's a made-up word or real.

OED owners here report that it's not in their books.  Reason I asked is
that Workman is publishing a book next month called "The Naughty
Victorian Hand Book".  The cover sez:  "Furtling:  The Rediscovered Art
of Erotic Hand Manipulation".  I wanted to know if furtling really was
another blot on the Victorian escutcheon or if the whole thing was a
modern put-on.

Maybe it was a Victorian put-on.  Those folks had plenty sensayuma.  They
put pants on piano legs, didn't they?  This word was not in my dirty-word
dictionary, a review of which I'll do for you some day.

A final thought, dear Desperados, the world is full of standards and
converters these days.  I'd like to set up a little bureau of TECO hackers
and call it the Conversion Authority, and any time anybody wanted anything
converted from one thing to another we'd contract to do it for an enormous
price and run that sucker through TECO and convert it, no sweat, and
convert it back loss-less-ly, if that's what you wanted, and we'd charge
out the wazoo for it (and we'd never tell 'em it was free TECO behind it
all).
