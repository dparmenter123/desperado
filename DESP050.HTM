About the John Hancock weather light:

        I'm such a sucker for nostalgia.  I spent my formative years
living on the top floor of a house in Revere, and recall looking off
toward Baazden in the evening or at night to see what the weather was
expected to be.  (Usually it was a school night and I was hoping for the
snow signal.) So, on a recent trip into the city of my heart, the heart
swelled to see that after a ten or eleven year hiatus they've put the
light back on.  Of course, in that time I forgot what the signals were.
But the Boston Globe, its finger ever on the pulse of the city, tells me
that the light shows what weather is expected three hours hence. JH's
public relations people are offering this bit of verse to help you
remember how to decode the light:

                        Steady blue ... clear view
                        Flashing blue ... clouds due
                        Steady red ... rain ahead
                        Flashing red ... snow instead.

During the baseball season, a flashing red beacon will indicate that the
Red Sox have cancelled a home game.

I seem to recall that at least once in my childhood, they had a special
hurricane warning, but there's no mention of it in the article.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
ORPHAN::BODGE points out the fallacy of the undistributed middle,

        "Note, however, that the baseball season and the snow season
        have been known to overlap; no coding is given for that situation.
        Somehow, this arrangement strikes me as particularly and peculiarly
        Bostonian."

I love the lightning during New England snowstorms.  My mother once
saw ball lightning.  She was sitting on a screen porch and it rolled
in through the screen at one end of the porch and out the other
without doing any harm.  I was out on the beach once in the eye of a
hurricane.  It was very bright and the surface of the sea was in
turmoil, but there was only a light breeze.  I've also seen sheet
lightning, and a moonbow, and rainbows, of course.  Also, lunar and
solar eclipses.  My younger brother once saw The Glory, a full-circle
rainbow seen from a plane skimming the tops of the clouds when the sun
is at a low angle.  Both my brothers were in earthquakes in
California.  One of them was sleeping in a water bed when the quake
went off and woke up laughing as the bed tossed around. My wife was
trapped in a 50-inch snowstorm in Chicago and she and my children were
chased down a street in St. Louis by a tornado.  My father saw
Halley's comet.

In the words of the immortal Walt Kelly:

                Oh, roar a roar for Nora,
                Nora Alice in the night.
                For she has seen Aurora
                Borealis burning bright.

What unusual natural phenomena have the Desperados experienced?  St.
Elmo's fire makes its own beacon.

The proof of heaven being hotter than hell appears in a gem of a book
titled "A Random Walk in Science", a collection of stories and amusing
anecdotes relating to science and scientists. I highly recommend it, I
received a copy for Christmas 1981, so it was in print then (I forget the
author).

One of my favorite entries:
(I paraphrase except for the last line)

One morning, co-workers of the famous scientist were surprised to find
a horseshoe hung over the door of his lab. Knowing that the scientist was not
superstitious, they asked why he had placed a good luck charm over his
door.

His reply... "I understand that it works even if you don't believe in it."

Although I'm happy to see that biblical analysis bears it out, I already
knew that hell was not all that hot.  When I was a kid, my folks took me
to the dedication of a new convent where Archbishop Cardinal Cushing was
doing the honours.  He opened his remarks by saying, "It's cold as hell on
Cape Cod in March..."

The reason that its (possessive form of it) does not have an apostrophe is
to avoid confusion with it's (contraction of it is).  By including the
exception, the language is actually made LESS ambiguous to parse.

What's a "straw horse"?

I don't think it will help anyone to study secretarial science (whatever
that may be - the phrase is the creation of some administrative type in
charge of spiffing up the college catalog - my wife, who professes to teach
it, thinks it has something to do with typing, shorthand, all that sort of
thing); learning *why* there's no apostrophe in "its" is not the concern of
the dedicated secretarial scientist. It's enough to know which form to use.

                      PDP-11S ON THE MARCH!

PDP-11s may be obsolete to DIGITAL, but, according to this month's
OMNI, they're still being used at Case Western Reserve in projects to
provide mobility and freedom for quadriplegics.  Dr. Terry Hambrecht,
who runs the program, says he will eventually replace the PDP-11s with
microprocessors that allow the patients even more freedom...now they
have to be, as OMNI so cleverly put it, "tethered" to the computer.

However, attachment to their tether allows people who have no feeling
or control in any of their extremities and no hope of regaining that
feeling to grasp a paper cup and drink from it or to turn the pages of
a book.

The OMNI article describes the PDP-11's role in all this, according to
Dr. Hambrecht:

       "We discovered that the computer could do most of the
        bookkeeping. It could decide how much to stimulate which
        muscles and in what order, thereby coordinating the
        intricate pattern of muscular contraction that underlies
        even the simplest of movements.  The computer gives its
        directions, sending out a pulse that moves the muscles.
        Both the duration and the frequency of the pulse determine
        how much the muscle will contract."

About four years ago, in my "what does any of this have to do with
me?" infancy in the computer biz, I attended an Intro to RSX-11M
programming course in Bedford and met an actual live customer, from
Cleveland, who was working in a similar program at the VA Hospital,
connected with Case.  The operating system they were using (at that
time) to do all the data collection (bookkeeping, to Dr. Hambrecht)
was good old RSX-11M.  I had lunch with her every day and listening to
her stories, of almost immeasurable, but definite, progress.  At that
time they weren't at all sure how much they could do with their
research...in other words, how much freedom they would ever be able to
offer their totally immobile patients.

But talking to her did finally convince me that computers had
something to do with the real world and that I did want to be part of
that world.  (And I think I secretly have written every manual,
release note, memo, and mail message since then to help the
quadraplegics in Cleveland walk.)

Incidentally, a couple of months ago 60 Minutes did a story on how far
this technology has come:  a 22-year old woman who had been completely
paralyzed after a car accident was able to ride a bicycle around the
hospital grounds, using previously dead nerves, stimulated by a
microprocessor attached to a thin belt around her waist.  And it all
started with a bunch of PDP-11s running RSX-11M V3.1.

I had, this past weekend, the pleasurable company at a dinner party of two,
not one, computer paranoids.  One is a violinist who fears almost everything
about computers, and the other is the director of a pathology lab in Philadel-
phia who - resents (?) - the fact that computers are 'taking over' our lives.
The violinist's problem is, I surmise, largely one of lack of computer litera-
cy, but the other is a harder nut to crack.  Given that when he wants a pa-
tient's chart he wants it *now*, a down computer is a real hazard for him.  He
sees computers in more and more roles wherein they really *control* people, as
in his field and in banking, the military, management, etc., and he is truly
frightened.  We in the computer industry *must*, if we are to survive, find a
way to establish both widespread computer literacy (which, by the way, game-
playing will *not* do) and credibility ('Er-ror, er-ror, recompute' is the
world's view of us).  The average person in the USA today is deathly afraid
that his bank balance will suddenly change by orders of magnitude, and he
needs to be able to have confidence in the machines.  Recognizing that a
computer is only a tool is not enough - so is a hammer, and those things can
really *hurt* you...

From the Lowell Sun, February 16, 1983 (although, considering the contents of
this article, it may have been the Marrakech Sun...):

  CORAL GABLES, Fla. (UPI) - More than 8 percent of University of Miami stu-
dents surveyed by a geography professor couldn't find Miami on a world map.
  David Helgren, a professor at the suburban Miami university, polled 128
students.  He asked them to point out various spots, exotic and otherwise.
  "The numbers generated were pretty disgusting," Helgren said.  "Some of the
answers were worse than I thought ... 7 percent couldn't get the North
Atlantic Ocean."
  The disgusting numbers:  8.5 percent couldn't find Miami; 42 percent missed
Los Angeles,; 55 percent were unable to locate Chicago; and 42 percent
couldn't put a finger on London.
  "You can't imagine where some of the places were put," Helgren said.
"Capetown was put at the end of South America rather than in Africa.
  "The things that wandered most were New Guinea and Algeria ... New Guinea
was in Quebec and in Central America."
  Helgren saye he believes his results would be duplicted at most any college.
  "This is the sort of stuff we don't teach in the university," he said.  "This
is the sort of thing that one should learn (along) with the multiplication
tables."

These, gentlebeings, are the future politicians, mapmakers, travel agents,
etc. of the world.  Are you as scared by the prospects as I...?

Of course, Prof. Helgren has missed one point:  They don't teach the
multiplication tables in school, either.  They TRY to teach the kids how math
is supposed to work, assuming that any kid who knows how math works will be
bright enough (and motivated enough?) to make it work.

Prof. Helgren said that, in the case of Los Angeles, he was prepared to
accept any point on the US Pacific coast that was not San Francisco...
Even such startlingly lenient guidelines weren't enough!

I also endorse Cibachrome, including for home use if you have a color-ready
darkroom or are planning one. The material is indeed forgiving of temperature
and filtration errors, compared with most color printing processes. The
cost to make a Cibachrome print at home works out to about $2.00 per 8x10.
When you consider that you'll often make one or two test prints, $8.00
for a commercially printed 8x10 is quite reasonable.

Something to consider, whether you're having your slides printed commercially
or do it yourself: Cibachrome (and, to a slightly lesser degree, all other
positive-to-positive processes) is a very contrasty medium; so are all slide
films. Controlling contrast while you print is quite difficult with Cibachrome,
so it's best to make adjustments when exposing the film. If you know that
what you're taking will be printed (on Cibachrome or Kodak paper), I recom-
mend a slight increase in exposure over "normal"--perhaps an extra 1/3 to
2/3 stop (each 1/3 stop is one index mark on your camera's film speed dial,
GI). Two thirds of a stop is probably right, because many modern cameras
are built to "underexpose" by 1/3 stop or so; the rationale is that most
people are shooting slides for projection, and the slight underexposure
yields richer, more saturated colors when you blast the slide with a 500-watt
projector bulb.

Anyway, the overexposure will reduce the contrast of a slide film a bit,
making a more reasonable balance in the print. Otherwise, you may find
that things like deep blue, northern skies in your pictures will go almost
black when the slide is printed on Cibachrome.

I always use Cibachrome myself, because barring contrast problems, the
colors are quite accurate (vis-a-vis the slide!) and the dyes used in the
paper are more permanent than in conventional (e.g., Kodak) papers. The
higher cost of Cibachrome is due partly to the unusual construction of the
paper and partly to the more limited distribution of the paper compared with
the Yellow Box company's. It's worth it, though.

I hate to cavil, since the guy from Case Western liked the PC350,
but I do take exception to his statement that "the on-line tutorial
is moronic." Years ago, a fellow, more senior technical writer taught
me a little aphorism to describe this sort of phenomenon: "You write'em
books, and they just EAT the books."

There are two aspects of the computer-aided instruction (CAI) for the
PC300 that bothered me: a) some operations, which may have been dispensed
with altogether, take a fair amount of time, like the little movie of
a file folder creeping out of a file drawer; b) as with the EDT editor
CAI (in early versions I saw), there's no obvious way to "escape" from
the course and get back to the command language. Both courses were
designed by people who are professional educators and, within reason,
professional designers of computer-aided instruction. These are simply
the "defects of their virtues." Their courses are deliberately designed
to introduce the most basic principles (such as "what's a computer file
compared with a real file") and to not let you out of class without
a hall pass.

These properties are sure to irritate people who already know what the
courses are teaching. Whether they'll be counterproductive with their
INTENDED users is highly debatable. In any case, the courses are not
moronic. If they have had the experience, all writers and software
engineers know how difficult it is to make something "self-explanatory"
without offending some people who don't need the explanation.
