Subject: "ELEMENTARY BASIC, my dear Watson."

A book club I belong to is offering the following selection this month:

    ELEMENTARY BASIC
    Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes
    As Chronicled by John H. Watson
    Edited with commentaries by Henry Ledgard and Andrew Singer

      An entertaining step-by-step primer on how to program a home
      computer, using "new" Sherlock Holmes mysteries to demonstrate
      the various phases in programming procedure.

I imagine the stories go something like this:

  With the recent death of the Earl of ______, the world can finally be told of
  the case I call "The Sin( 4 )"; one of the most curious ever to come to the
  attention by my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the world's first consulting
  hacker.

  It began on a night in October 19__. Thick fog swirled about our windows at
  221B Baker Street. I was engrossed in the evening paper. Holmes was restless.
  It had been weeks since anyone had brought him a problem worthy of his
  talents.

  Holmes craved diversion, after a day of intense concentration working on his
  monograph "Why Leaves Change Color in the Autumn". He had spent the last hour
  playing Scarlatti on his Stradivarius and was just starting to play Pacman on
  his Atari, when Mrs. Hudson entered with a visitor.

  "Good evening," said Holmes, "Has the additional 16K of memory you have
  recently purchased for your TRS-80 improved the performance of Visicalc?"

  "Holmes, this is too much" I cried, "How can you possibly know ..."
                                .
                                .
                                .

Well, you get the idea. And if you get the idea, do you need to get the book?

Subject: Not quite like famous lies, but...

There are folks who think they must say things that are obviously false. A
little more obnoxious are folks who think they must say things that are
obviously true.  For instance...

        On the little heaters in the rest rooms here in TWO:
                CAUTION: HIGH TEMPERATURES

        In very small (hard to see) print about 1/2 inch away from the fairly
        big, (easy to see) cutting blade on Brand X Clear Plastic Food Wrap:
                CAUTION: CUTTING EDGE IS SHARP
        [Which is immediately followed by:]
                AVOID CONTACT

SO MUCH FOR TRUTHS... NOW A LIE:
--------------------------------

And, now through November 2 in Massachusetts, the most interesting famous
lie comes to us from the anti-Bottle-Bill posters, which say something like:

        Let's all work together to find a better solution to this problem.

To:   ALIEN::PARMENTER
Subject: texts

Here's one minor comment on the Japanese and their new textbooks.

Petitions were circulated thru DEC by our Oriental employees (mostly
Chinese) and were then sent to the Japanese Consulate in Boston.
The petitions specifically objected to the pro-Japan slant of these
textbooks, the suddenly elimination of blame from the Japanese govern-
ment of Japan's part as an aggressor in WW II, and the notion that
any action against the rioting Chinese public (as in Nanking) was
strictly a police action.  As far as I know, the organization has
received no offical acknowledgement from the Japanese government.
Similar petitions have been instigated in other countries and now
pressure has been brought to bear on these governments to make an
official statement to Japan, calling for the truth to be written down
for the Japanese children to learn from.

As my friend told me, when she came to me with the petition, she felt
it wasn't a case of trying to "blame Japan for the atrocities they
committed" as much as it was to educate their children to make
sure that it is understood that this was a genocide of the Chinese
people.  She wanted to make sure that the children did not grow up
thinking that what Japan did to the Chinese was an acceptable way
of dealing with a culture and a people.

Er..........   I am now getting off the soapbox......................

Subject: Getting the wrong TV Guide?

Desperados in Nashua who subscribe to TV Guide know that they
can't read about much of the cable stuff in the New Hampshire
edition.  They may not know that simply by calling TV Guide's
subscription service (800 345-8501) they can switch to the Boston
edition, which contains: Boston: 2, 4, 5, 7, 25, 38, 44, 56, 68,
New Bedford: 6, Worcester: 27, Providence: 10, 12, Manchester: 9,
New York: 9, 11,  Durham: 11, Cable: ARTS, ESPN, HBO, Cinemax,
MTV, Nickelodeon, Preview, Showtime, STAR, The Movie Channel, and
USA Network.  I don't know why they don't have WTBS.

Don't hold it against me, but I enjoy listening to several of the non-rock
stations listed. One that I recommend made the chart but was listed
incorrectly. It is WSSH 99.5 (FM), not WISH 99 as specified.
