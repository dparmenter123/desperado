You pondered if you could burn a steak with boiling water.

The answer is yes -- sort of.  You couldn't char it, but it could be brought
to a state one would consider to be overdone.

For your information, in a horrible accident a year ago, my wife accidentally
poured water that had been heated in a microwave for tea in her lap and
sustained considerable 3rd degree burns.  19% of her body tissue had been
burned off, resulting in a 3 week stay at the MGH Burn unit, several grafts
and 2 months of rehabilitation.

Water that is heated in a microwave can actually be heated to temperatures
higher than boiling.  This is called "super-boiling", and can be very
dangerous.

If the coffee had been heated in a microwave at McDonalds, it could have been
super-boiled and I could see that it would cause 3rd degree burns.  I won't
debate whose fault this is.  Just that it is possible.  I've witnessed it.
I hope you never have to.

                    A LOVELY NOTE FROM PETE KAISER

From: "Peter Kaiser" &lt;kaiser@vbo.dec.com&gt;
To: tompar@world.std.com
Subject: Remembering history and creating it

In 1967 when I left Princeton with 1A draft status ("about to be drafted")
and moved to New York to wait until I was emprisoned for refusing to enter
the army, I had very little money, just about enough to eat sparingly and
pay my half of the rent on the one-room apartment I was supposed to share
with my school friend Norman Fine.  (It was a remarkable summer, not least
because of Norman: he fell for the pretty young lifeguard at the country
club near his parents on Long Island, and didn't show up at all.  I've
never seen him since leaving the campus in June.  But he was a gentleman
about the rent.)

The draft board in Salt Lake City surprised the bejesus out of me -- and, I
suspect, my friends and family -- by granting my appeal to be considered a
conscientious objector and not be required to go into the army.  Instead,
after some maneuvering much aided by Captain Maher of the SSS office in
Manhattan, I was drafted to work for two years at the computer center of
Columbia University; and I did that, as staff and faculty.  But I still
hadn't much money, because as a conscientious objector assigned to the job,
I was a serf, and my pay was under half the going rate.  It was enough for
rent -- still shared, first with another school acquaintance and then with
my friend Norma in several different slum apartments -- and to eat, buy
used paperback books by the pound (yes!), subscribe to a few magazines, and
eventually buy the $100 bicycle I used until I left to work in Geneva in
1978.

But that was about it.  Soon after moving to Manhattan I was looking for
a charitable activity to fill out my busy schedule of work, political
activity, and dancing; and what I really wanted to find was something that
took no money -- something, indeed, for which money couldn't possibly be
substituted.  And I found two things.  One was Recording for the Blind, an
organization that uses volunteers to record schoolbooks and professional
books for blind students, mathematicians, lawyers, etc.; it's impossible to
hire qualified people to do this, so it must run on volunteer labor.  It
still exists.  I recommend it.  I used to read there one or two evenings a
week the entire time I lived in Manhattan.  (Mr. Shimshidian, the old
Armenian Jew who "guarded"  the lobby evenings, never ceased to give me a
hard time about my beard and the length of my hair.  But he was still
pleased when he spotted my picture in a newspaper: I was being clubbed by a
mounted policeman during a political demonstration, which gives you some
idea of how else I was spending my time.)

The second thing I lit on was to donate blood, which I also recommend.
(There's no substitute for blood yet, certainly not money.)  I had given
blood occasionally earlier, but now I simply decided to do it regularly as
often as possible, and in fact I have done just that since 1967, first in
Manhattan, then in Boston (I still have a little sports bag that Massachu-
setts General Hospital gave me after the fifth gallon) then Switzerland,
Boston again -- I take my blood with me wherever I go -- and now in France.
Regular as clockwork.

Until Sunday morning.

Last week a notice arrived from the regional blood donation center that the
van would be in Chbteauneuf this morning, and it was just on my schedule.
Sunday was gorgeous, the first beautiful day of summer somehow displaced to
come before the vernal equinox: warm, sweet, clear, and brilliantly sunny.
So after breakfast Luce and Ari and I took the grassy footpath up our
hillside to the village where the van parks, and there I entered and sat
down to have my history and blood pressure taken again by the same man as
always and then to bleed for five minutes before having the cup of coffee
and the cookie and walking back home filled with virtue and covered with a
bandaid.  Except that when he took my history this time and asked me
if I'd traveled outside Europe recently I said "only to the United States"
before remembering to say "oh yes, and to Johannesburg."  He pushed my
papers away from him and said "I'm sorry, then we can't accept your blood."
France considers visitors to South Africa at risk for malaria, so I'm going
to have to wait six months to give blood again in France.  Unless I return
to South Africa.  Maybe they'd let me give blood there.

I got to thinking about South Africa again.  Some people wanted to hear
about what I saw there.

If there's one thing I did see there, it's that people usually seemed to be
very civil to one another.  The blacks and whites I saw in Johannesburg
know very well that they have to rely on one another -- the whites still
have most of the wealth, education, and influence; but the blacks hold the
majority power.  They need each other, and everyone is very clear about it:
if someone staves a hole in the other one's end of the boat, the whole boat
sinks, not just that end.  Yes, most of the blacks I saw in Johannesburg
are obviously poor, obviously recent rural immigrants.  Yes, most of the
whites I met own houses and have black servants -- but their relations with
those servants have changed, they tell me.  And with some relief.

People pretty freely use terms like "the dark years".  The blacks I talked
to -- middle class -- were almost excessively courteous with The White
American about how they reached where they are now.  The whites talked
about the frustrations during those years of trying to live normal lives
and still try to change things by ordinary electoral politics.

The immigrant businesses, like my employer, are very civil workplaces,
and as a matter of policy are training non-white staff as quickly as they
can find them and afford to employ them.  It's a matter of survival.
Incidentally, a couple of things are very visible, and one is that my
employer has brought in non-South African blacks and put them into very
visible positions until they can staff the organization indigenously; for
instance, Digital's marketing manager in SA is a smart, hard-driving black
woman whom I had heard of within the company long before she went to South
Africa.  Another thing that's very evident is the feeling of relief at
finally having free and open contact with the rest of the world.  I asked
one colleague how he felt about having someone like me come in, basically
as a hired gun for something they might have been able to do themselves;
and he told me "I'm delighted".  He was sincere, and his reason was simply
that after all this time they need and relish the outside contacts.

The countryside is beautiful.  If I go back I'll try to take the time to
spend some days farther out, in wilder places.

The original version of this note was much longer; I mused my way well into
American politics and made the comparison with how things are in South
Africa.  But my friend Claudia told me that in this note I shouldn't mix
too much opinion with stuff that was mostly factual, so I haven't.  Maybe
I'll write the political note some other time.

I just heard (yesterday, I believe) on NPR that one idea

Channel 13 in NY - WNET, I believe) to sell their vhf

                    GROUCHO MEETS THE FOLK PROCESS

 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: dan@hq.lec.com (Dan Parmenter)
To: tompar@world.std.com

&gt;From: britain@emunix.emich.edu (Brit -- It's Grim Up North.)

&gt;Groucho reported the case of Mrs. Story (the 'I love my husband' lady)
&gt;in his book on the making of YBYL, "The Secret Word is Groucho."  I think,
&gt;though, that he may have used the account of one of his staffers.  Perhaps
&gt;the producers.  I forget.  But it did appear in the book, so if he denied
&gt;it to Leonard Maltin he contradicted himself.

This whole thread has been a fascinating example of "the folk
process".  Somehow or other Roger Ebert (in my original post) has
transformed into Leonard Maltin!  Other correspondents have also made
similar errors.  One person (can't recall who) had clearly only done a
"keyword search" on my post because their response repeated the "fake"
anecdote as real.  Amazing.

Basically we'll never know whether Groucho ever said it or not, and at
some level, it hardly matters.  If he *did* say it, it's a great
anecdote.  If he *didn't*, it's still a great anecdote.  As we all
know, perceived memories can easily take the place of real memories
(for example hypnotic regression "therapy") and once in place, can be
indistinguishable from "real" memories.  I guess this means that the
woman should have sued Groucho for sexual harassment.

                          THE HYPERTEXT HOAX

From: Dan Weinreb &lt;dlw@odi.com&gt;
To: tompar@world.std.com, gsmith@sybase.com, jo@odi.com
Subject: Hypertext etc

   And I must say as much as I enjoy all this computer, network, and disk
   stuff, it just doesn't hold a candle to sitting down and reading a
   book, allowing myself to settle into someone else's monologue and
   really listen for an extended period of time. Interactive is all fine
   and dandy, but nuance of argument often depends upon "having the stage"
   for an extended period of time. If someone is free to jump to another
   part of the "creation" at any time, the writer has lost control and can
   no longer conjure up subtle images and/or ideas. I'm sure there's a
   place for hypertext, but I'm just as sure there's a place for books.

I think the dichotomy between "hypertext" and "books" here is
exaggerated.  Books are not necessarily linear.  The most interesting
nonlinear elements in the books I read are footnotes.  Some books have
extensive footnotes.  "The End Of Equality" by Mickey Kaus (it's about
public policy regarding income equality versus civil equality, what to
do about welfare and the underclass, etc.) uses extended footnotes in
many places in a manner that I thought was very appropriate.

I agree with the gist of what Paul is saying; I just think the
conclusion is too harsh.  Probably the problem with existing
"hypertext" literature is that the authors feel compelled to put lots
of links all over the place, even when they're not appropriate.
Subtle ideas and images do require lengthy linear segments (at least
I've never seen them done effectively any other way).

   Linear storytelling has worked for 400,000 years.  No reason to
   think it has stopped working.

Well, it can have its drawbacks too.  There's a book review in the
latest Sunday NY Times of a big book about New York architecture and
city planning, 1960-1990.  The book has a chapter on each
neighboorhood, and the chapters each cover the whole period.  The
reviewer points out that this can be confusing, since what happened in
one area in 1985 might have been influenced profoundly by what happend
in another in 1965 (he cites an example).

Encyclopedias aren't linear either (look at how hard the Brittanica
people try to deal with this!).  On the other hand, individual
articles certainly contain essays that are long and linear, and need
to be linear in order to "have the stage" long enough to make their
point.  Perhaps encyclopedias, and works like the architecture book
above, are in a special category of "reference book", but the Kaus
example is not a reference book.

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 I used to drive my Dad nuts because I wouldn't start with the index
 when I wanted to find something in the encyclopedia.  I just grabbed
 the "right" volume and skimmed.  "I might miss something
 interesting," was my argument.  So I was even less linear.  But I
 think in the architectural history case, it was simply bad
 organization rather than being too linear.

 The essence of a story is that it all leads up to a conclusion and
 that we wait to see how it comes out.  If we get to choose how it
 comes out . . .

 This week's New Yorker had a cartoon:  "As soon as we have
 interactive fiction, I'm rushing Little Nell to a specialist."

 Some day, maybe when I get a scanner, I will "input" the telling of
 the story of Plato's cave as it appears in the 11th edition of the
 Encyclopedia Britannica.  Colossal Cave had nothing on Plato's.

&gt;From Desperado #14:

        It's not news until it appears in a newspaper.

Think of all the events that happen in the world.  Boy there's a ton
of them.  Most of them don't make it into the news media.  Let us call
those "order 0 events".  The stuff that makes it is called an "order 1
event".

Periodically, an event becomes such big news that the media reports on
the media.  This has happened in last year's celebrity knee whack and
the current trial of the century, to name a few events.  Let us call
these "order 2 events".

Now, for something to become an order 3 event, the news media would
have to report on the amount of reporting on the media surrounding an
event.  During the recent Super Bowl I saw a Tank MacNamara comic
about: all the media hype (order 1), the hype about the hype (order
2), and some Poor Fool hyping the hype-hype (order 3).  This made the
Super Bowl the first order 3 event I have been aware of, since clearly
it was referring to real order 2 reporting.  If the Poor Fool really
existed, then the Super Bowl was order 4.

Does this count as news?  Have I just increased the order by one?
Does this self-referece produce an infinite recursive increase in
order?

Who cares?

 Well . . . the other night i watched a drama about a catholic
 orphanage where the boys had been sexually abused by priests.  the
 abuse had been covered up by the church to protect a big government
 grant.  it appeared on the arts &amp; entertainment cable channel, which
 is owned by the hearst corporation and the abc network.  if it had
 appeared on the abc network there is every likelihood that some arm
 of the Hearst Corporation would have been abusing ABC for running
 it.  The drama wasn't news, it was just a drama, but if it had
 appeared on a network, even with the same number of viewers, it
 would have been considered to be public, that is, news, in a way
 that could never happen from cable.  That's what I meant.  The
 problem with the Superbowl is that even the first-order event is a
 fake, what Daniel Boorstin calls a pseudo-event, staged to attract
 attention.  That it gets attention shows that it was a success, but
 it doesn't make it news.  The big news stories, real news stories
 like Tanya and Orenthal, do take on a life of their own, but they
 somehow manage to stay within the boundaries of their reality.
 There's nothing that has happened in the OJ trial that I didn't see
 in the first murder trial I ever covered and I was the only reporter
 covering it:  accusations of police misconduct, multiple
 diversionary theories of non-guilt, community pressure in favor of
 the defendants, prosecutorial and police bumbling, defendants in
 dark blue suits.  The only difference is that there was no hourly
 box score.

I've noticed that we repeat words a lot these days.  I find myself doing
quite naturally.  The other day I said:

  "We're writing a book.  But it's not a "book book"."

I was at a Christine Comaford talk, where she was talking about stages
of projects:

  "Projects have three states: "Not Done", "Done", and "Done Done".
   Many programmers think that they are "Done Done" when they are really

Holly,
 Saw this on sci.med and thought you might find it amusing:

As the incidence and prevalence of Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) has
been increasing exponentially, a support group. The Internet Addiction
Support Group  (IASG) has been established.  Below are the official
criteria for the diagnosis of IAD and subscription information for the IASG.

         Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) - Diagnostic Criteria

A maladaptive pattern of Internet use, leading to clinically significant
impairment or distress as manifested by three (or more) of the following,
occurring at any time in the same 12-month period:

(I) tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

        (A) A need for markedly increased amounts of time
            on Internet to achieve satisfaction

        (B) markedly diminished effect with continued use
            of the same amount of time on Internet

(II) withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following

        (A) the characteristic withdrawal syndrome

                (1) Cessation of (or reduction) in Internet use
                     that has been heavy and prolonged.

                (2) Two (or more) of the following, developing within
                    several days to a month after Criterion 1:

                        (a) psychomotor agitation
                        (b) anxiety
                        (c) obsessive thinking about what is happening
                            on Internet
                        (d) fantasies or dreams about Internet
                        (e) voluntary or involuntary typing movements
                            of the fingers

                (3) The symptoms in Criterion B cause distress or
                    impairment in social, occupational or other important
                    other area of functioning

        (B) Use of Internet or a similar on-line service is engaged in
            to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms

(III) Internet is often accessed more often or for longer periods of time
      than was intended

(IV) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down
     or control Internet use

(V) A great deal of time is spent in activities related to Internet
    use (e.g., buying Internet books, trying out new WWW browsers,
    researching Internet vendors, organizing files of downloaded materials

(VI) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are
     given up or reduced because of Internet use.

(VII) Internet use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent
      or recurrent physical, social, occupational, or psychological
problem
      that is likely to been caused or exacerbated by Internet use (sleep
      deprivation, marital difficulties, lateness for early morning
      appointments, neglect of occupational duties, or  feelings of
      abandonment in significant others)
