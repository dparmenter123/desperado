I heard this story from the huffy employee below mentioned...

Ah, yes, well that sounds very flossy, to have an office which does
nothing but arrange movies for us, but one of the reasons why it was
arranged was because there was a bit of a brouhaha about what you
might term a missed opportunity with War Games. It was offered to DEC
when it first came on the tapis, as the French say, and it was turned
down rather huffily by one employee, and again, rather more huffily by
the same employee when it was offered again some months later. The
gist of the refusal was "We're not that kind of girl". Whether said
employee envisioned one of our/his beloved computers in a casting
couch situation is more than I can say. But if there's a choice
between getting a VT100 in a compromising position with a movie that
grossed your basic millions and one which sounds as much like box
office death as O.J. Simpson and a puppy in a truck, I for one would
rather see the VT100 with rather more module showing than was strictly
seemly.

Playing games at DEC.

        DEC selling computer games?  "Yeah, it is kind of a breakthrough for
us," said Gary Mikkola, whose title is marketing manager for Digital's
Classified Software.  Although adventure-type games have been nestled into VAX
machines for years, the Maynard computer builder is getting in the serious
game distribution business with Infocom, Inc. of Cambridge, whose "ZORK"
series has made it one of the hottest computer game companies.  DEC, which has
been stuffy about the business-only uses of its personal computers, is giving
Infocom games it seal of approval, calling them "executive friendly."  But the
lively game packaging, according to Infocom, must be altered to "come in line
with Digital's more standardized packaging concepts.

[Editorial comment]

        The possibilities for snappy retorts boggles the mind.  Suffice it to
note that this may explain the recent rash of anonymous "..remove any copies
of Dungeon from your system.." messages.

        It is also noted for the record that several software engineering
groups made *serious* proposals, when the PC product lines were first
announced, to produce game software in-house.  Let's face it, games sell at
*least* 50% (my guess) of ALL pc's sold.  Also, the profit margins are
*phenominal*, considering that post sales support is NILL! (it's a game
feature, YOU figure out how to avoid it!)

        So it goes.

*******************EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**********************
Hiya, GI! I know you've all been missing the Hit Parade and wondering
where we've been. You probably thought you had us on the run, didn't you?
Well, let me tell you, brother, we've been fighting a rearguard action
that can't be beat!

The main problem for us lately has been figuring out whether to war on
you ourselves or just let you commit seppuku! A few times, we even
spent some of our puissant soldiers when we didn't have to! Here's
what I mean:

When our fifth columnists started debriefing us about your DECUS convention
in Las Vegas, we were a little worried at first. You had oodles of those
nice Professional 350s, with software this time, and were making a little
headway with your users; they even started pestering MicroVAX people with
questions like "If I buy a hundred of those 350s, can I make them talk to
your robot here?" We were sure relieved when we were told that
Fast Eddie Kramer finished up the week by having a fire sale on all
the 350s that were on display! We were just about to order our saboteurs
back on the case, but you have your own people working on it! Thanks, Ed!

Meanwhile, we were starting to get pretty worried about your MicroVAX and
VAXelan in general. Even our happy programmers in Manchukuo would have
to get up pretty early in the morning to make better goods than those!
We had to try something that would mix it up for you guys a little.

First, we thought maybe we should give you a little trouble from our
comrades in the Pact of Steel, IBM. One of our agents tipped them off
that your MicroVAX I was going to be announced on October 18th. Were
they scared! Really, GI, you should feel flattered that they still
take you guys so seriously! In what was described in the plutocratic
Wall Street Journal as a "hastily arranged press conference" they
announced *two* little bazookas of their own, aimed right at you! They
kept their fingers crossed for a few minutes, worrying whether anyone
on the Journal would ask what REALLY was inside the "desktop 370," but
soon their fears were replaced with jubilation! On that very same day,
the President of your country announced that you'd made a little
boo-boo about war strategy: Your materiel people had decided to ship
only 20% of the guns that had been promised for the war effort!

The plutocrats, having no loyalty except to the almighty dollar, punished
the President by devaluing all his stock! And GI, the next day's journal
was all about IBM's machines and all about your financial wizardry! The
two articles appeared side-by-side! The MicroVAX news was one sentence
following several column-feet of DEC disaster: "In a separate announcement,
spokesmen announced the MicroVAX I, said to be the newest addition
to the company's line of 32-bit VAX machines." Let's face it, GI, the
MicroVAX just *wasn't the news* about DEC on October 19th!

Even so, boys, we didn't rest easy. We thought those cadres in Seattle might
still have some life in them. We tried sending them a balloon bomb, but it
missed and finished off the Tacoma Narrows bridge instead! Meanwhile, they
started getting back at us: They took their little MicroVAX/Elan system from
DECUS and made it even smarter! Now it could play minuets, solve the Towers of
Hanoi, and TALK (thanks to the efforts of your valiant troop, M. Minow). (And
GI, we heard a rumor that it was so easy even the guy that wrote the field
manuals could do it!) They turned up with all this, plus a neat new graphic
display, at the stockholder's meeting a week later! (Fast Eddie tried to keep
them outa there, so they wouldn't mix it up with his Professionals, but he'd
lost a little face, I guess, because they managed to sneak their stuff in
during the wee hours.)

The President arrived under armed guard the next day. "Go get'em, Ken," said
Major Schnorr. "Thanks!" said K0, "thanks a lot." Nobody had talked nice to him
lately. He got up on the podium and sounded calm and unperturbed. The
stockholders acted polite and thought that robot was the bee's nuts! The
troops put the robot back in his case and headed back to ski in the Cascades a
while.

Now we were worried again, GI. I mean, if our valiant Axis comrades can't spike
your guns, what could we do? I lost a little sleep over it and was too
depressed to make my broadcasts. Then, suddenly, I remembered that it's The
Enemy Within that gets you guys every time! Hadn't October 18th taught us
anything? From then on, it was Easy Street. You see, boys, our agents had
returned from DECUS with these beautiful, tasteful posters and technical
brochures about the VAXElan ammo, whipped together in their two weeks
by your brave comrades in Seattle. They were what scared us to begin
with GI! I mean, if they could do that in two weeks, what could they do in
a year? But when I took them out for another look, I noticed something fishy:
Down at the bottom, the posters said, "VAXElan is a registered trademark
of Digital Equipment Corporation." Well, I wasn't born yesterday, GI! I new
that in your country, ain' nobody has a "registered trademark" unless they've
really *sold* something; until then it's up for grabs! (What's more, your
man Joseph Heller appears to be in charge of this issue, since your country
won't *let* you sell anything until you have it ready to ship, and it's not
ready to ship until you have a trademark!)

Now I had it! I just picked up the phone and dialed Jelly Lester, in your Regal
Department. Impersonating Ed Kramer, I said, "I heard a rumor that four other
countries have trademarked the word ELAN." That was it, GI! Without stopping to
think that a) he'd already run a trademark search on "VAXElan" and come up with
zip or b) four countries couldn't possibly have rights to the same name, he
phoned up the Generalissimo in Seattle and said, "VAXelan is out; go get
another rock." "Drop dead," replied Polit-Commissar Brown, "or else get ready
to defend the suits. You didn't do your job, and it's too late." Forgetting
that he's working for the U.S. and not Albania, the honorable counsel replied,
"No hard feelings, but I've been ordered to avoid lawsuits at all costs." (Must
be those crass-action suits brought about by Black Tuesday, GI!) "How about
'VAX/elan,'" they pleaded. "That ain't it," he said, "go get another rock."
Then he hung up the phone, and while the DECwest cadres were searching their
rock collection, he dialed up Concord and stopped the presses on all the
*MicroVAX* promotional material, too! After all, it talks about VAXelan, and
that might provoke an attack by Upper Volta! The Seattle boys appealed to the
Secretary of the Interior, but he just said something about "optimizing the
microfocus across the DEC universe."

So there you have it, GI. We could lose the war if we fought you with our
weapons, but we can win if we use yours instead. And we WILL win, GI. We're
comfortable with DECwest playing "Go Get a Rock" and can now concentrate
on the one remaining threat, Micro/RSX. No trademark-jerk possibilities there,
but we can have our DECUS SIG double agents stand up and beg to have MCR and
no-name UIC's put back in! Don't underestimate us, Field Marshal Parmenter!
We know who you are!

One piece of sad news, boys: This is my last broadcast because, having just
about finished you guys off, I'm going to transfer stateside and see whether
I can spring Ezra Pound from the bughouse. If I can't do it, nobody can! See
you later, alligator!

Dungeon (Zork) and DND are two completely different games.  DND, the less
known, is quite similar to TSR Hobbies' original game.  It was this game that
the overproportioned legal fling involved.  As far as I know, no hot-shot
lawyers are telling us to get rid of our beloved Dungeon... yet.

It is not a rumor, but it does not have anything to do with the
game ZORK (DUNGEON).

It has to do with the 'Dungeons and Dragons'-like game called
(somewhat appropriately) DND. It has several dungeons and you move
rolled-up characters around and fight monsters, gain treasure, etc.
The problem is that DND is based on a game written externally. It
is owned by another company, and is known under a (trademarked) name
which happens to be the name of one of the dungeons in DND.

This is the game which has to removed. ZORK (DUNGEON) and ADVENT are
still okay.

I hope this clears it up (at least a little).

My offending remark:

    I'd say the chance of Dungeon (DND, Zork, whatever) disappearing
    entirely from all DEC machines is close to 0 (zero).  As I heard it,
    some pseudoconscientious dope (from Merrimack?) asked a company lawyer
    if it was legal and natch the lawyer said it wasn't and the dope
    started hassling everybody to get rid of their copies of the game.  A
    little judicious renaming of files and tasks should stop this madness.

The response follows.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: TS1::BURROWS "Jim Burrows"
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER
Subject: RE: DND Emergency

As the "pseudoconscientious dope", I might as well get my 2 cents in.
First, the program in question is not DUNGEON, ZORK or ADVENTURE. So
far as I know their is no problem with any of these. The program in
question is known as either DND or DEMO and is written in BASIC+,
BASIC+2, and PASCAL versions. The game board is pseudo-graphically
represented and is a 20x20x20 matrix.

Second, I strongly recommend against either following the course you
recommend ("judicious" renaming) or against commiting the kind of
opinions and advice you have expressed to either paper or iron oxide.
It is seldom wise to recommend or do things that are illegal,
unethical, unprofesional or dangerous to the interests of the company
for which you work, especially when the personal gains are relatively
small.

To set the record straight, the actual story is as follows. The reason
I spoke to the lawyer was that I heard from a couple of people that
someone was thinking of including the Pascal version on a distribution
kit as it was felt it might be a good demo of DEC's Pascal. What I
called the lawyer to find out was whether DND could be cleaned up
enough to allow it to be used that way. At first it appeared that it
might. However, after exploring its relationship to other company's
software and trademarks it became clear that not only couldn't it be
used commercially, but that the only way it could be detrmined whether
it was legal for DEC to have the game at all was through the courts.
It is quite possible that the result would be positive, but the
expense of finding out, and the risk involved in being wrong are
higher than is warranted for a game.

So I sent out a note to the people I knew had sources that DEC's legal
position regarding DND/DEMO must be as follows:

     1) The program(s) MUST NOT, under any circustance, BECOME a part
        of any of DEC or DECUS commercial offerings.

     2) In fact, ALL COPIES of BOTH VERSIONS of the program must BE
        DESTROYED. The game must be REMOVED from ALL DEC COMPUTERS.

     3) No further connections between DEC or DEC employees and Dan
        Lawrence's "dungeoning" game should exist.

I also pointed out that:

    I got the very strong impression that if Jerry had found out about DND
    from any source other than one of the people involved, he would be taking
    strong official actions to effect all of the above. Further, we can be
    sure that if after a reasonably short period of time, it comes to Jerry's
    (or anyone else in legal, or any of a number of upper management)
    attention that there are still copies of the game around, some significant
    official action will have to be taken.

This may sound like an over-reaction, but is in fact reasonable given
the legal siuation one puts the company in by keeping this software.
It could prove very expensive if the wrong people became concerned.

My note was sent to about a dozen people, and has apparently spread
like a chain-letter. I'm sorry to see that the identity of the game
in question has become confused in the process. I have been contacted
be several people asking about the status of other games or for some
of the reasons that DND is an especial problem. The response I have
sent them is in part as follows.

  "Now, as to other programs [than DND/DEMO]. Those that are direct copies of
  existing games, especially computer and arcade games, and/or ones that use
  the original games name, especially if it is a registered trade mark, are
  not really kosher. DEC certainly can't market them or make an commercial use
  of them such as including them free on kits, taking them to trade shows, or
  using them in demos. Internal use is sufficiently in keeping with current
  practice throughout the industry, that there probably isn't much danger of
  anyone actually getting burned. The legality and ethics of the situation are
  clearly poor at best.

  "Personally, after looking at this mess and the general games situation, I'm
  going to start being a lot more careful about the ethical, legal and
  profesional issues involved in game software than I have in the past, and I
  think I may have been more cautious to start with than many or most. I
  strongly recommend:

     1) not duplicating exactly any commercial game electronic or otherwise.
     2) not naming any game after the commercial game that inspired it,
        especially if that name is a trademark.
     3) not accepting any software to run on DEC-owned or DEC-manufactered
        iron with out the unconditional permission of someone who has the
        rights to it. (Either buy it on the open market or be given it by
        someone who realizes that he is putting it in the public domain.)
     4) being damn near as cautious about software for personally owned
        non-DEC-manufactured equipment.
     5) not giving any software that you are not absolutely certain is in
        the public domain to anyone outside the company directly. If they
        are customers, give it to their DEC salesman and let him give it
        to them. If they belong to DECUS, contribute it to DECUS. Remember,
        if you work for DEC or used DEC resources, DEC has at least an
        interest in it.
     6) Following rule 5 even for software you know to be in the public
        domain except under extreme duress. After all we do have to live
        with our friends.
     7) Not installing anything in a publicly accessible place on that you
        aren't 100% sure is in the public domain.

  "The reasons for these are three-fold. One, violating these rules is quite
  probably illegal. Two, stepping on some-one else's rights even when legal
  ain't ethical. Three, it isn't very professional either. As an engineer you
  owe and should in return expect a modicum (at least) of professional respect
  to/from your peers. It is our ability to be creative that makes us valuable
  in the job market. Similar respect is also due writers of fiction, game
  designers and other professionals. It is easy to fall into the trap of
  thinking that games or fantasy or science fiction aren't important, and thus
  are outside the realm of legal, ethical or professional consideration, but
  they aren't. People make their livings off of them just as legitimately as
  they do off of any other human endeavor."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
OK.  We can assume we now have the straight skinny.  When you put it
like that, it's not so dopey.

As for my "illegal, unethical, unprofesional or dangerous" advice
about renaming files to hide the evidence, I was speaking
realistically, which often looks bad in a court of law, but in fact
the current laws of copyright, et cetera, are already too feeble to
deal with copying audio and video cassettes and there's no way they
can be revised enough to cover the kind of situation we have here.
Say you send me a copy of "Soul of a New Machine" across the net in
.RNO format and I do a bunch of global substitutes, changing names,
reordering paragraphs, and generally munging it.  How long do you
think it would take for me to render it unrecognizable?  I could say
it was a *parody* of the book.

Or, say I did nothing, but just forwarded it to someone out in
ARPAland and another someone on another node, how long do you think it
would take to go around the world?  Twice?

And that's all text.  What if you send me a Pascal program and I do a
quick edit to put it in FORTRAN?  I change all the strings and all the
symbols that appear on the screen?  What happened to your program?

And what if I did all this with binary files?  What if I write a
program that outputs the text of "Soul of a New Machine" to a
terminal?  Can I/O be copyrighted?  Could Congress write a law that
software engineers couldn't get around?

I have a board game called Infinity.  It has beautiful graphics and
smooth, idiosyncratic play that combines luck and skill in some new
ways.  On analysis, Infinity turns out to be a gin rummy variant that
just happens to be played without cards.  Whose game is being used?
How many rummy games are there?

As for DEC putting unsupported software on kits, RSX used to give away
TECO (and Adventure and a few other things) until we answered an SPR
by saying the bug was caused by TECO and we didn't support it.  The
customer's lawyer wrote a letter to DEC and we fixed his bug right
away.  We also took all unsupported software off our kit and there it
remains.  VMS distributes stuff actually labelled as unsupported, but
if one of their customers has a problem, another lawyer may write
another letter.

And, who owns Desperado?

                 VMS system notes

Having written two different backup utilities in my career at DEC, I've
seen some pretty strange behavior from tapes and tape drives. But what
happened to me last night beats them all. This story is so bizarre I
couldn't possibly have made it up.

I was investigating a problem reported in a QAR, in which BACKUP
allegedly misbehaved when fed a tape save set in a certain way. So I
pulled a scratch tape out of my cabinet, hung it on STAR's TE16 and
wrote a suitable save set on it. I couldn't reproduce the problem on
STAR, so I packed myself off to TITAN, which was still running a
vanilla FT1 system.

TITAN's BACKUP refused to read the tape at all, complaining about something
having to do with the tape not being properly labeled. So, muttering
unkind words about the reliability of our tape drives, I tried the tape
on the other TU77. Same problem. Out of curiosity, I dumped the tape
to see what BACKUP was looking at.

Imagine my surprise when I saw a DOS file header label, followed by
the records of a microfiche index. What I was dumping from the tape was
the stuff that was on it from the last time I used the tape, some two
years ago. So where was the save set I just wrote?? Back to STAR I go,
to check the tape again and see whose tape I accidentally overwrote.

I mount the tape on the TE16 again, mount it, and BACKUP assures me
that the tape indeed contains what I thought I just wrote on it.
I happen to notice that STAR thinks the tape is recorded at 800 BPI.

Once more across the machine room to TITAN, hang the tape on the TU77,
and dump it again, and yes indeed, the microfiche index is still there.
TITAN thinks the tape is recorded at 1600 BPI.

Light begins to dawn over Marblehead. I am vaguely aware that there have
existed BOT skew problems between different types of tape drives
(i.e., different drives start reading and writing the tape at different
points relative to the physical BOT marker). But each of the pieces
of data I'm seeing is of significant length - the backup save set is
a good three feet long, and the fiche stuff goes on a long way. So
the two streams of data are definitely occupying the same stretch
of oxide.

However, the ID burst, which is located at BOT to identify a 1600 BPI
tape, is small. So the TU77 sees the the ID burst, and the TE16
doesn't. I vaguely recall that the fiche stuff was indeed written
with a TU77. The amazing piece of it is that the two recording
techniques are sufficiently orthogonal that they can coexist on the tape.

This is the honest to God truth. I have the tape in my office. I'm
considering donating it to the Computer Museum, but I'm not sure they
would appreciate it properly.
