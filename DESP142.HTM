Well, hey -- it's been a while. Let me say only that if I could figure out a
way to have February surgically removed from the year, I could retire on the
obscene profits. Fortunately, with a combination of drugs, phototherapy and
steamed littleneck clams in garlic sauce, I have won through to March, and
may I say what a pleasure it is!

My first and most important question is to ask you if there are any funny
stories about February that the rest of us would feel better knowing. Share
the misery, kids, and one more thing -- next year in Martinique, ok?

Subj:   10,000 Chinese Communists on the net

This just in from HUMAN-NETS...

                    Exchange Students Spying?
        Trade Expert Warns They Could Crack DoD Computers
                    -California Computer News
                 -January 1986, Volume IV, No 1

By Lona White - CCN Contributing Writer

      LOS  ANGELES  -  Approximately  11,000  Communist   Chinese
foregin  exchange  students  enrolled  in  the  most technically-
orientated U.S.  universities may possibly have cracked the  top-
secret Defense Department computers.
     According  to  Dr.  Miles  Costick,  Washington,  D.C.-based
private  trade  expert,  many  of  these  alleged "students" hold
high-level  degrees  and  have  acquired  considerable  practical
experence in advanced science.
     "Obviously the majority are students and experts  and  to  a
lesser degree graduate and post-graduate students," he said.
     They are studying at such heavyweight  institutions  as  Los
Alamos,  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology (MIT), Cal
Tech,  Stanford,  Lawrence  Livermore  and  the   University   of
California, Berkley.
     At the California Institute of Technology, they are studying
composite   materials,   which  are  compounds  for  making  heat
resistant nuclear missile nose cones.
     At  MIT  they  are  involved  in  physics,  propulsion   and
navigation  studies,  but  computer technology, especially hybrid
technology, appears to be the primary goal.   These  hybrids  are
the product of digital and analog computers and are most suitable
for military intelligence operations.
     They are also  interested  in  microelectronics,  production
technology  for  advanced microchips, nuclear weapons technology,
advanced fiber optics,  astronomics,  areonautics,  and  advanced
telecommunications  systems,  including  satellites and satellite
ground stations.
     "The Chinese students have free access to everything,"  said
Costick,  "even  at  our nuclear weapons defense facilities where
lasers and particle beam weapons research is  conducted  for  the
President's  Strategic  Defense  Initative (SDI).  Our own people
are required to have top security clearance in these  areas,"  he
said.
     At Los Alamos or California's Lawrence Livermore  they  have
access  to terminals where much of the U.S. military intelligence
research work is done.  "For a good mathematician it  takes  less
then 15 minutes to break into the codes," Costick said.
     This open-arms policy exists for the sake of  good  Chinese-
Americans   relations.    By  contrast,  however,  the  under-400
American students studying in the People's Republic of China  are
denied  any activities that remotely approach the freedom allowed
visiting Chinese here.
     They are  restricted  to  one  particular  area  or  to  the
university  and  can  be  arrested  or expelled if they are found
driving in forbidden areas.  The secret police even prevent  them
from mingling with Chinese students at the schools.

wine report from Stanford University. PLEASE use Desperado responsibly,

Subj:   Strange places, these bastions of higher learning

From _Imprint_, the UW student paper, through Canadian University Press:

The University of Saskatchewan Student's Union no longer has a president.

A motion to change the title of the office from "President" to
"The Big Enchilada" was passed at USSU's 1985 General Meeting in November.

U of S Engineering student Mike Jackman said he put forward the motion to
remove some of the mystique from the person bearing the intimidating title
of "President."

"We now have a very accessible individual whom students... will be able to
come and talk to because he has a bonehead name," Jackman said after the
meeting.

Student council president (now Big Enchilada) Ian Wagner was not amused.

"I've always considered myself to e a pretty approachable guy," the Big
Enchilada said.  "How much more approachable do you want to get?"

Student Council Arts representative Veronica Dutchek said she urged people
to defeat the motion because few people in Saskatoon take students seriously
and calling the student council president "The Big Enchilada" would only make
matters worse.

Mike Fisher, Canadian Federation of Students Saskatchewan executive rep, said
he disagreed with Dutchek.

"I think I'm in favour of this," Fisher said.  "Anything that can fill up this
room for the most boring meeting of the year, I have to vote for.  Let
democracy be served."

Subject: "Mind rape" by computer mail

In the October 1985 issue of 'Ms.' magazine, there's a lengthy article
entitled "The Strange Case of the Electronic Lover" by Lindsay Van Gelder.
It tells how a prominent New York psychiatrist in his early fifties
maintained an on-line identity over CompuServe for more than two years as a
disabled, late-twenties, female neuropsychologist, developing intimate
friendships with scores of electronic correspondents.

"She" had a detailed contrived life history, announced her marriage during the
course of the fraud, sent gifts to people, and was heavily into (bisexual)
compusex.

As you might imagine, many of "her" victims felt enormously betrayed, likening
the experience to "mind rape".  The article has quite a bit to say about the
nature of electronic correspondence in general.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
If I were a gentleman, I'd be dashed uncomfortable with the name of the
author of this one. The article is posted outside somebody's office here
in ZK, and I must say, it's entertaining. I continue innocent of the net,
and from the stories I hear, I'm just as pleased.

According to a news item in the Nashua Telegraph's Video Showcase TV
supplement, Frank Zappa has recorded a new album.

It's titled "Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention" and gets a big
boost from his friends at the Parents' Resource Music Center (PRMC), Tipper
Gore's anti-rock committee -- the x-rated dance track called "Porn Wars"
inlcudes the recorded voices of senators John Danforth, Albert Gore, Fritz
Hollings, and others from the now-famous Senate hearings. The album also
features a monologue by the Rev. Jeff Ling, who reads some of the rock
lyrics he would like to see censored, and of course Ms. Gore herself.

The album bears a sticker warning of its use of "explicit language."

As a Christmas gift, Zappa sent a copy of the record to every member of
Congress.

Bleu Cheese
-----------

Here in Europe we are fortunate enough to have more than one type of cheese to
choose from.  Hence "blue cheese" is in no way a "baby puppy".  In fact, it's
quite unspecific, there being many different types of blue cheese:  Danish
Blue, Roquefort, Stilton, are examples of the genre.

As for "bleu cheese", either someone can't spell, or they are trying to
impart an "ambience francaise" - hard to achieve in the Mill cafeteria.  Can
we now look forward to "Pate de boeuf en pain grille"?

                            By TERRIL JONES
                        Associated Press Writer
   TOKYO (AP) - A young Japanese couple stroll down chic Omote
Sando Boulevard, their matching jackets bearing the words: ``Fancy
Pimple.'' On the platform at Shinjuku station, a young man in a
punk hairdo sports a coat with bold, stylized lettering:
``ANTHRAX.''
   Like most other Japanese who wear English slogans on shirts,
jackets, hats, even underwear, they said they didn't know what the
words meant.
   ``Japanese Ingurisshu'' (English), as the form is widely called,
adorns not just clothing but pencil cases, shopping bags,
stationery and many other items - and much of it is incorrect,
absurd or unintentionally obscene.
   ``Absolutely weird,'' is how Kim Schuefftan, an editor with
Kodansha International, a publisher of English-language books on
Japan, describes it. Schuefftan is compiling examples of ``Japanese
Ingurisshu'' in advertising and fashion.
   ``Japanese copywriters very conscientiously and adroitly use
English as Japanese,'' he said in an interview. ``The words have no
meaning, but connote something, like `Oh My Dining.' '' That, he
said, was a slogan used by Seibu department stores to promote
personalized tableware.
   The English word ``my,'' in fact, is widely used to convey a
sense of intimacy between owner and object, such as ``my home'' and
``my car.'' Tokyo Gas Co. went a step further with the slogan, ``My
Life, My Gas.''
   ``Let's'' and ``Do'' are also favorites, especially in
connection with action. ``Do Sports'' is a popular athletic club,
and many foreigners recall the enigmatic T-shirt: ``Let's Sports
Violent All Day Long.'' Instructions for Mercotin tablets once
read: ``Adults: 1 tablet 3 times a day until passing away.''
   Among the scores of tiny clothing shops in Tokyo's trendy
Harajuku area is Zen Mall, where customers can choose designs such
as ``Just Fit to You. King Kong,'' or ``Do not disturb please.
SCRAP!''
   ``It doesn't matter what's written on them. It's not English,
it's art, and if the colors and shapes are nice, it will sell,''
said Takashi Murakami, Zen Mall's manager. ``Nobody ever asks us
what they mean. We don't even know ourselves!''
   Some food names may sound attractive to Japanese but revolting
to a native speaker of English, such as ``Creap'' coffee creamer
and ``Calpis'' fermented milk drink. Supermarkets sell candy named
``Bourbon Pickle,'' ``Chocolate Sand Cookies,'' ``Glico Pocky'' and
``Choco Pretch.''
   Resident foreigners regularly note down and swap slogans,
especially four-letter words and other obscenities that constantly
turn up on T-shirts and shopping bags. Embarrassing double
entendres sometimes go undetected, said Schuefftan, who has lived
here for 22 years.
   ``The visual layout is important, not the message,'' says Yoji
Izawa, chief designer of GC. Inc., a paper products maker. One of
his creations shows a female pig bathing, with the caption:
``Heathery and precious. Scent of a monologue. A formal imitation.
Slightly mellowing tonite. A ball.''
   Izawa also was responsible for a letterhead design of a
policeman arresting a masked hippopotamus, with a single,
four-letter word in quotes. When one retailer returned a shipment
because an American customer complained that it was obscene, the
word was altered to read: ``Shoot!''
   ``You can interpret it two ways: in fun or by being insulted,''
Izawa said. ``Unfortunately I didn't realize it then.''

Subj:   For DESPERADO

    The third building at the Spit Brook Road facility in Nashua, NH
    has been approved and construction may begin this summer.  Bill
    Heffner, Site Host Manager, has asked me to submit a list of suggestions
    for conference room names for the new building.

    How did I get stuck with this?  I was "foolish" enough to organize a
    similar effort when ZK2 was being built, as I objected to the proposed
    list of room names which mostly honored computer hardware pioneers -
    this seemed strange for Digital's Software Engineering Facility.
    With the help of a few fellow engineers, I drew up an initial list
    of software pioneers, and asked people to either vote for our
    suggestions or add their own.  These ballots were distributed far
    and wide, and I eventually received several hundred replies.  I
    sorted and collated the list and presented the results to Bill.
    The result was that most of the ZK2 conference room names were taken
    from the top vote-getters.

    Well, at DEC, there's the philosophy that "once you touch it, it's
    yours", so Bill approached me with the request to do this again
    for ZK3.  This time I have learned from my past mistakes and will
    use our technology more wisely.   After mulling over various
    possibilities, I settled on a VAX NOTES conference as the means
    of collecting ideas.

    I have created the conference TLE::ZK3 for this purpose.  Note 1.1
    in that conference gives the "rules" for making suggestions.  I
    will gather suggestions for a month and will then make some sort
    of ballot available - form of which is yet to be decided.  (Suggestions
    on how to do this can be MAILed to me at TLE::LIONEL - please do
    NOT mail me room name suggestions!)

    To access this conference, you must have VAX NOTES installed.  VAX
    NOTES is the real, Digital-supported product which is currently
    in field test, and is installed on hundreds of nodes on Digital's
    Easynet network.  You cannot use the old VNOTES, NOTES-11 or other
    utilities.  If you have VAX NOTES installed, use the following commands
    to add the ZK3 conference to your VAX NOTES "notebook":
        $ NOTES
        ADD ENTRY TLE::ZK3
    To read the conference, use the NOTES command OPEN ZK3.  An
    introduction to VAX NOTES can be found in the file
    TLE::SYS$HELP:VAXNOTES.MEM.

    If you want to participate in this "event", and absolutely cannot
    get access to VAX NOTES, send me mail at TLE::LIONEL and I'll see
    what I can do for you.  Suggestions are welcome from any Digital
    employee at any facility.

    Bill has expressed the desire to continue with our current theme
    of computer pioneers - hardware and software - and I welcome additional
    suggestions along that line.  However, suggestions for other themes
    are also welcome.  We need at least thirty rooms named, and I'd like
    to come up with at least 40 related suggestions.
