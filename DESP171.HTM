What a great audience, no really, I mean it. You took me up on every
point, several of them to excess. My collection of personal names
alone was worth the trip. Here, try a few:

"dreaming of the ur-mouse"
"Remember the year we had the locusts? I voted for them, too."
"I'm a lawyer, you're a reptile. Call it professional courtesy."
"Insufficient virtual ...um...er..."
"Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?"

And while you're thinking about personal names to lay on me, try
some error messages:

        Our interest in VMS error messages was born one day as
        Dave and I drove home from an MRO3 lunch, and got hooked
        by the idea of an AI product for the home:  VAX Babysitter.
        We were making things up at a furious pace.  Dave chimed
        up with

        ...and many others.  I actually had to stop the car and

From:   BISHOP::STICK
To:     KRYPTN::MCGOWAN

Chile recipe #1 was a success, I served it two nights in a row to
friends. No real hotheads in the crowd, I served it kinda  wimpy but
everyone liked it. You'd think I could find some hardcore metalmouths
around here! Anyway, it was a gas, but not too much since I soaked the
beans as recommended.

Subj:   The Great Chile Cook-off

I wasn't planning on getting involved in the great chile debate; that's one
game you'll never win.  But after trying some of the recipes from the recent
issues of Desperado, I felt it was my civic duty to enlighten those less
fortunate than I.

I won't attempt to give an exact recipe for my chile; I never measure the
ingredients.  I just toss 'em til it tastes right.  But here's an attempt:

  1.5 lbs chuck cut into .5" cubes
  1 lb ground pork
  1 lb chorico or linguico (hot Portuguese sausage) cut into .5" slices
  3 or 4 onions
  3 cloves garlic
  A handful of chile powder
  Cumin seed
  Oregano
  Salt
  Cayenne Pepper
  4 fresh tomatoes or 2 cans tomato sauce
  15 jalapenos
  pinto beans (optional)

I'm not going to debate the relative merits of beans in chile; if you like 'em,
use 'em.  But use fresh ones.  The night before you plan to make the chile, pour
the bean in a large bowl, cover them with cold water, then add 1 tsp oil,
1 clove minced garlic, and a few chopped jalapenos.  Leave it to soak overnight,
and they'll be ready for use in the morning.

On to the meat of the matter:  you may call me a heretic (or lunatic for that
matter) for putting the hot sausage in chile, but trust me.  Sear it quickly
over a high flame.  Drain and set aside.  Then do the pork, drain and set aside.
Then sear the chuck chunks and drain.  Then throw 'em all into a dutch oven.

In a food processor, throw in 2 onions, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 tomatoes, and
most of the peppers.  Whiz it into a red-green pulp and add it to the meat.
Chop the remaining tomatoes, onions and peppers into little chunks and add to
meat.  Rinse the beans, retaining the peppers and garlic you added.  Throw that
into the meat.  Add the spices til it tastes right.  Bring to a boil, reduce
to a simmer, and cover.  Cook for at least 4 hours, stirring occassionally, and
adding water as necessary.  (But not too much - I like my chile thick.)  After
the chile's been cooked, to adjust the consistency, put 3 Tbsp of flour in a
cup, add enough warm water to turn it into a thick, flowable paste.  Add to the
chile and simmer another hour.

Remember:  the longer chile cooks, the better.  And it's great reheated!

Serve with cheese, nacho chips, and lotsa Dos Equis.

Subj:   Well, at least I wasn't subjected to another round of abuse...

It must have been a Desperado previous to your reissue that contained my
original "Chili Flatulanzio" recipe.  God, what a lot of flak!  I think I'd
rather subject my political or religious views to public scrutiny than my
chili recipe.  Why, self-styled chili aficionados are almost as arrogant
as self-styled expert skiiers.  Maybe that's why you always find chili at
ski areas...

Got a pot curing in the refrigerator right now -- best on the third reheating

On to chili:   Jeff Smith did eat his heart out last Saturday on Channel
2 (30-Apr).   He cooked about 5 different kinds of chili, one of which
bore a resemblance to the recipe I adopted.

Well, I blushed when I read your remembrance of me in #1157A - blushed and

I'm writing about Chili. Real Chili, that makes you cough and sweat and
wish you had a Teflon Asshole Transplant.

Anyone who wants some Real Chili should show up at the Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs on Saturday afternoon, June 4th, for the 8th Annual
Chili Cookoff. Go to the booth with the big sewer snake, and you've found
the Pikes Peak Roto-Rooter Chili Team: Steve "Intense!" Sicola, captain;
Leslie Hale; Joe Krantz; and myself.

We've entered for seven years - haven't won once, or even come close, probably
because we make a Green Chile in a Red Chili contest. But we're not in it
to win; we're in it to blow the judges' tonsils out, and make the hottest
brew that the public health laws allow. Last year one of the judges rated
our stuff "so hot its unreal" - and this from a jaded professional, mind you.
This year we'll throw in some Habanera chiles from the Yucatan for a little
extra heat.

Tastes are normally available for a $.25 donation to the Training Center, but
if you flash a picture of the Desperado Kitten we'll give you a hit gratis.

Abuse Your Innards while they can still take it! Come on down!

Subj:   question on contributors to Desperado #1157

In the second contribution on Digital culture, the mail appears to be
from ENOADM::GARDNER but you refer to the author as ENOADM::CHAPMAN.
I was curious as to who this is, but couldn't find either name in ELF
with ENOADM as a node.  If you manage to sort out the mystery, perhaps
you could report it in the next issue.

Incidentally, you didn't get promoted to vice president because your
name isn't Dick.  Half of the recently-promoted bunch have that name.
Take whatever action you deem appropriate!  (Of course, if you want
SENIOR vice president, you should focus on 'Jack'.)

Subj:   Mistake in Desperado

Hi Therry,

RE: Desperado #1157

In your comments regarding the letter from CELICA::SUSSMAN (Harris
Sussman) on DEC culture and the reply from ENOADM::GARDNER, you referred
to ENOADM::CHAPMAN instead of ENOADM::GARDNER as the reply contributor.  I
believe that ENOADM::GARDNER is Lawrence Gardner at the Enfield CT site.
I have a procedure I use to locate the site of network nodes and it says
that ENOADM:: is in Enfield CT.  Using ELF, I see that there is a person
by the name of Lawrence Gardner at the ENO site, although no E-mail
address is given.  I did not verify that ENOADM::GARDNER is in fact
Lawrence Gardner, but a mail message to ENOADM::GARDNER would certainly
settle the question of what the contributor's name is.  I any event, it
wasn't ENOADM::CHAPMAN.  I don't no whether ENOADM::GARDNER subscribes to
Desperado, but I felt it was necessary to let you know about the mistake
in the hope that you will make amends in the next issue.

Not everyone is perfect, like me,

                                        help the cause, but this is my

Subj:   someone said you collect trip reports

Ah, so they called you about that, did they?  Well, the truth is I was
in the building, I just got misdirected.  I showed up at the Pentagon at
9:45 for the 10:00 presentation where I was supposed to fill in for you.
There was a large line at the door and things were rather chaotic.  The
people in line were the rudest bunch of people I had ever seen,
constantly pushing and shoving, and many of them didn't smell so good.
They would have conversations where three or four of them would start
talking at once, and rather than stopping each would just raise the
level of their voice. I counted at least five who were already drunk at
that hour of the morning. When I got to the front of the line, a woman
in uniform asked, "Are you here for the conference?" and when I said,
"Yes" she pointed me toward a door.

It was just straight-up ten o'clock when I went inside and large, armed
men closed the doors behind me.  I started to get out my slides when a
man up on the raised stage cleared his throat.  He looked like an Air
Force general.  At least he had the blue uniform with lots of decorative
braid and ribbons from shoulder to ankle.  The effect was a little too
garish to see if there were stars on his shoulders or not.  At any rate,
I figured he was going to open the meeting, and would call me up to the
stage later, so I just sat down and listened:

        "Ladies and gentleman, as you are aware things have been unstable
        in the Middle East for some time, and the signs are that there
        will be an upswing in terrorist activities during the coming
        months.  We have reason to believe that the recent airliner
        hijacking is just the first in a number of events planned to keep
        the summer `hot.' Although we have no reason to suspect that acts
        are planned against our citizens directly, there is a
        good chance that in any action Americans may become involved, and
        the world community will look to our nation to see how we handle
        ourselves in the crisis.

        "We are in some respects fortunate that this is the last term for
        our current commander-in-chief.  He cannot run for office again,
        and he is sufficiently old that he will not be seeking employment
        in the private sector.  You might say he has nothing to lose.

        "So we are prepared this summer to strike back for any action
        taken against our citizens, anywhere in the world at a moment's
        notice.

Now, I have to admit, that at this point I was a little unsure how he
was going to swing the topic over to DECforms.  But I figured maybe they
had an application where if there was a terrorist act, some embassy
official would fill in a DECform at his terminal and report it to this
alarming individual for proper action.  Think of it! They'd have to buy
licenses for each embassy, as well as the Pentagon.  Then there'd be the
leveraged sale of AT LEAST microvaxes for each installation.  I was
trying to decide how to best fit my presentation into this introduction,
(and rather wishing they had told us this was how they were going to
lead in) so I missed the introduction of the next individual on stage.
He was a rather menacing fellow wearing the camouflage fatigues that are
so popular in dance clubs, with his face was made up to match.

        "Ladies and g'men," he said, "My name is Lew'ten Cun'l Raight.

        upcoming summah."

It took me a minute to catch on that he was speaking English.  By then I
realized that these people were not here to listen to a presentation on
DECforms.  The crowd of rude, rank-smelling, alcoholic mutants that I
was in was The Press.  I was in the wrong meeting.  I considered
slinking out, but there were still armed men keeping the back
doors closed.  I decided to sit it out.  You won't believe what I
heard.

(I'll transcribe the rest in English.)

        "Too many times in the past, the United States has been perceived
        to be operating in a position of weakness when responding to
        terrorist acts or dealing with a hostage situation.  The
        president has determined that response in kind to a terrorist act
        is essentially playing on their ballfield.  What we need to do is
        act from our areas of national strength. For this reason we are
        implementing a policy of controlled cinematic response.

        "In controlled cinematic response, we react to terrorism with our
        greatest national strength: we use the movies as a response to
        hostile acts against our citizens.  Cinematic response has been
        tested in the field and found to have satisfying results.

        "You ladies and gentlemen no doubt recall the hijacking of the TWA
        jet in Beirut.  In a test of cinematic response, we quickly
        released "The Delta Force" a movie in which the great patriot
        Chuck Norris defeated the terrorists, saved the hostages and made
        the terrorists themselves look like silly people.

        "That movie made back its production costs five times over.  The
        message here is plain and clear:  mess with us, and we will make
        the world think you're funny-looking, and we'll make a bunch of
        money off you.  We aren't looking for trouble, but if you start
        something, we'll make movies at you.

        "At this moment screenwriters are standing by.  Both Chuck Norris
        and Sylvester Stallone are on option.  Key action and chase
        scenes have already been filmed.  Tactical humor teams have
        written scores of jokes that can be modified at a moment's notice
        from `a Priest, a Rabbi a Minister' to `a Priest, a Rabbi and an
        Imam.'  Risibility Engineers at Lockheed and General Dynamics are
        even now working on the self-targeting `Sergeant York Joke' which
        automatically puts down any group whose avowed purpose is
        contrary to the United States'.

        "Pre-emptive movies are in the can awaiting Summer release.  In
        one, Chuck Norris plays a member of the US Summer Olympic
        kick-boxing team who destroys a group of mercenaries, dressed in
        rayon leisure suits with loud-print shirts, who have come to
        disrupt the Olympics.

        "In another, Rambo learns that a group of MIA's from the Viet Nam
        war are being moved to Beirut by supertanker, and he arranges to
        intercept them at the Kargh Island oil depot in the Persian
        Gulf.

        "In both movies, the Americans kick ass and take names.  They are
        block-buster material ladies and gentlemen, and they will
        completely overshadow in the public mind any impotent gestures
        that our diplomats may make in reality.

While the Lt. Colonel opened the floor for questions, I took the
opportunity to sidle up to the General and explain how DECforms and
VAXstations tied together by microwave link could speed their film
distribution operations.  Sorry I missed the meeting that you were
supposed to be at, but I think we've got a sale on this one.

Let's see if we can get some field reps to go visit the drive-in
movie theatres, there may be some side-action we can pick up
there.  Hope your cold is better.
                                        Regards,
                                          Amyl

I can believe that product managers are cowed by your rattlesnake earrings.
But then product managers and so forth participate in what Mr. Bush has
popularized as "wimp factor."

What I want to know is, do they do any good in meetings with Graphics Services?

Mr. Desperado/Neilsen:

Please send me those chili recipes.  We're looking for a
few good bowls (of chile).

So naturally I let him know as tactfully as possible that it was
not Mr. Neilsen (AKA Marcus Aurelius) that he was talking to, and
pointed out the reference to the earrings.

Ms. Desperado/Hoodoo,

sorry about the mistaken gender; men can wear earrings also.

Subj:   Identifying Digital (or is that DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION?)

I agree completely with that anonymous, nameless bureaucrat from Europe,
who is concerned about presenting Digital's proper image to the outside
world.  It would certainly help with problems like this:

A manager in the company where my wife works called up one of his
colleagues, recommending an applicant for a writing position, with these
words:  "He's worked at Digital, and also at DEC!"
