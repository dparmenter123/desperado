I didn't watch this last night, but everyone who did was knocked out.
Try to catch it.

Subject: This week's NOVA

I don't know if you saw Nova last night (Tues), but it was absolutely
incredible. It was about human reproduction, and featured one sequence
after another in which I found myself saying, "How in the world could
they ever have taken that picture?"  For instance, the end of a
woman's Fallopian tube curling around and actually stroking the
surface of her ovary to be sure it captured the ovum that was just
about to be released.  Microphotographs of sperm swimming upstream
against the motion of the cilia that line the Fallopian tube.
Scanning electron micrographs of a sperm entering an ovum, shedding
its tail, and literally exploding its chomosomes out into the interior
of the egg.  Movies of an ejaculation from inside the urethra.  And a
strangely touching sequence in which an 18-week old fetus kept
covering up the camera light with its hand-- it obviously didn't like
the bright light.  All in all, nothing short of phenomenal.  (My only
complaint concerns the narrative, which was rather stilted at times.)

Nova is on again tonight (Wed) at 10 pm on channel 44 (with open
captions, though), and again on Saturday at 2 (with closed captions).
Some scenes, such as a childbirth with all of the usual mess, might be
a little strong for small children.

This awe-inspiring program exploded forever the myth that the male is
just a drone who fertilizes an egg and then goes off somewhere while
the female of the species (in this case, our own) does the really
important work.  The show was the first I've ever seen that focused
attention on the male reproductive system, in particular the sperm.
Men all over the world should be holding their heads high (and, as the
program taught us, their testicles low) this morning.
