In response to your query:  on DSSDEV my prompt is,

"Yes, M'lady?"

I sure do like those subservient computers!

However, on CYBELE (my new GPX, named after a mother
goddess of ancient Asia Minor, and therefore rather more

"Speak!"

Naming your own node can be quite a chore.  I spent a

                PUSS COMES TO SHOVE

                        ( -- The Economist, June 27 1987, p. 52)

        Pluralism has come to Hungary.  True, it is not exactly political
        pluralism, but it is a small revolution for the Hungarian cat world.
        A split has developed in the Association of Hungarian Cat-Lovers
        and Cat-Breeders, amid accusations that the organisation is trying
        to wipe out thousands of pedigree cats for the sake of bigger
        profits.  Several members have resigned and set up a rival club.

        In the centre of the row is an old aristocat:  the Siamese
        variety of cat, with its pointed ears and triangular face, whose
        origins can be traced back to Thailand.  The development in
        recent years of Siamese with sleeker bodies and longer noses has
        reduced the commercial appeal of the more traditional sort.  The
        Hungarian association, which derives much of its revenue from the
        breeding and exporting of pedigree pussies, decided to switch its
        attention to the more lucrative cats of the future.  Declaring
        that Siamese cats must be "brought up to modern standards", it
        ordered the castration of the traditional Siamese males.

        Some outraged members claimed that this amounted to "genocide", and
        promptly stormed out in protest.  The two sides have since been
        exchanging insults over Hungary's state-controlled airwaves with
        the verve of rival politicians.  The defectors are branded as
        conservatives standing in the way of progress.  They retort that
        the association is failing in its duty to defend the right of all
        cats to live, irrespective of race, creed, or colour.  Their
        compassionate appeals have found many supporters in a nation of
        cat-lovers.  After all, in 1983 Budapest became the first capital
        city after London to state Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Cats",
        which has been playing to packed audiences ever since.

Regarding the recent trip to Venice ("streets flooded, please advise").

In a previous incarnation, I worked in Washington, D.C. and was a
member of that amorphous blob called the bureaucracy that people
like to blame for everything from nuclear war to the Jim and Tammy
Bakker debacle.  (By the way, Tammy is not suffering from drug and
alcohol problems; it's just lead poisoning from her makeup.)  Anyway,
Jimmy Carter was president at the time and he, too, went to Venice.
The diplomatic corps received instructions from Washington to form
a motorcade.  "I can't," the chief of station cabled Washington.
"There are no streets in Venice."  "Don't be a smartass," came the
reply.  "Just do it."  Once again the hapless chief of station
tried to tell Washington that Venice is built on canals, and the
celebration would be a gondola-cade, not a motorcade.  And once
again the hapless chief of station got chewed out by Washington:
"DON'T TELL ME WHAT VENICE IS LIKE!  I WAS THERE DURING THE WAR!
GET THAT MOTORCADE ORGANIZED!"

       And the Fish Comes Out So Clean You Can See Your
       Own Reflection

       Clare Ansberry, staff reporter
       Wall Street Journal  p.15
       Friday, July 3, 1987

       While millions of Americans will grill burgers
       and hot dogs tomorrow, Donald Seamans will be
       cooking salmon in the dishwasher.

       "A dishwasher is a perfect place to cook a
       salmon," explains Mr. Seamans of Marblehead,
       Mass.  For that matter, it's also good for
       cooking potatoes and green peas, he says.

       Fishing for a Solution

       When Mr. Seamans and his wife, Beverly, decided
       to invite some friends to a traditional New
       England Fourth of July dinner several years ago,
       he didn't have a steamer big enough for a whole
       salmon.  He didn't want to cut the salmon into
       little pieces because the Seamans also like to
       decorate the fish and display it on the table
       before dinner.

       Enter the dishwasher, a seemingly practical
       solution.  Mr. Seamans could lay the entire salmon
       -- 18 to 20 inches long -- on the top rack, turn
       the dishwasher on for one cycle and -- if the
       fish wasn't done -- put it back for a second
       rinse.  Potatoes, he found, took about the same
       amount of time.  The peas did nicely with just a
       few minutes of the second rinse.

       There are some finer points to the process.  The
       fish cavity is stuffed with fresh dill and doused
       with white wine and lemon juice before being
       wrapped in cheesecloth and placed on a dish
       towel.

       "If you just put the fish in by itself, the water
       would beat it to death," he says.  "It would be
       an awful mess -- little pieces of fish all over
       the bottom of the dishwasher."  Friends have
       suggested pouring vermouth into the soap
       dispenser, but Mr. Seamans demurs.  "It's a waste
       of good vermouth," he says.

       Culinary Concerns

       L. Edwin Brown, executive director of the
       American Culinary Federation, doesn't think many
       professional chefs will soon offer Catch of the
       Day a la Dishwasher.  For one thing, industrial
       dishwashers would make mincemeat of fish.  "Chefs
       prefer microwaves," he says.

       Mr. Seamans is undaunted.  "You could do a
       clambake, too," he says.  "but I haven't quite
       figured that out."

        I listened with great amusement to an interview
        with Bobby Seale on NPR this morning.  He was pushing
        his as-yet-unpublished book, "Barbecuing with Bobby,"
        which he was frank enough to admit was "a way to generate
        some income" from a generation that has become "yuppified"
        to the point where "they've all got a barbecue in the
        backyard."  In fairness to him, however, the techniques
        he described sounded quite delicious.

        But it does make you wonder about a country in which a
        third-rate actor becomes president and a Black Panther
        becomes a barbecue king...

The following appeared in the Wednesday (24-Jun) New York Times, in the
Metropolitan Diary, a weekly column of "human interest" stories sent in
by readers:

        A small sign was taped to a building on West 120th Street near
        Amsterdam Avenue, and Ellen Shaw of Scotch Plains, N.J., noticed
        it as she passed by.  It was a discreet advertisement for a
        nearby stand run by three young entrepreneurs - two boys and a
        girl - who were selling iced tea, cola and cookies.

        Ms. Shaw ordered tea and offered the youngsters a suggestion:
        "You may want to make a bigger sign," she said.  "That one is
        really not too noticeable."

        "I know," said one of the boys, gesturing toward one of his
        partners, "but that's as big as his computer makes them."

        He paused, thought for a moment, and slapped his forehead.  "Hey,
        I've got it!" he exclaimed.  "Maybe we could DRAW a bigger sign!"

        The tea, incidentally, was herbal.

To whom or whatever edits Desperado...

I am head of the Digital Network team in Western Canada.  A year ago I
started writing a newsletter called NETwest, which is sent to Sales
and Advisory people in Western Canada and to various people in GIA.

As a regular feature of NETwest, I've been including a section called
"News from the H.A.I.R.net", which I've been told is good for a grin
or two.  Having been copied on issue 1149 of "Desperado", I thought
you might be interested in seeing a few H.A.I.R.net entries.  Do with
it what you will.

NEWS FROM THE HAIRnet

HAIRnet stands for Heuristic Access Information Retrieval Network, and
is the internal designation for a communications system used for our
internal engineering organization to aid in advanced development
projects.  Typically these projects are 9 to 12 months from customer
announcement, so although I have a HAIRnet account and will be posting
some of the information I get in this newsletter, such information
should be treated as highly confidential, internal use only.

Interestingly, HAIRnet access is controlled using an undocumented DCL
command QUERY TERMINAL/NO_NECKWARE which ensures that HAIRnet access
is denied to marketing types or anyone wearing a tie.

The April edition of NETwest will be dedicated to HAIRnet articles
which I think are pertinent to the Networking marketplace.  Just to
give you a taste of the kind of thing we'll be seeing, I've included a
short article on some developments within network design.

SUBJECT:
Ethernet Phase IV

In recent articles we've seen how Ethernet has advanced from thick
coaxial cable to thin, RG58 cabling, and how the next generation of
Ethernet (Etherplumb) will be implemented over existing plumbing,
using the protocol recently developed at the Culligan Institute of
Technology, CSPA/FD (Carrier Sense with Porcelain Access and Flush
Detection).  However in Advanced Development, we recognise that the
network market is changing rapidly, and that we will need to
continually evolve our product set if we're to stay ahead of the
competition.  In this light, we have seen that the notion of
" The Network is the System " is becoming passe', and that what our
customers are demanding is a further evolution of this strategy,

" THE NETWORK IS THE CAFETERIA ".

That's right, Ethernet phase IV will be the Digital's first network
strategy to incorporate SNADS (Snack distribution services) as a
layered functionality.  This will allow our customers to increase
productivity and reduce personnel overhead by eliminating the need for
coffee breaks (recent articles in the popular press emphasize this
need).

Our first products incorporate a buy-out of GE's popular SpaceMaker
microwave ovens, which we'll announce as the MUNCH-IE (Multi-user
Network Control Host - Information/Edible).  This device will be
located in every office cubicle, and provide network and snack access
to all users.

The product set has been tested with all major third party software
(NABOB, NESCAFE) and hardware (Tim Horton, Country Style).

COMPETITION:  Both the other major players in the network business are
known to have competitive offerings under development.  Little is
known about AT&amp;Ts PDS (Potable Distribution System), but it is known
that IBM has had difficulties with it's Token-Onion-Ring based product
suite: The System 88 variant can't serve anything other than espresso,
and early field test sites of the System 38's CDAM (Coffee &amp; Danish
Access Method) have reported that the hardware is a choke point.
Further, the operating system for the 9370 DOS/JF (Doughnut Operating
System/Jelly Filled) is unable to cope with more than 64 user
requests/second without getting potato chip crumbs in the DASD cooling
vents.

As you can see, HAIRnet access should keep us in Western Canada up to
date and with it in the future product arena.  Stay tuned for the
April 1 edition of NETwest, which will be dedicated to HAIRnet
articles, and will include news of new productivity tools for sales
reps.

I received the following from somewhere a few years ago.  No idea who wrote
it.
------------

                ZEN AND THE ART OF SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION

        (Translated from the P'u-t'ung hua dialect by W.C.Carlson)

Editor's Note: The following are excerpts from the only known treatise on
Zen Software Documentation.  Called "H'ring-chu-tsu", which literally
translates to "Ink of Several Insignificant Matters", this treatise was
written in 12th century Japan by the scholarly monk E'm-ie-T'i.  That it
discusses Software documentation - predating the advent of software by
some 850 years - is but another of the mysteries of those who walk the
true path.

On Preparing to Write of Software

To prepare for the writing of Software, the writer must first become one
with it, sometimes two.  Software is untasteable, opalescent, transparent;
the user sees not the software, so the writer must see through it.  Spend
long, quiet mornings in meditation. Do not sharpen the mind, but rather
blunt it by doing Zen crosswords.  (Ed. note:  Zen crosswords are done by
consulting only the "Down" clues; and always in the mind, never on paper.)

The mind should be rooted but flexible, as a long stemmed flower faces the
sun yet bends with the wind. Think not of compound adjectives because they
tend to wire the mind in two directions.  Rather, consider the snowflake,
which radiates in beauty in any and all directions. Partake of strong
drink.

Do not study the Software; let it study you.  Allow the Software admission
to your mind, but keep it in the cheap seats.  Let it flow around you at
its own pace. Do not disturb or dismay it, but keep it from your private
parts because it tends to coalesce there.

When the Software is with you, you will know it. It will lead your mind
where it should be, and prepare you for the narcolepsy that is certain to
follow. You will know when the Software is with you, and so will others.
You will smile with an inner smile. Typewriters will frighten you. You
will fall down a lot.

On Writing of Software

The first exercise in writing Software documentation is the Haiku. Haiku
are 17 syllable poem forms in which many ideas of a single concept are
reduced - nay, distilled - into a short, impressionistic poem.  For
example, the Haiku for preparing to write of Software goes:

                        Emptiness on paper;
                           Fleeting thoughts.
                        Red Sox play at Fenway's
                           Green Park.

Write Haiku describing the particular Software that will eventually grace
your manual.  By concentrating on the Software's form and function in a
concise, subliminal, truly meaningless Haiku verse, you have transcended
the Software, and you can then write the true manual.

The following Haiku is from a Zen manual on data transmission:

                        How swiftly whirls the disk;
                         Data leaps to the floating head
                          And is known.

And this on the art of hardware maintenance:

                        The smell of hot P.C. card,

On the Review Cycle

This is the murkiest path.  Storms gather and disperse around you in many
directions, none of which are in English.  The path becomes unclear as
many ideas compete for attention. Some of them are fatal.

But the writer of Zen Software documentation fears not the turbulence of
review cycles. Let it storm around you and be dry, warm, and safe in the
knowledge that you have written the pure manual. Anyway, you know the
printer. You shall in the end have it your way.

        sat beside him, saying, "Master, I am confused by my existence.
        The tigers and horses go about their lives as if they know what they
        are doing, and why; but these things I do not know."

        The Master reached up and took the straw hat from T'a Xien's head,
        took a large bite from it, and cast it into a nearby swamp. With a
        laugh, the Master said, "That is the meaning of life."

                        Dead Languages for Living Drones

       According to the New York Times Book Review, in 1794 a newpaper
    in New England ran the following advertisement for one of its columnists:

       "Salutory and Valedictory Orations, Syllogistic and Forensic
    Disputations and Dialogues among the living and dead -- Theses and
    Masters' questions, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic and the
    ancient Coptic, neatly modified into Dialogues, Orations &amp; c. on the
    shortest notice...Dead Languages for Living Drones...Anagrams,
    Acrostics, Anacreontics; Chronograms, Epigrams, Hudibrastics &amp;
    Panegyrics; Rebuses, Charades, Puns and Conundrums, by the gross or
    single dozen...Adventures, Paragraphs, Letters from Correspondents,
    Country Seats for Rural Members of Congress, provided for editors of
    newspaper -- with Accidental Deaths, Bloody Murders, Premature News,
    Tempests, Thunder and Lightning, and Hailstones of all dimensions,
    adapted to the season...Serious Cautions against Whoredom, Drunkeness
    &amp; c. and other coarse Wrapping Paper; gratis to those who buy the
    smallest article."

       Surely, the readers of the 1987 [San Francisco] Chronicle should
    expect no less.  Presenting, for your amusement, everything promised

Subj:   PHC correction

In the latest Desperado was a funny piece on Lake Woebegon.  That piece
made a reference to NPR, as did your editorial comment afterward.

It is apparently widely assumed that because Prairie Home Companion (or
"PHC" to the cognescenti) is heard over public radio stations, that it is a
product of National Public Radio.  It is not.

PHC was developed by Minnesota Public Radio in the mid/late seventies.
After a few years on the air just within the state, MPR offered the program
to NPR for national distribution.   NPR turned them down.  Said it was "too
midwest" for a national audience.  (Tells you something about what the
Washington-based NPR people think is important.)

So MPR formed their own distribution company, American Public Radio.  At
the beginning of PHC you can hear the APR audio-logo, based on the opening
bars of something or other by Bach.  APR does not own a satellite, so they
rent space on NPR's satellite.  This means that any public radio station
with an NPR receiver can also pick up APR programs. (The satellite carries
12 independent audio channels.)

APR has a wide range of programs available, including quite a few
interesting folk programs, and the call-in program on investing.

When a public radio station carries Prairie Home Companion, the money goes
to American Public Radio, not NPR.  NPR deserves none of the credit for
this.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
And I feel a perfect twit because in the midst of all the NPR scandal about
mismanagement, I felt quite smug about the fact that my favorite radio
show, as it then was, had nothing to do with those scoundrels in Washington.

Subj:   NPR &lt;&gt; APR

  Trivial correction:  "A Prairie Home Companion" (APHC) is produced by
  Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and distributed by American Public Radio
  (APR), not by National Public Radio (NPR).  I've heard a vicious rumor to
  the effect that APR was created for no other reason but to distribute APHC
  after NPR refused to carry it.

  So what, do you suppose, will MPR/APR do for an encore?  And don't tell me
  about Noah Adams' new show, the one he left NPR's "All Things Considered"
  (ATC) to do for MPR.  After choking down Susan Stamberg's "Weekend
  Edition" (WE) for a few months, I don't hold out much hope for Yet Another
  Variety Show (YAVS) hosted by an alumnus of ATC.

        Could anyone give me some insight on the pro's and con's of
    aluminum vs steel in a good road frame? I'm particularly interested
    in the Vitus and Trek 2000 frames. Any experience with those? I'm
    looking for something in the 60 cm size and I have heard that the
    Vitus can be mushy in the larger sizes. Is that true? Am I better
    off sticking with a good chro-moly(sp?) frame. Most of my riding
    is medium distance (20 - 30 miles) on rolling terrain. Thanks.

According to an article in Saturday's Boston Globe, Joey Crugnale
has purchased 114-year old Bailey's ice cream stores.  He plans to
take it national.

History:  about 10 years ago, the original Steve's Ice Cream was in
Davis Square, and Joey had a similar operation about 1/2 mile away
in Teele Square (both in Somerville).  Eventually, Steve sold out
to Joey, who opened many branch locations, eventually selling out
for big bucks to some national organization that makes all their
ice cream in New Jersey.  Steve subsequently got back in business
as Herrels, and Toscaninni's (Central Sq. in Cambridge) still has
the best ice cream.

For you out-of-towner's, Bailey's sells good quality ice cream in
lovely old-fashioned mahogany and marble shops.  They also make
chocolates (and a wonderful hot fudge sundae).
