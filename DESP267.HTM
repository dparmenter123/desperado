Tom,

I keep having these strange conversations with people about how politics
has turned language and understanOAding upside down -- to wit:

Radical means seeking fundamental change at the roots (radix).
Conservative means seeking to preserve values.

So what are "Radical Conservatives?"

Likewise, the liberals are continually accused of having a "radical agenda."
So why are they being accused of becoming more conservative?
Maybe they are conservative, since they are preserving values like pluralism.

So is "Liberal Conservative" a term with meaning?

The same seems to go with "Right" and "Left."

If the Right has a radical agenda (see this months Harper's magazine for a
discussion by six Republican strategists, "A revolution or business as
usual?," where they grapple with their self-described radicalism) and the
Left is "moving to the center" (which I think means acting to conserve
policies and values) where does this leave me?

Desparate?

This is as puzzling as the discovery that many of the people who
disbelieve in evolution are Social Darwinists.

Lastly, I got a late-night phone call from a friend who had just
discovered a new oxymoron in a printer's catalog:  "dull glossy paper."

When I have 365 oxymora, I'm going to publish a desk calendar.  So far,
"tight slacks" is my favorite.

 I'll get to the political meat of this in a moment, but what about
 "variables" versus "volatile variables" and "constant variables"?
 Semantically, "constant variable" reads like "required option" and
 "volatile variable" reads like "optional option".  I believe that
 our language is flexible enough to handle all of these.  In the case
 of "variable", the word proved not capable of handling the entire
 load of the concept and thus had to be extended beyond the
 definition "that which may vary" to include "that which is made and
 used like a variable, but which does does not in fact vary" and
 "that which is made and used like a variable, but is gonna vary more
 than you may be used to from your variables".

 Since you ask, "radical conservatives" are reactionaries and not
 conservative at all.  "Liberal conservative" certainly has a meaning
 dating back at least to Adlai Stevenson, meaning "aid the poor
 because its the right thing to do and keeps them from rebelling".

 As for where politics is going, the right leg has definitely moved
 and moved in ways that are not just business as usual, but the left
 leg hasn't moved yet.  There's still not all that much difference
 between the parties except that one is mean and the other is stupid,
 so stupid hasn't really reacted and mean has atari.  Unless you're
 prepared to argue that everything was jammy-jammy and nothing should
 change, then it's hard to get too excited that the Republicans have
 been given a two-year run by 19 percent of the electorate.  Things
 have needed shaking up for some time.  There's more to come and more
 to be heard from.

 That's not to say that the Balanced Budget Amendment isn't a hoax,
 more salary-cap phoney baloney.  Until the federal government has
 separate capital and operating budgets this entire "debate" is
 vacant of reason and is only vindicated by the utter impossibility
 of smuggling this thing past three-quarters of the states (all of
 which separate capital spending from operations in their budgets).

Consider the case of Groucho Marx.  Everyone has heard about how on
"You Bet Your Life", a woman appeared who had 89 children (or 7 or
whatever, the number isn't important).  Groucho asks how this is
possible, she replies "I love my husband" and Groucho replies "I love
my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth sometimes".  Yuck yuck.  Cecil
Adams reports this as the gospel truth.  Groucho denied that it ever
happened.  It's a good line, so it's hard to imagine that Groucho
would deny it if it were true, but he insisted that it wasn't (this
&gt;from an interview with Roger Ebert).

The moral of the story?  I have no idea.  Maybe all hilarious
anecdotes should be reported as truth and enjoyed as jokes.

 BTW, a simple contradiction, particularly a merely verbal one, is
 not an oxymoron.

 The best PC documentation is on the boxes.  These generally tell you
 what the software is for, who uses it, and what you'll see on the
 screens.  Only the last point is covered in the documentation inside
 the box, but only in black &amp; white, while the box screens are in color.

 I saw an ad for TGIFriday's on TV the other day.  The music was "It's
 Your Birthday" by the Beatles (thanks to copyright holder Michael
 Jackson) and the occasion was some corporate anniversary.  I've
 pretty much resigned myself to hearing favorite songs in ads.  My
 son Dan says it's all part of the folk process of distributing songs.
 Anyway, it was definitely a respectful version of the song and not
 without a surprising amount of edge for a commercial, so all in all
 I was having a good experience with the song.  Then, at the end, on
 screen flashed the words, "The original is still the best".  I
 assume this was a TGIFriday motto, but oh, the sweetness of superior
 consciousness.
