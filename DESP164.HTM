Subj:   Desperado reader contribution offer text

Heaven knows no one at Digital would be guilty of the crimes described in this
letter to "Science" from some issues ago:

                                Noun Use Criticism

        The use of a series of nouns to modify another noun is common in the
        writing of biologists.  Adjectival nouns save on prepositions but make
        articles stuffy and stilted.  Two such nouns may read smoothly enough
        ("heart chamber pressure," "jaw muscle tone") but can be strained
        ("stomach contents results").  What about three?  Do we really want to
        read "heart chamber pressure change," "sea snake diet data," "hair cell
        orientation pattern," and "ankle joint angle measurement" (to quote
        recent examples)?  One graduate student, having learned by example how
        zoology is written up, submitted a thesis with a section on "lizard
        ovary winter lipid level change."  I call for research article writer
        reform and a professional journal editor policy shift to discourage this
        adjective noun use tendency in order to reduce the science literature
        jargon glut.

Here are some choice high-tech jawbreaker terms, culled in the
course of considerable work in engineering:

1. Asperity-enhanced Fowler-Nordheim tunneling
2. Incomplete-Choleski conjugate-gradient decomposition
3. Steel-backed Babbitt journal bearings
4. Impact-ionization avalanche transit-time diodes
5. Differential proton-precession magnetometer
6. Almost anything from coding theory (e.g., Bose-Chadhauri-Hoecqinghem
      or cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon codes)

Directions for use:

Repeat each expression ten times, or until you can say it naturally.
Then apply liberally if you feel you are in danger of being
understood, just as some people do in technology, not to mention
business.

Also, these expressions are invaluable as a rhetorical trump card,
to salvage a situation that might otherwise be embarassing:

   "OK, if you're so smart, tell me how these library book
   detectors work."

   "Asperity-enhanced Fowler-Nordheim tunneling."

Subj:   Kids Say the Darnedest Things

Howdy, strangers!  I'm not working at DEC anymore, and I don't read
 Desperado anymore either, but I came across something that should
  interest Desperados of a literary bent.

Matt Groening, the cartoonist whose weekly "Life in Hell" strip (the one
 with the doodle-like rabbits) shows up in various alternative newsweekly
  papers across the country (and has been anthologized in three books:
   _Love_is_Hell_, _Work_is_Hell_, and _School_is_Hell_) has started on a
    new project.

He went dumpster diving behind some Los Angeles high schools and has half
 a garage full of kids' high school notebooks, book reports, essays, love
  letters, tests, etc.  He's not quite sure what he's going to do with
   them, but he'll think of something.  In an interview in _Honk!_ magazine
    (Issue #3, March 1987), he describes some of it.

        . . . One of my favorite ones is the kid who had to write an
        essay on "The Person I'd Most Like to Meet in History" and the
        kid wrote "The person I would like to meet in History is this
        girl.  She sits in row C . . ." and he goes on and on about
        this girl.  The teacher's comment at the bottom is "This person
        should have died before you were born."  Now if the kid doesn't
        get the point of the essay title, the kid's *not* going to get
        the comment either . . .

(On the other hand, the kid might be awfully bright and the teacher might
 be pretty dumb.  But who knows?)

        . . . Another girl, who through other papers I realized was 16
        years old, unmarried, living at home with a new baby and being
        knocked about by her parents, wrote in an essay, "Sometimes
        teachers don't understand that maybe students like me have
        problems that make it difficult to do our best school work,
        such as perhaps maybe we have a baby, no boy friend, and we
        have a dad who knocks us around, and maybe we don't have any
        money, and . . ." etc.  The teacher's comment is, "Too many
        run-on sentences.  D minus." . . .

A fine comment from a member of the same generation who, in the preface
 to the manual for the Japanese firm C. Itoh &amp; Co.'s CI-300 dot matrix
  printer, tells us that "as a matter of course, the final goal is just
   simply to help achieve 'super shuttle diplomacy' between cool data,
    perhaps earned by HOST COMPUTER, and warm heart of human being."

Words to live by.  Aloha.

Good to hear from you, Jym, it has been far too long! The opening of your
contribution reminds me of an old Reader's Digest joke. Picture to
yourselves a small town where there is no municipal garbage pickup. Perfect
entrepreneurial opportunity for a dude with a pickup truck and a couple of
kids to help out with tossing garbage bags into the back of the truck, and
so it happened. On a fine fall day, the back of the truck was full of
papers and a good brisk wind was blowing. And garbage was blown out of the
back of the truck. "Get out of the cab, kids, and go lie down on top of the
garbage." The truck stops at a red light, and our amateur garbageman hears
a startled exclamation from the curb. "Look at that! Somebody's thrown away
two perfectly good children!"

And speaking of super shuttle diplomacy":

Subj:   for Desperado -- Does your output find you irresistibly appealing?

According to section 3.9 of the Guide to Text Processing on VAX/VMS (order
number AI-Y502B-TE), EVE's DCL command can be used "to captivate output
in a buffer".  I wasn't quite sure that this meant what I thought it meant,
so to be sure, I looked it up.  Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary
(1971) defines "captivate" as "to influence and dominate by some special
charm, art, or trait and with an irresistible appeal".

It's simply amazing what they can do in software nowadays.

It's 10 p.m. Do you know where your children are?  No?  Well, just
dial them up on your computer, via satellite link to the tiny implant
embedded just behind their left ears.

This is not science fiction.  Dr. Daniel Man, a Boca Raton plastic
surgeon, just won a patent on the basic technology.

He says the satellite link won't work until he perfects techniques
for making the human body act as an antenna.  Be he predicts its use
by parents, pet owners, overseas workers in potential hostage
situations, Alzheimers's patients and police tracking criminals or
parolees.

Does Dr. Man see any hint of Big Brother in all of this?

"Yes, but I don't want to go into it.  I'm more into the technical
aspects."

                Condominium Community College of Southern California

               A major problem faced by many Cognitive Scientists has  been
          the latent desire to be a rock'n'roll star, without the requisite
          talent[1].  Recent advances in connectionist learning  mechanisms
          (Sutton,  1987) have obviated this need.  In this work we present
          the design for the *connectionist air guitar* [2]
          -  the  first  air guitar to actually produce the notes played.

               This work was motivated by the observation that  it  is  not
          hard  for  people  to  play the songs of their favorite groups on
          their *internal phonograph*[3] (Kosslyn, 1977).  Thus  the  problem
          may simply be one of poor mapping hardware.  This  suggests  that
          augmentation  by  cognitive models may be useful.  PDP models are
          the  obvious  candidate  for  this  task,  given  that  they  are
          "neurally-inspired", or "brain-like"[4].  In this talk we present
          the first true augmentation of the mind by a connectionist model,
          called Neuro-Acoustic Programming.

               We use a  three-layer  system  as  follows:  Electrodes  are
          placed  on  the  subject's  scalp  using  the International 10-20
          system and amplified by Grass 7P511 preamplifiers[5].  These  are
          the  inputs  to  the  hidden units.  The output layer is simply a
          localist representation of the notes.  These are then  interfaced
          with a standard guitar synthesizer.

               In training, the subject listens to Springsteen  while  "air
          guitaring"  the lead.  The EEG drives the network, resulting in a
          set of outputs.  This result is  then  compared  to  the  correct
          output  (the  *music teacher* signal)  at  small  delta t's using
          Sutton's temporal difference method, and  the  errors  are  back-
          propagated  in  the  usual  way.   After  two albums, the network
          learns to produce the desired notes from the EEG.  Of  note  here
          is  that  the  hidden units develop a distributed encoding of the
          *qualia* of the notes, including coarsely-coded features sufficient
          to distinguish Jerry  Garcia  from  Conway  Twitty[6].   However,
          myogram  noise  in the EEG often leads to noise in the output, so
          it appears necessary to  implant  arrays  of  silicon  electrodes
          (developed  by  Jim  Bower at CalTech) directly into the temporal
          lobes, eliminating interference from  muscle  signals.   In  this
          case, the network must actually be borne to run.
          ------------------------------------
             [1]One approach is to ignore this  and  form  a  band  anyway.
          People who took this tack started the punk movement.
             [2]An  *air guitar* is a conceptual representation of a guitar,
          played in synchrony with actual music.  A cult has formed  around
          this  endeavor,  with many contests currently being held in local
          bars.
             [3]Some  people  claim that they actually *can't* play the songs
          internally as well as they hear them.  This is the "bad cognitive
          needle"  problem,  or,  in  the  case  of Kosslyn's more advanced
          *internal cassette player* model, "air heads." As long as the  sig-
          nal  uniquely  specifies  the  song,  it  still maps to the right
          notes, so this technique is useful for the hard of thinking.
             [4]This  is  to  be  contrasted  with  "neurally-expired",  or
          "brain-dead" models.
             [5]Other types of Grass amplifiers produce  a  more  "sixties-
          like" sound.
             [6]Some hidden units convert six into nine, the so-called
           *Jimi Hendrix* units (Easy Rider, 1969).

The theme of issue number 1151 reminds me of a Chinese restaurant in
Broolkyn Heights (Brooklyn, NY, that is).  It was one of the "first"
Szechuan restaurants in New York when america discovered that Chinese
food wasn't just Chop Suey.  The restaurant was named Chuan Yuan (or
"golden plate") and their motto was:

Was that your personal account of gourmandizing your way through Montreal?
If so, you have a prompt "right-on" or "allez-y" from these quarters for
your description of Le Troika.  Emily et Moi would go to Montreal on a
twice a year basis when Elizabeth was a student at McGill.  We went there
once, and found things as you describe them.  I enjoyed a rack of lamb
that hasn't been equalled--before or since.

Two other Montreal restaurant suggestions.  Leo Foo's in Montreal's Chinatown
is a perfect way to break the Yom Kippur fast.  There's also my personal
quirk--they have real Tunisian restaurants and if you ask them to make the
dishes authentic--to their taste, not Canadian palates, they will give you
food to make a Cajun cry.  Just tell the waiter,"Ismah, Ya Chooya, Nheb el
-mekla, haar yessar!"  That should do it; the Ch in Chooya is pronounced
like Hanukah--not like Chelsea.

I wouldn't ever pay for a copy of the Toronto Sun, but if I find one
abandoned on the subway, I flip through it.  In this morning's Sun, I found
this rendering of a UPI article:

  U.S. Computers Snatched

  Stockholm (UPI) -- Swedish police issued a national alert for two stolen
  U.S. microcomputers classified as strategic materials, fearing a thief would
  sell them to Soviet-bloc countries.  The two Micro-Wax 2 computers were
  stolen Saturday from Uppsala University.

Subj:   Notice of Downtime on BITNET host

IPFRCVM - Iowa Pig Farm Research Center will be down tomorrow from
20:00-23:00 for system maintenance.  Since we are an end node, nobody
will be affected except for us.

It turns out that one of our sows got in through a hole in the
wall and had her litter of piglets under our raised floor.  The
operator on duty got quite a scare when he heard a number of
squeels.  He assumed we had some massive head crashes and powered
down the CPU.  Since the squeals continued we traced it to a
corner under our raised floors.  We will be off the air tonight so
that we can power down again and get the sow and her piglets out
from under the floor.

Subj:   Does Desperado take serious articles?

Enclosed is an interesting article from Usenet.  It is a response to
an on-going argument between (roughly) Henry Spencer of the Univ. of
Toronto who writes small, carefully constructed programns, and supporters
of Richard Stallman, who writes programs that require "modern" large-address
space machines.  (Stallman has not contributed to the discussion.)

From: srg@quick.COM (Spencer Garrett)
Newsgroups: comp.arch
Subject: Small is beautiful
Message-ID: &lt;121@quick.COM&gt;
Date: 21 Sep 87 03:09:42 GMT
Organization: Quicksilver Engineering, Seattle
Lines: 46

I'd like to start by saying that I'm firmly in Henry Spencer's camp on this
one.  Performance isn't the only benefit, however.  Smaller programs are
easier to write, debug, maintain, and (drumroll here) *use*.  I measure
"small" by economy of concepts more than line or byte counts, though they
tend to follow.  Let me give an example.  For many years (back in the dark
ages) I used TECO as my primary text editor.  I used it day in and day out,
and I consider myself a wizard (I wrote a multi-user, protected mode OS
for the PDP-8 during this time!), but I *never* reached the point where I
didn't want the TECO manual handy at all times.  Later I found myself in
charge of a system with a screen-oriented editor very reminiscent of TECO
(you know - every ascii code is a command, and then some).  These editors
are very powerful, (I've seen a screen editor written as a TECO macro, for
pete's sake!) but they are complicated to use and impossible to remember.
Well, *everyone* waited to use the screen editor rather than using the line
editor, but it only ran on an expensive vector display which we couldn't
afford to replicate.  I spent quite a while watching how people used it
before starting to write a screen editor which would run on ordinary terminals
(this was pre-UNIX and very pre-VI).  I discovered that half a dozen commands
constituted nearly the entire working set for most users.  Most of the time
they would hold the right arrow key down and let it auto-repeat to get to
the end of the line, rather than trying to remember the direct sequence.  I
decided that what people needed was an editor simple enough to use that it
wouldn't get in their way, so they could think about the program and not
about the editor.  Well, I wrote it and it has many rabid adherents to this
day.  It has grown to a whopping 2800 lines of C, and nobody bothers to keep
the manual handy.  It takes about 32k + buffer(expanding) and averages
1/6th the cpu of vi.  It has maybe 20% of the functionality of vi, but that's
more than almost anybody can remember how to use in vi.  The source code for
vi, on the other hand, is twice as big as the V7 kernel, and there are well-
known bugs that nobody can find.  On the other end of the scale, I've seen
a single copy of EMACS bring a 750 to its knees, and you have to think very
carefully about every keystroke or you may delete every source file in the
county.  The difference here is one of design, not implementation.  I couldn't
write vi in 2800 lines, much less EMACS.  I simply chose to seek the essence
of editing, not the outer limits.  It was exactly this feeling which gave us
UNIX instead of VMS, and I don't think the shrinking cost of mips and megabytes
is any reason to abandon the quest.  I therefore humbly proclaim Spencer's Law:

        No program over 10,000 lines long can ever be made to work (correctly).

I think this fundamental constant describes people, not computers, but that
is, after all, what this business is really about.

I hereby don my asbestos suit and set my autodialer to 911 ---

The hell of it is, he's right. 80% of the time, 80% of the functionality
will do. What keeps us in time-to-market limbo is the other 20%...as in

Subj:   Lions &amp; tigers &amp; bugs! Oh My!

                                 The Last Bug
                                 ============

                         "But you're out of your mind,"
                         They said with a shrug,
                         "...the customer is happy!
                         What's one little bug?"

                         But he was determined,
                         The others went home.
                         He spread out the program,
                         Deserted, alone.

                         The cleaning crew came,
                         the whole room was cluttered...
                         ...with memory-dumps and listings...
                         "I'm close...", he muttered.

                         The mumbling got louder,
                         "Simple deduction...!
                         I've got it! It's right!
                         ..Just change one instruction!"

                         But it still wasn't perfect.
                         As year followed year,
                         And strangers would comment:
                         "Is that guy still here?"

                         So he died at the console,
                         Of hunger and thirst.
                         Next day they buried him...
                         ...face down, nine-edge first.

                         And the last bug in sight,
                         an ant passing by,
                         Saluted his tombstone...
                         ...and whispered:  "Nice try!"
