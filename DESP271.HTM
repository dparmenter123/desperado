                      ME AND MY OPERATING SYSTEMS

 When I studied MACRO-11, they put me down in front of a bare-bones
 PDP-11 and handed me many twirls of yellow tape, "the loader", "the
 Sunnyvale editor", my "program".  I toggled in a bootstrap address,
 watched the blinks and then loaded "the loader" and loaded my
 "program" which didn't run, then loaded "the loader" again to load
 "the Sunnyvale editor" whose mysterious operations I no longer
 recall, then again with "the loader" to load my "program" which
 blinked a light or two and shut down.  Since I had just been hired to
 write about operating systems I asked the instructor innocently, "So,
 where's the operating system in all this?"  "It's in your lap.  It's
 right there in your lap."

 Since then, I've been involved as a user and more on RSX systems,
 Unix, the Symbolic Lisp Machine, and now (alas) DOS and Windows, and
 us PC people are geting screwed.  Thus, the following reminiscences.

 RSX (Dave Cutler's first big production) was a real-time system that
 ran real nice on anybody's PDP-11 and was popular for program
 development.  It had a full set of tools for operating the computer,
 three or four text editors, not to mention editors for object files
 and even task images, a neat viewer where you could see exactly what
 was going on in memory, every possible parameter was there to be
 tweaked because of the variety of machines it ran on and devices
 supported.  This thing was documented, in stupefying, but consistent,
 detail, in about 35 books.  It had a simple well-behaved
 file-management program and directory structure.  It could support a
 huge amount of memory (PDP-11 style memory), but it retained most of
 its fundamental capacity in systems with 28K of memory.  It provided
 a nice array of tools for getting it to do exactly what you wanted.
 I once did a chart for RSX doc that I wanted to call "There must be
 50 ways to spool your output".  In my own involvement, I actually
 fantasized taking this creature of the real-time lab out into the
 mass market (which actually happened in a small way).  I'm sure it
 was laughable, but it's where I broke in and got my first idea of
 what an operating system was going to do for me, run my programs,
 store and delete my files, keep things orderly and stay out of the
 way, provide a reasonable means to automate and customize its
 operations.

 VMS, another Cutler system, was much like RSX.  (In fact, in its
 first release it *was* RSX.)  VMS has everything, and more, once
 again, documented, interfaced, interlocked and interlaced, ready for
 its user to make of it what she will.  Certainly VMS is both stuffy
 and a sprawling hog and could never by any stretch of the imagination
 travel far from "the machine room", but, again, for the kind of
 things most of us want out of our computers -- running programs,
 managing files, setting up an environment the way we like, editing,
 doing mail, doing newsgroups (that is, VAX Notes), printing files and
 so forth, logging in on other systems, all the things we do on our
 PCs are markedly easier to do on VMS than they are on the PC.

 So, given this DEC background of square operating systems, where the
 three letters after the dot in a filespec actually meant something
 and did something, I've made my share of fun of Unix.  Still, I've
 been using Unix myself lately while exploring the job market and
 I'll have to say that it has sort of won me over.  I love the
 feeling that just below the placid exterior of the system prompt an
 entire world of seething software waits and all I have to do is toss
 the right mixture of monkey claws and flash powder at the prompt and
 demons will arise to do my bidding, to my growing horror, my *exact*
 bidding.

 You'd could make a hell of an operating system out of Unix.  I
 wonder why nothing's ever come of it.  Unix is really made right,
 like it should be. C is everywhere and can fix every problem (except
 in the kingdom of Emacs where Lisp maintains its sway).  Unix is so
 much of what I want an operating system to be, alert, reliable (in
 my modest demand zone), flexible, brainy, even lovable, so why is it
 such a drag?  Why hasn't more come of it?  Why does Unix remain
 untamed?  Why, in all these years, with all that creativity, has no
 common set of simple commands emerged? Type, Dir, Copy, Append,
 Delete, Print, Find, Whatever.  I'm as charmed by Unset Noclobber as
 I can be and I love the way none of the Emacs documentation ever
 deigns to mention the arrow keys: "C-p, C-n, C-f, C-p were good
 enough for my granddad and they're good enough for me.  You might
 have to run Unix on an oscilloscope some day so stay away from those
 wimpy arrow keys."

 Why has no one taken this marvelous bag of tricks and hit the big
 time with it?  Surely, with the power of awk and sed, not to mention
 those slaphappy pipes, you could solve just about any problem under
 the sun with Unix, and yet Unix remains in the shadows, where it was
 born with the curse of unlimited potential.  I speak in ignorance
 here.  I know that the original NeXt windows system ran on Unix and,
 of course, X (bulimic gesture), but how come there's not a homely
 little command language shell on every Unix system?  But no, once
 you've sipped the waters of this anti-Nepenthe you're cursed forever
 to suffer the brutality of manpages and Berkeley, Bourne and System
 V, not to mention shell commands documented in three separate
 alphabetical lists.  Unix is the most fabulous Erector set ever made,
 but nobody ever stops to make a ferris wheel, they just keep making
 more Erector set parts.  When Unix people feel really creative, they
 make knockoffs of Unix and Emacs.  Linux, Ultrix, OSF, GNU . . .

 Dennis Ritchie wrote an absolute *flame* foreword to "The Collected
 Unix-Haters Mail", jeering, "The systems you remember so fondly
 (TOPS-20, ITS, Multics, Lisp Machine, Cedar/Mesa, the Dorado) are
 not just out to pasture, they are fertilizing it from below."  And,
 in a second s2t-based trope:  "Your book is a pudding stuffed with
 apposite observations, many well-conceived.  Like excrement, it
 contains enough undigested nuggets of nutrition to sustain life for
 some.  But it is not a tasty pie:  it reeks too much of contempt and
 of envy."

 I've already said I'm not a Unix hater, but you'd think, almost,
 that he doth sound a little . . . could it be?  . . . guilty here.

 The Symbolics Lisp Machine was a much nicer place to live than Unix
 could ever be.  For the, how many can it been, five or six thousand
 people in the world who ever had the pleasure, there has never been a
 better "operating system".  Instead of a rat's nest of icons and
 "tiled" windows or a nasty little prompt accepting nasty little
 commands, you had an infinite number of dynamic windows, each taking
 up a full screen and each only a keystroke away from the others.  At
 each window you could switch willy-nilly from a command line to a
 menu any time you liked.  For every user action there was a command,
 a key accelerator, a mouse click and a function you could run to do
 what you wanted done.  Everything that you had ever done since
 booting was maintained in a complex of histories, not just command
 lines, but pathnames, arguments, God knows what, all semantically
 distinguished so that it was impossible to give the system a wrong
 value.  Across the bottom of the screen lay the mouse documentation
 line, stating clearly what each of the mouse buttons would do if
 you clicked at that moment.  When in doubt you could sort of wave
 the mouse around looking for something you liked the looks of.  And,
 in the background, as many as five varieties of garbage collectors
 chewing away like rats or benign bacteria at all the debris in
 memory.  For a casual user, which I certainly was, you could stay up
 a month or more at a time without having to reboot.

 Did you see that, Bill Gates?  A month or two at a time.  On my PC,
 I know that if I've just about got my environment where I want it
 that the next thing that I do is likely to wedge the whole damn
 show.  Whereupon I reboot, perhaps for the fourth or fifth time that
 day.  Everything up to this point should be taken as an implicit
 criticism of DOS and Windows.  From now on, it will be explicit.

 Isn't it strange that I can reboot my PC by pressing CTRL/ALT/DELETE,
 by flipping a switch on the front of the system box, or by turning
 the surge protector off and on again?  And, each method of rebooting
 produces *entirely* *different* *results*! And, instead of 50 ways to
 spool my output, there is but one, find some program that can print
 and print it from there.  Hello, Write, the little word processor
 that could.

 I don't believe for a minute that the various DOS prompts scattered
 hopefully throughout Windows do the same thing as the real DOS
 prompt.

 I love having thirty-plus "program groups", most of them containing a
 group consisting of one program (and all of them looking alike until
 I bought a $13 accessory to allow me to change them).  Where there's
 more than one member of a group, the others are usually improperly
 integrated add-ons of some kind or lamebrained release notes
 detailing the contortions you have to go through to get the programs
 to run *after* they have been installed.  The logic by which a RUN
 command is hard and this crap is easy escapes me.  And, of course, as
 for removing programs, well, good luck.  And isn't it peachy to get a
 chance to learn so much about serial ports and parallel ports and
 interrupt request queues?  And, since these things are so important,
 why can't I find out which programs are assigned to which ports and
 IRQs?

 And how about taking the same time and the same number of keystrokes
 to do something a dozen times a day as it takes to do something you
 might do once a year?  How come the last pathname I enter doesn't
 stay there the until the next time I come back?  There's nothing
 sticky or consistent about any behavior in DOS/Windows.  I went to
 delete all my *.tmp files last week.  On a "hard-to-use professional
 programmer's system", I'd have put together some kind of file mask,
 done a DIR with the mask just to check what I was doing, and then
 replaced the DIR with a DEL to do the job.  But on the PC I had to
 pipe the output of the DIR to a file and then do a global search and
 replace to stick a DEL in front of every filename to make a .BAT file
 to do the job.  Indeed, I can't do any wildcarding at all in Windows
 as far as I can see, not even with the wonderful little WizManager
 Pro program that turns the Windows File Manager into something
 remotely resembling a file manager and kicks the accursed Program
 Manager out of bed for most purposes.  And why did I have to poke
 through online shareware archives to get something (for which I
 gladly paid $35 after evaluation) that should have been built into
 the system in the first place?  And, furthermore, how come there
 were 3.5 meg of .TMP files stashed away in a WINDOWS subdirectory?
 Garbage garbage garbage.

 Not the saddest words of tongue or pen, but pretty sad nonetheless,
 are "Bob is an operating system built on top of Windows which is built
 on top of DOS."  Why not just build up DOS?  It would appear that
 Windows isn't much more than a piss-poor memory management extension
 to DOS that's so hard to use that yet another "easy to use" system
 (with a built-in phony smile) has to be slopped on top of it?  All of
 this edifice is perched on top of a system designed fifteen years ago
 to operate controllers.  So here we have bitter rivals, RSX, VMS,
 Unix, and Lisp Machine, also built many years ago, each intended for
 use by experts and each of them far easier to use, more forgiving,
 more stable and more flexible than the only operating system 99 per
 cent of all computer users have ever seen.

 Many years ago, when Bill Gates was just a pup, he was written up by
 the Wall Street Journal as a young programmer with a future.  "His
 code is so tightly written", the Journal gushed, "that other
 programmers are incapable of working on it."  A friend commented,
 "That proves Gates has always been a better marketer than engineer,
 even when he was just an engineer".  The OS/2 debacle is another
 instance.

 I dream of the day when all of us who have participated in the
 operating system wars -- Unix-haters and Unix-lovers alike -- can
 band together to build an operating system that will run on a PC,
 providing a solid environment for running DOS and Windows programs
 and yet still providing a straightforward, practical, well-documented
 honest user experience.  Please, if the urge hits you to write one
 more Unix, think, couldn't I do more for the world by killing DOS and
 Windows?

 PS -- This is odd, but I'd hardly spent more than a day or two on a
 Mac when I started writing this, and I was glad I knew nothing,
 because I did not want to write another Mac versus PC flame.  In the
 middle or writing this, I started working on a Mac project, but I
 assure you that had nothing to do with my views on DOS and Windows.

A week or so ago a friend and I stopped by Cybersmith/Smitty's On-Line

informed that the computer that issues the cards was down and even if we
had cards, the card swipe on the PCs at the tables wouldn't read them.
The manager sighed "Computers!" . My friend and I laughed out loud and

[copyright 1995, Russll Sadler]

I am enclosing a column I wrote a couple of weeks ago. I am a very
mainstream, mass media journalist. For the last 25 years I have syndicated
a daily radio and television commentary and a weekly newspaper column. The
broadcasts are carried on 5 commercial television stations  and 6 radio
stations in Oregon and Northern California. Two radio stations are public,
the rest are commercial.  The column is carried in daily and weekly
newspapers around Oregon.

I think you will find this column is a different explanation for the
new congressional leadership's effort to "defund" public broadcasting.

*********Begin Column**********

Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media baron, stupefied the media
business when his Fox network outbid the venerable CBS for the rights to
broadcast National Football League games this year. People in the television
business knew Fox did not own enough stations in the top 50 media
markets to charge enough  for commercials to recover the $1.6 billion
Murdoch spent taking the NFL away from CBS. Rupert Murdoch is no fool with
his money. The industry waited for Murdoch to drop the other shoe.

There was less surprise when Murdoch announced his holding company
paid $500 million for a 20 percent interest in the New World Communication
Group, Inc. New World owns six television stations in the top 20 markets,
four in the top 50 markets and two in the top 70, including stations in
Dallas, the 8th largest market andDetroit, the 9th largest. Murdoch
switched most of these stations from CBS affiliates to his Fox network. Now
Murdoch had the means to charge more for commercials in the NFL games.
Despite this brilliant high stakes entrepreneurship, Murdoch apparently
lost $350 million in his $2.1 billion bid to build a national network.  He
needs more stations in the largest television markets.

There are no television frequencies available, especially the more
lucrative VHF channels 2 - 13. They are licensed to ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox
affiliates, a variety of independent stations and public television
stations.

Enter Big Bird and Barney, two of public television's artistic and
financial success stories. The new Republican leadership began a campaign
to convince the American people Big Bird and Barney and their "elitist"
audience were responsible for the national debt.

Government has no business doing what private enterprise can do
better, chanted the ideologues. They do not explain why the vast wasteland
of commercial television did not produce its own Big Bird and Barney
instead of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
Sen. Larry Pressler, R-South Dakota and chair of the Senate Commerce
Committee announced Bell Atlantic was prepared to take Big Bird and Barney
off the government's hands and syndicate it to cable, satellite and
television outlets. Americans could still enjoy Big Bird - for a fee, of
course.

There is a hollow, leaden ring to this heated, ideological
rhetoric. Congress spends about as much on military bands as it spends on
public broadcasting. Pressler comes from a sparsely populated state that
has one of the largest public broadcasting audiences in the country. It
can't be the money.  Pressler can't be reflecting the views of his
constituents. Congress really isn't after the public broadcasting's liberal
bias - real or imagined. It turns out the new congressional leadership
wants the public broadcasting channels, especially in the top 50 markets.

Public broadcasting licenses are owned by a variety of state and
local governments, non-profit groups, colleges and universities. If the
congress cuts public broadcasting funds and these stations are forced off
the air, the government can reissue the licenses. Guess who is waiting in
line.

Shortly after Murdoch's Harper Collins publishing company offered
House Speaker Newt Gingrich the controversial $4.5 million book deal,
Murdoch and other broadcasters asked for and got closed door meetings with
House Republicans and Pressler's Commerce Committee staff. No one knows for
sure what went on in these "private" meetings but reporters for Newsday and
Los Angeles Times columnist Lars-Erik Nelson believe turning public
broadcasting channels over to private broadcasters was a topic of discussion.

Bell Atlantic tried to make a deal with Murdoch last year for the
20th Century Fox film library worth an estimated $4 billion. Murdoch wants
to sell, apparently to raise cash to replace the money he is losing on the
NFL. Bell Atlantic has cash from its telephone operations and wants the
film library to supply its planned venture into home entertainment. The
deal fell apart when Bell Atlantic decided it did not have enough broadcast
outlets to pay the bill. Bell Atlantic executives met privately with
Pressler to complain about the lack of broadcasting frequencies in major
television markets. Privately, the new congressional leadership believes
public broadcasting stands in the way of restructuring the new electronic
media and the solution is just turn off the spigot that pays for Big Bird
and Barney.

The federal government holds a 13 year lien on any public
broadcasting facility built with grants from the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. Those facilities include much of the modernized studio and
transmission equipment in the largest markets and the extensive translator
networks built by rural public stations like Jefferson Public Radio. If
these stations cease broadcasting because of a lack of money, the federal
government can just take over the property, issue the licenses to private
operators and sell the lucrative studio and transmission facilities to
their campaign contributors.

There is a surprising reason for this intense interest in
old-fashioned television stations in the age of cable, satellite
transmission and optic fiber cables. Murdoch's satellite television
service demonstrated a revolutionary transmission technology that
compresses signals 8 to 1.

Stripped of technobabble, that means within a
decade it will be possible to transmit eight separate digital broadcast
signals on television channels that can only transmit one now. If existing
television stations can deliver 30 or more  channels of home enetertainment
into the Top 150 American television markets, it will drastically
alter the economics of the cable and telephone industries.

Murdoch's compression technology will permit today's commercial and
public television broadcasters - long dismissed as technological dinosaurs
- - to compete with cable, telephone and satellite transmissions companies or
even short-circuit their potentially lucrative market.

Perhaps the bitter battle over Big Bird and Barney's future makes a
bit more sense now.

 Public broadcasting's stance in the debate over public broadcasting
 has been pretty pathetic:  We hardly get any money from the
 government and it's only 97 cents per person, so please don't take
 our lifeblood away.  This piece puts a new slant on things at least.
