On page 34 of this month's Scientific American there's an article
on "Digital Desperados".  They're described as "criminals that write
newsletters" and "predators on society".  Is that what's been going
on here, crime and predation?  Shame on you!

        I was at a popular fishing spot along the Charles river today and
        noticed a bit of litter lying there.  Since I wasn't reading
        anything at the moment and the litter had printing on it, I quite
        naturally picked it up.  It was the packaging from "Babe
        Winkelman's Master's Series Wormblower", manufactured, as many of
        you may already know, by Lindy Little Joe Famous Fishing Products.

        What, then, is a Wormblower?

        It is a device for inflating worms.

        "Night Crawlers inflated and used on our Lindy Rig-Floating Rig or
        Red Devils are fish getters!  Blowing up a crawler not only keeps
        it off the bottom, but can make a skimpy, shriveled up crawler look
        like a super worm."

        It's basically a squeeze bottle with a hypodermic needle that you
        stick right behind the thick part on a worm and "squeeze worm
        blower, being careful not to rupture crawler".  All for $1.29.

        Iran, that is, Persia, has been right where it is since about 550
        BC, when it was founded by a cat named Cyrus.  The Roman Empire
        lapped at its borders for centuries, but did not wash it away.  Nor
        did the Ottoman Empire (despite 200 years occupation), nor the
        Huns, nor modern imperialism, nor the CIA.  Look at any map of the
        past 2500 years and there it is, same shape, same size, varying
        governments, but the same folks, more or less, geographically
        favored for thousands of years.  Iraq, on the other hand, was
        invented by the British Foreign Office in 1916 and run as an
        owned-and-operated subsidiary until not too long ago.  Before that,
        where Iraq now stands there was Mesopotamia, Luristan, Shahrzur,
        Kurdistan, and, for centuries, off and on, Persia (Seleucid
        Kingdom, Parthian Empire, you know), the traditional enemy.

        Saddam Hussein, however, would like for the world to confuse Iraq
        with Babylonia, and, for even more fun, he'd like to identify
        himself with Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled in Babylonia in the sixth
        century BC, about the same time Iran was setting up shop.

        The follies of rulers are endless, but this seems to be overdoing
        it.  Nebuchadnezzar is best known these days as the subject of
        poetry:

                Nebuchadnezzar,
                King of the Jews,
                Spell it with two letters
                and I'll give you some shoes.

        He did, in fact, conquer the Jews.  And he was a mighty king of the
        Babylonians.  Discourse with him always began, "O King, live
        forever."  This did not work.  He is now dead.

        Nebuchadnezzar had a weird dream and called all his magicians,
        enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers and asked them, not merely
        to interpret the dream, but to tell him what the dream was and
        *then* interpret it.  He offered to cut them up in little bits if
        they couldn't do it.  They said they couldn't do it, so
        Nebuchadnezzar really had no choice but to cut them into bits.

        In his service at that time, hired after an extensive recruiting
        program among the conquered people, was a Jew named Daniel (not yet
        revealed to be the Prophet Daniel), who was working as an
        administrator.  Even though Daniel wasn't actually in the bureau of
        magic and fortune-telling, he and his fellow Jewish administrators
        (Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, if you must know) were included in
        the puhishment.  Daniel said, "Hey, no problem, I'll tell him what
        it all meant."  Fortunately for Daniel, God rewarded his faith and
        revealed Nebuchadnezzar's dream to Daniel, whereupon Daniel related
        it to the king.

        "You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue --
        an enormous dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.  The head of
        the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its
        belly and thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of
        iron and partly of baked clay."  (Keep an eye on those clay feet.)

        "While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human
        hands.  It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and
        smashed them.  Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and
        the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like
        chaff on a threshing floor in the summer.  The wind swept them away
        without leaving a trace.  But the rock that struck the statue
        became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."

        Daniel interpreted this dream much as any one of us might,
        basically as a disaster for pride, but Nebuchadnezzar was mighty
        impressed anyway, actually prostrating himself before Daniel,  and
        then he put Daniel in charge as chief of the magicians.  Shadrach,
        Meshach, and Abednego got good patronage jobs too, governing
        provinces.

        Nebuchadnezzar built a gold statue of himself 90 feet high and
        nine feet wide and made everybody fall down and worship it every
        time they heard music.  No worship, and into the fiery furnace
        with 'em.  Natch, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego weren't doing it.
        Even before they had been raised up to seats of power they had
        refused to eat the palace food on the grounds that they were
        vegetarians and they were sure as hell (real hell in those days)
        not going to worship any golden statues.  "Throw us in the fiery
        furnace", they said.  The Babylonians did, but, as you would know
        if you hadn't been raised in heathen times, or if you listen to a
        lot of gospel music, nothing happened to them in the furnace.
        Nebuchadnezzar decided the Jewish god was too powerful even for
        him and gave all three of them a promotion.  (Daniel was
        apparently out of town during all this.)

        Then Nebuchadnezzar had another portentous dream.  This time he
        told Daniel what it was before asking him to interpret it:  "These
        are the visions  I saw while lying in my bed:  I looked, and there
        before me stood a tree in the middle of the land.  Its height was
        enormous.  The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the
        skiy; it was visible to the ends of the earth.  its leaves were
        beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all.  Under
        it the beasts of the field found shelter and the birds of the air
        lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.

        "In the visions I saw while laying in my bed, I looked,  and there
        before me was a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven.  He
        called in a loud voice: 'Cut down the tree and trim off its
        branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.  Let the
        animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.  But
        let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in
        the ground, in the grass of the field.

        "'Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with
        the animals among the plants of the earth.  Let his mind be
        changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an
        animal, till seven times pass by for him.'"

        Daniel immediately commented that it was too bad the dream applied
        to Nebuchadnezzar and not to his enemies.  "You, O King, are that
        tree."  He then implored the king to straighten up and fly right.

        But he didn't even straighten up, much less fly right.  A year
        later he was walking on his roof and blowing his own horn -- "Is
        this not the great Babylon I have built as my royal residence, by
        my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?" -- when back came
        the answer, out of the sky:  "You will be driven away from your
        people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like
        cattle.  Secven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge
        that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives
        them to anyone he wishes."

        And, guess what, it happened.  Nebuchadnezzar was "driven away from
        people and ate grass like cattle.  His body was drenched with the
        dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and
        his nails like the claws of a bird."

        He later repented and once again acknowledged that the Jewish god
        had some mighty stuff going and that he'd better stick with the
        program, whereupon his kingdom was restored, but no more golden
        idols and bad acting allowed.  Daniel continued along having
        visions, adventures in the lion's den, saw the handwriting on the
        wall, and even took another gig interpreting dreams, for Cyrus,
        founder of the Persia that lasted so much longer than Babylon.

        In the meantime, here is Sadam Hussein, wanting to be like
        Nebuchadnezzar and threatening the Jews.  In Baghdad (which is not
        historical Babylon), he has built a giant arch of two swords, each
        sword grasped in a huge stone hand six feet high, each stone hand
        engraved with the deep-grooved fingerprints of Saddam Hussein.

        Percy B. Shelley dealt with the phenomenon in "Ozymandias":

                I met a traveller from an antique land
                Who said:  Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
                Stand in the desert . . . near them, on the sand,
                Half-sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command
                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
                The hand that mocked them, and the heard that fed;
                And on the pedestal, these words appear:
                'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings,
                Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'
                Nothing beside remains, round the decay
                Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
                The lone and level sands stretch far away.

        On the other hand, if you look at the map, it's pretty surprising
        that Kuwait managed to stay out of Iraqi hands for as long as it
        did.  The British Foreign Office decreed Kuwait to exist to keep
        the Mesopotamians (later the Iraqis) from getting to the Gulf, much
        as if the French had decided to sell us the Louisiana Purchase but
        to keep the actual Louisiana part for themselves.

Now all I need is an online copy so I don't have to find mine and type it

Well, they got Aardu, the Stone Zoo's wallaby who made a jump for it a
few weeks ago, and had been living in the woods.  Capturing him turned
out to be easy: they doused some hay with female wallaby urine, baited
a trap with it, and let his raging hormones betray him.

It wouldn't have worked with on a female wallaby, of course.  She
would have taken one sniff and said, "I knew it -- the lazy son of a
bitch is still pissing in the hay!  Let him clean it up himself!!"  And
hopped away.

Dave Barry says somewhere that men are so clueless about women that they
actually think that standing on the corner and making lip-smacking sounds

        Never zero in.

And winging it with a whole new theme after "obscurity" (c.w.c.i.d: blame

This is taken wildly out of context from "That Old 'Picayune-Moon'", by
Garrison Keillor, in the September 1990 Harper's.

"It dawned on me in that moment that a good newspaper is never nearly good
enough but a lousy newspaper is a joy forever.  These words ought to be

The old 'coke' program that once ran in our department has been
resurvived and extended.  Its major lack in functionality is now
covered, and the program appropriately renamed "jf" (junk food).
The man pages for jf and xmnm are included.

NAME
     jf - Inquire about availability of junk foods in CMU CS
     vending machines.

SYNOPSIS
     jf [coke | mnm | mm ] [-reset]

DESCRIPTION
     jf inquires about the availability of Coke/Diet-Coke and
     M&amp;Ms in the CMU CS vending area to save addicts an abortive
     trip from their distant offices.

     With no argument or with single argument coke jf gives the
     status of the buttons of 16oz bottles in the CMU CS Coke
     machine.  With argument mnm or mm it will give an estimate
     of the number of servings of M&amp;Ms left in the vending
     machine.

     Providing an argument to identify the machine and the argu-
     ment -reset allows the vending machine fillers to inform the
     server when the machines have been refilled.  This is
     currently applicable only to the M&amp;M machine because the
     Coke interface is essentially self-monitoring.  Proper
     credentials are requested before a reset may be performed.

BUGS
     As of 22-June-90, only the M&amp;M interface is working.  The
     Coke interface is still being prepared.

NAME
     xmnm - X11 program to monitor the availability of M&amp;Ms.

SYNOPSIS
     xmnm [-update &lt;rate&gt;] [-shape | -noshape] [X11 switches]

DESCRIPTION
     Using an X11 window, xmnm graphically and continuously
     inquires about the availability of M&amp;Ms in the CMU CS vend-
     ing area to save addicts an abortive trip from their distant
     offices.

     With no -update argument xmnm will check the status of the
     M&amp;M machine every 1200 seconds (20 minutes).  By providing
     the -update argument, users can cause the status to be
     checked less or more frequently.  To keep the junk food
     server from becoming flooded with status requests, xmnm
     enforces a minimum sleeptime of 60 seconds.

     The -shape and -noshape arguments indicate whether the X
     window should take on the form of the M&amp;M machine.  By
     default, shaping will not be done.

COMMANDS
     Clicking any of the mouse buttons in the M&amp;M window will
     cause an update to occur.  That is, the junk food server
     will be queried.

BUGS
     Shaping just doesn't work sometimes, even though the
     software thinks it can be done.  Different window managers,
     mismatched versions of X, etc. can all contribute to the
     problem.

        Way back in the 60s, Vice President of the United States and real
        rich man, Nelson "What a way to go" Rockefeller, said, in his most
        phamous aforism:  "If you don't want it known, don't use the

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well Tom,   testing us again?  Rockefeller was Vice president to Ford, and
as we all know that was after Nixon in the early 70's.   Oh well your
focus must have been off thinking about the fireworks.

Of course you remember the comment about what would have happened to Aliens,
who stopped by the planet in 1910's saw the money with Ford and Rockefeller,
then in the 70's saw what could be purchased.

Subj:   The Psychodynamics of Abnormal Design

I've been enjoying Desperado now for some time.  Here's something the readers
will appreciate:

This article was recently uncovered from my ancient archives (i.e. the stuff
I never unpacked from the last time I moved).  It was written circa 1981, while
"Johnson" was still an undergraduate at the University of Michigan.

================================================================================

                The Psychodynamics of Abnormal Design

                        - an irrelevant observation by "Johnson"

Perhaps you have wondered why new cars are always different from old cars,
or why all television antennas look different, or why your new microwave
won't brown the meat.

Or it might have struck you as odd that coffee makers are beginning to take
on a striking resemblance to moonshine stills, or that stove burners now
look just like countertops, or that the center of Briarwood Mall is a maze
of ramps and rivers that cunningly prevents you from going anywhere in a
straight line.

Or perhaps you have merely lamented the fact that your children may never
know what "clockwise" means.

There is a sinister reason for all this confusion; a contagious psychosis
which causes the afflicted designer to take a simple and basic concept and
expand it into an unrecognizable collection of superfluous technology which
only rarely pretends to perform its primary function.  Loosely termed
"abnormal design tendency," it is actually a group of closely related
disorders such as simpliphobia, scifimania, and commonsense schizophrenia.

Possibly the single most destructive factor is the wanton compulsion to
modify a sound and proven design.  Most experts agree that this phenomenon
is somehow related to that of a dog in a new house urinating on all the
furniture.  According to veterinarian Sigmund Dogfood:

        "The beginning engineer feels that he has to mark out
        his territory immediately.  He therefore finds the first
        record he can read, and modifies it somehow, giving him
        the opportunity to put his initials on it.  Pleased with
        himself, he then sets his behavior pattern accordingly
        and often launches himself into a rewarding but
        thoroughly unproductive career."

But this is only a small part of the overall problem.  The worst offenders
by far are electrical engineers.  Often the most offhand remark or twisted
germ of an idea is enough to shatter their already tenuous grasp on reality
and launch them into a frenzy of incomprehensible scribbling and fervent
muttering, the end result of which lacks any sense or meaning whatsoever.
Unfortunately, it usually works and ends up in production.

Often, people think that this tendency to design incomprehensible circuitry
is merely a form of ego feeding, thinking that one is somehow superior since
no one else can understand his design.  One guilty party confessed a more
practical motive:

"As I see it," he said casually, as though he were not guilty of unspeakable
evil, "someone has to troubleshoot it.  Until someone else figures it out,
I've got a job."

This motivation is not universal, though.  Another perpetrator confided that
not even he understood his designs.

Computer engineers, although afflicted by this problem, completely eclipse
it with more exotic and unspeakable transgressions.  This bizarre subculture,
primarily cut off from the rest of civilization, has developed behavior
patterns completely alien to the bulk of mankind.  Although these odd habits
are staggering in their numbers, two predominate.

"Hacking" is a compulsive desire to spend days or weeks (world record: 14
years, 2 months, 6 days, 4 hours altering an error message, recorded by J.
Diewald) modifying perfectly functional software without substantially
changing its function.  No one knows what possesses these people to exert
so much effort for little or no results; most feel that an urge for anonymity
is the root.  As evidence against this, however, an inmate at Ypsilanti State
is reportedly still typing on an imaginary terminal.

"Wheel wars" are an even more unnerving concept.  This is either a strange
game or a thoroughly paranoiac activity in which several programmers,
apparently simultaneously and without prior communication, attempt to take
over the operating system of a medium to large computer.  Thousands of
man-hours are lost in this fashion, and nobody (except perhaps the programmers
themselves) understands the significance of "winning."  This is primarily
because everyone is afraid to ask.

One sociologist notes that "the most important sociological function of
computers is to keep programmers off the streets."

Chemical engineers, with their suicidal passion for toxicity, have managed
to replace most of the fundamental elements of our daily life with synthetic
counterparts which, if not carcinogenic to begin with, release poisonous
fumes if heated above 82 degrees Fahrenheit.  Even such fundamentals as wood
and cloth are privileged to treatments with such deceivingly innocent names
as "Nu-Glo" or "stain-gard"."  This procedure is in actuality a humane effort
to insure that fire victims don't suffer much.

Mechanical engineers are often mistakenly considered more traditional and
rational than most.  A quick trip to Detroit quickly shatters this fragile
illusion.  Many a backyard mechanic has marveled at the overwhelming variety
of extraneous and unfathomable parts in his own vehicle, none of which are
interchangeable with last year's, let alone a different model.  Most do-it-
yourselfers live by 3 basic rules:

        1) If you don't recognize it, you can probably do without it.
        2) If it's over 20 dollars, it can be replaced with baling wire.
        3) Any new car's fuel efficiency can be increased at least 38%
           by removing everything that's not on the 1968 model.

Another frightening concept is introduced here "planned obsolescence".  This
is a technical term which means you spend extra time and money to design
something badly so that it will break pretty soon (1 to 5 days after the
warranty expires).  This is related to destructive testing and crash testing;
essentially, these people like to break things.

I hope you have enjoyed this article.  I also hope that, twenty years from
now, you'll sit back and think to yourself:  "What did I design today?"

================================================================================

As a postscript to this, I am the "J. Diewald" being poked fun at in the
article.  In one of those strange cosmic coincidences, I received this
message while in the process of alphabetizing the debugger error message file
for easier reading.  "Johnson" always has been a little spooky that way.

I hope you like "Changing Places" as much as I did.  I've read every
David Lodge book I can get my hands on.  They're not all as good as
"Changing Places", but they've been worth reading.  If you like
"Changing Places", I recommend "Small World".  It is a little bit of a
sequel in that some of the same characters appear, but it's actually
quite different, and very funny.

That's one hell of an aggressive spelling checker you've got there.
Interesting that its word list includes "Abraham" and "Ulysses" but
not about "George".  I wonder if it knows "Aristotle" and "Isaac".
But why "Harry" and "Franklin" if not "George" and "John"?  Oh, maybe
it just couldn't find any words that were even remotely close to
"Ulysses" and it's not infinitely aggressive.  (And it thinks of
"whelm" as a word?)

I tried to compile the C program on the Sun.  "signed char" is not
supported; the "#define" has to be at the beginning of the line; "1s"
for a short constant 1 is not accepted; then it compiled, but it died
at runtime, apparently confused by the mixing of char constants with
integer variables or something.  Oh, well.

Anyway, I'm writing you because someone in an earlier Desperado said
that I said in an even earlier Desperado that "lingerie" is not a
French word.  If I did say that, I misspoke myself.  Here is the
complete story on "lingerie" according to the book "There is no Zoo in
Zoology", by Charles Harrington Eister:

"Lingerie", which came into English from French in the nineteenth
century, has been so mangled by English speakers that it is now almost
impossible to pronounce it correctly and be understood.  Words taken
into English from other languages, if they occur frequently in speech,
soon become anglicized in pronunciation.  This is natural and
appropriate.  With "lingerie", however, the process of anglicization
has backfired and resulted in an inept and ludicrous imitation of the
original French.  The pronunciations popular today bear no resemblance
to the French, nor do they sound like English.  It would be kind but
inaccurate to call them anglicizations.  They are best described as
"manglicizations."

The French is lanzh-REE, and until about fifty years ago it was the
only pronunciation countenanced in cultivated speech.  Then all manner
of permutations began to appear in the dictionaries.  Webster 2 (1934)
gives lanzh-REE, but adds "popularly, LAHN-zhe'-ree."  Kenyon and
Knott (1949) prefer LAN-zhe'-ree, as does the Winston Dictionary
(1951); the American College (1953), however, puts lahn-zhe'-RAY first
and LAN-zhe'ree second.  Finally, Webster 3 (1961) covers all the
bases by placing lahn-je'-RAY at the head of a long series of variants
followed by the admonition that vowels other than short A (as in
"land") in the first syllable and long E (as in "reed") in the last
syllable are regarded by many as substandard.  So who said the
dictionary was the place to go for a little straightforward advice?

In the 1959 film "Anatomy of a Murder," in which a certain pair of
panties figures prominently as evidence in a trial, Jimmy Stewart and
George C. Scott both say lahn-zhe'-ree, their stress varying from the
first to third syllable.  This pronunciation, recorded in Webster 2
(1934), still appears in most current dictionaries.  Though it is a
hybrid, it is preferable to the variants ending in -RAY because it at
least properly anglicizes the final vowels "-ie" to conform with
"reverie", "coterie", "bourgeoisie", "jalousie", and other analogous
words.

The preferred pronunciations, LAN-zhe-ree and lan-zhe-REE, are the
most faithful to the original vowel sounds of the French, and they are
still listed in several current dictionaries.  (One handbook -- the
"NBC Handbook" -- prefers LAH-zhe-ree.)  Unfortunately, they are now
incomprehensible to most Americans.  I offer them here, not with any
false hope that they will catch on, only to bring light to a bit of
bungled pretentiousness that somehow became the norm.

The funny thing about all this confusion is that "lingerie", when you
think about it, is a pretty silly word -- a euphemism we have adopted
to make something intimate and titillating sound innocuous at social
gatherings and over department store loudspeakers.  In "Anatomy of a
Murder," the judge asks counselors Stewart and Scott if there is an
Anglo-Saxon word they can use in place of "lingerie" to make the
testimony clearer and more specific.  When Stewart slyly suggests
"panties," the jury snickers, but the judge, realizing that panties
are precisely what they are talking about, prudently lectures the
jurors to keep their prurient connotations out of his courtroom.
Since blank or puzzled faces usually meet my attempts to pronounce
"lingerie" properly, and since I cannot bring myself to "manglicize"
the word, these days, whenever I am about to utter it I say "women's
underwear" instead -- a plain English phrase that gets the point
across just fine.

Subj:   Squonk?

I'm reminded of the Genesis song "Squonk", written in 1975, and
appearing on their LP "A Trick of the Tail".   It goes, well, a little
something like this...

Squonk
------
Like father, like son
Not flesh nor fish nor bone
A red rag hangs from an open mouth
Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle
A-tumbling and a-bumbling he will go
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Could never put a smile on that face

He's a sly he's a shy one
Wouldn't you be, too?
Scared to be left out on his own
Hasn't a, hasn't a friend to play with, the Ugly Duckling
The pressure on, the bubble will burst before our eyes
All the while in perfect time
His tears are falling on the ground
BUT IF YOU DON'T STAND UP YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

Go a little faster now, you might get there in time.

Mirror mirror on the wall
His heart was broken long before he ever came to you
Stop your tears from falling
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night
                                   for all to see at night

In season, out of season
What's the difference when you don't know the reason?
In one hand bread, the other a stone
The hunter enters the forest
All are not hunstmen who can blow the huntsman's horn
By the look of this one, you've not got much to fear

Here I am, I'm very fierce and frightening
I've come to match my skill to yours
Now listen here, listen to me, don'tcha run away now
I am a friend, I'd really like to play with you
Making noises my little furry friend would make
I'll trick him, then I'll kick him into my sack
(You better watch out, you better watch out!)

I've got you, I've got you, you'll never get away

Walking home that night
The sack across my back, the sound of sobbing on my shoulder
When suddenly it stopped
I opened up the sack, all that I had
A pool of bubbles and tears -- JUST A POOL OF TEARS.

All in all, you are a very dying race
Placing trust upon a cruel world
You never had the things you thought you should have had
And you'll not get them now
And all the while in perfect time -
Your tears are falling on the ground.

        "The Squonk is of a very retiring disposition, and due to its
        ugliness, weeps constantly.  It is easy prey for hunters who
        simply follow a tear-stained trail.  When cornered, it will
        dissolve itself into tears.

I've always felt that there are 3 ways to deal with the
wackos who post bizarre and incorrect audio information,
especially about digital audio:

1-  Ignore them and chuckle
2-  Try to patiently explain things
3-  Set up a company and make money - lots of money

I have been jumping between 1 and 2, but now have decided
that number 3 is for me.

I am proposing formation of a company.  Anyone out there
is welcome to join me.  I am pretty sure there are plenty
of potential customers.  I suggest the name-
Sonically Corrected Audio Machinery (SCAM).

Some offerings from our first catalog:

*** The environment chamber
As the CD spins, the audio information is read by
a low powered laser beam and then sent to the electronics
of the CD player.  This means that the sound from the disc
is actually TRAVELLING THROUGH THIS AIR GAP!  The
properties of sound propagation in air are understood by
scientists, but are ignored by CD player designers.
The result is sound that is colored by the composition,
temperature and humidity of the air in the room.  On
humid days, the player will have a "stuffy" sound, while
on a dry winter day the highs will be more "crisp".  Dust
and humidity can muddy the sound.  Furthermore, the air
is not optimal for transmission of laser light.  Under
some conditions, the air may become "resonant" at the laser
frequency and cause errors.  Our solution is the CD
environment chamber- a chamber which surrounds the CD
player with an environment of dry, temperature controlled
compressed nitrogen.  The user may vary the temperature
to make the sound warmer.  Several other knobs are provided
which the user may adjust.

*** The data magnet
Many CD player sound problems are traced to problems in
"the bits coming off the disc".  Our research has found
that in many cases, the bits actually do not leave the
CD, but remain attached to it.  To correct this, we have
developed the "data magnet".  This electromagnet is placed
so that it "pulls" each bit toward the laser, so that it
may be easily "picked up".  This results in less drain
on the laser power supply, since it is obviously doing
less work to gather the data.  The magnet is excited
by an analog power supply, which imparts the subtle
burblishness to the sound that analog is known for.

*** The green lamp
Recent articles in the audio press have explained the
benefits of using a green marker to treat the edges of
CDs.  The scientific basis for this breakthrough has
been discovered by our researchers.  It is not the edging,
but the green light hitting the disc which improves the
sound.  Many researchers have failed to duplicate the
effect in thier labs because they colored the disc then
immediately put it into a player, without letting it expose
in the ambient light.  Our discovery is that the bits on
a CD are "developed" by exposure to certain wavelengths
of light.  The raw CD has a "negative" quality to it,
until developed.  The principle is similar to glow-in-the-
dark toys that must be held under light to glow.  Of
course, only a little light exposure is provided by green
edges (but even this small amount has been reported to
help).  You can't color the face of the CD green.  So
we have developed the special "green lamp" which bathes
the CD in an intense beam of green light.  Each CD
should be "charged" in this light before playing, so that
the music will project a warm, developed glow.
NOTE:  for use on ordinary CDs only-- gold CDs require a
different color of light, available soon.

It had to happen.  Until recently, the toaster was one of the few household
appliances left that was not digitalized, computerized or high-teched.  Now
there's a programmable toaster that knows the difference between a bagel,
croissant, English muffin and slice of bread and toasts them accordingly,
says the manufacturer, St. Gallen.

There are three toasting buttons that allow custom settings.  So if Aunt
Jean comes for breakfast and she likes her bagel toasted lightly, you can
program that information into the unit.

The toaster beeps as it raises the bread and defrosts frozen waffles
without burning.  With a price tag of $129, this is strictly for the gadget
lover.  Order through Chef's Catalog, 1-800-338-3232.

        An Analytic Study of the Least Publishable Increment

                            Abstract

        This paper presents an analytic study of the least
        publishable increment (LPI).  The LPI is defined as
        the smallest acceptable difference between two
        publishable papers.  Two metrics for the LPI are derived.
        The first metric is based on a generalized distance
        measure derived from the Hausdorf metric and is used to
        differentiate between papers on similar topics by
        different authors.  The second metric describes a
        distance measure for papers from the same author.

        Further studies using cross-journal and conference
        proceedings relations are also discussed.  We outline a
        simple strategy for maximal publication based on these
        distance measures.  An illustrative example of the
        maximal publication scheme is shown and its correlation
        to actual publications is also given.

        We present a proof that maximal publication based on
        the LPI is an optimal approach for junior faculty members
        attempting to get tenure.

Subject: What to do with a NeXT Computer
Organization: SERC, Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue Univ.
From: Gene Spafford &lt;spaf@cs.purdue.edu&gt;

&gt;From the April 1 Issue of U-M Computing, the newsletter of the
University of Michigan Information Technology Division

The NeXT Computer: A Tool to Study Artificial Intelligence
- ----------------------------------------------------------
As more and more NeXT computers are introduced to campus, it has
become possible for artificially intelligent scientists at U-M to
extend the milestone research reported by Bennett at Yale University.
[1] Bennett's study used a computer simulation to test the notion that
if enough monkeys were allowed to pound at typewriters long enough,
all the great works of literature would result. This early research
suffered from two limitations. The first was a reliance upon random
number generation to choose characters on the typewriter. The second
was the ability to compare the output only with statistical properties
of the English language.

Current research at U-M attempts the ultimate experiment to test
Bennett's notion. Since November 1988, groups of primates have spent
their evenings and weekends in the various computer laboratories
across campus that house NeXT computers. A total of 24 monkeys are
currently serving as subjects in this research. The procedure is
straightforward. During each laboratory session, the monkeys are
anchored by seat belts in front of the NeXT keyboards. To encourage
typing, the keys are laced with honey to attract the monkeys'
attention. Each keystroke made is stored in sequence in the monkey's
personal text file. After every thirteenth keystroke, the monkey is
rewarded with a grape. After every two hundred keystrokes, the
positive reinforcement is increased to a banana, suggested by the work
of Feldman and Sprout.[2]

The U-M experiment improves upon the previous research in two ways.
First, the typed productions are not a gamble, a la Monte Carlo.
Instead, they are produced by actual, living monkeys. Second, and more
importantly, the typed productions are compared directly with the
actual works of Shakespeare, which are readily available for searching
in the NeXT computers' optical discs. The monkeys' text is divided
into packets of 13 characters, ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation.
The content of these packets provides the input for a search of the
Shakespeare file. All matches are then transferred to a new NeXT text
file for the monkey, which includes date, time, and Shakespearean
citation.

The original research on the monkey problem, relying on probabilistic
expectation, would readily pick up string matches such as "he is," but
the NeXT capacity allows for matching patterns of the rarity of
"putter; your pelly is all putter," which, with its alliterative
property, has a high probability for primate production.

The research to date has proved more fruitful than the 1977 simulation
study. For example, a twice-observed match from two different monkeys
was "what dole of honour flies where you bid it," an obvious reference
to bananas, both by brand and attribution. As was recently pointed out
in an electronic conference on MTS, "time flies like an arrow; fruit
flies like a banana."

The self-referential quality of many of the primate productions in
this research is a serendipitous finding of far great- er importance
than the mere production of Shakespearean passages. For example, "like
a geminy of baboons" was one of the matches. "When next we meet" was
also produced. Another monkey behavior, "itch from head to foot," was
observed, both in practice and in the typed text. Perhaps indicative
of the difficulty of the experimental task, one poor primate produced
"written troubles of the brain," while another gave forth "they speak
no English." These results show that the research problem is much more
complex than the mere ability of the monkeys to reproduce Shakespeare
by rote. Innate knowledge and literature appreciation must also be
studied.

There is no doubt that without the NeXT computer, research of this
caliber would be impossible. The results to date of the study are
indeed among "April's first-born flowers, and all things rare."
Although the current research has shown many instances (N=978, p=.07)
of ability to produce portions of the works of Shakespeare, it will
take many more years of intensive study to determine how much time is
enough time to reproduce all of Shakespeare.  The research will
continue as long as funds for the care and feeding of the research
subjects are available.

[I think GUI means generic user interface.]

Dear Editor:

GUIs are billed by their advocates as being intuitive and culture-free;
however, they are neither.  The design of windowing systems depends very
heavily on the user reading from top to bottom and left to right, which can
be very misleading to people not used to reading in this manner.

The late Henry Dreyfus, an industrial designer who spent the last years of
his life working with graphics for labeling machinery controls and other
industrial uses, collected stories about misreading signs across cultures.
My favorite was a broken wine glass as the symbol for fragile cargo, which
you still see today.  This was consistently read as "damaged cargo" in South
America, and the cartons were thrown out as salvage by the dock workers.  The
current preferred symbol is an unbroken wine glass.

Several of my coworkers came back from a Sybase users meting with a new
vocabulary of oddball icons for the Sun workstation.  They included a stencil
outline of an airplane taking off for "system coming up" and one landing with
wheels down for "system coming down."  I suggested the gruesome but obvious
stencil of pieces of an airplane bouncing off the runway for a system crash,
perhaps with little bodies flying out of the plane to show how many tasks
were active at the time of the crash.

Technology is not talent.  Flash and dazzle are not function and design.  It
was thoughtful of Tonkin to remind us.

Upon crashing, the Plato system at the University of Illinois used to
broadcast a little graphic of an airplane spiralling down and smashing.

I took a course in graphic interfaces taught by one of the founders of and
biggest names in the whole field.  He had been commissioned to do the
graphics for a "Pacific Basin Conference on Food and Nutrition" held in
Honolulu.  In the Pacific Basin they eat lots of ways, with their hands,
with chopsticks, out of bowls, out of leaves, out of hollowed-out pieces of
bread, but the icon designed by this expert for "meal" was a round plate
with a fork to the left and a knife and spoon to the right.

On the other hand, he did warn us that there were cultures where the men
wore skirts and the women wore pants, thus playing hob with international
restroom symbology.

Subj:   Desperado #3033: A slim young mother

    Following are some haiku, appropriate to this season, translated from
    Japanese by R.H. Blyth (further citation on request) that do not, of
    course, obey the syllabic rules now that they have been translated.

The translation of these is fairly liberal; the
translations even change the order of the lines!
Clearly, he's translating the "look and feel".

Anyway, to really appreciate these, I think it helps
to understand that the Japanese word for "fireworks"
is constructed of the Chinese characters for "flower"
and "fire".  (i.e. "hana" + "hi" = "hanabi").

The first line of the first haiku uses the word "flower",
even though that doesn't appear in the translation here.

I think the contrast between the liberal and literal
translations would be very interesting.  The mood of
the literal is much more of a still life; often eschewing
verbs.  The crystal minimalism is sadly lost in most
translations, because it sounds unnatural to English
ears.  But the more liberal translation gives him space
to put back some nuances which are implied in the original.

I guess I'll take a stab at the first one, since the
only thing I can't figure out, I don't understand in
the translation, either.  "pennorth" = "penn'worth" =
"penny's worth"?

En hana ya nimon hanabi no yoru no tei

Ni-mon hanabi is two "mons" worth of fireworks. A "mon" is one-hundredth
of a "hyakume". A hyakume is five-sixths of a pound. I have no idea what the
hell a pound is doing in there.

Anyway, the character for "mon" is a very common one, it's also "bun", as in
"bunka" meaning culture, "bumpo" meaning grammar, or "Bunraku", the famous
puppet theatre.

The mon kanji is almost simple enough to draw, even in mail (flying without
a net!).

Subj:   Desperado: The Scourge of Voice Mail

The Scourge of Voice Mail
     by Jon Carroll

[Snarfed without permission from the SF Chronicle]

Sit with me now as I attempt to communicate telephonically with the
office of East Bay Wickbraiders.  I wish to ask East Bay Wickbraiders
the mailing address of their warehouse in Yolo County.  Ring ring ring.
Click.

"Our operator is busy right now."  Easy Bay Wickbraiders has seven
full-time employees.  None of them is an operator.  The person who
answered the phones was fired last year.  The miracle of voice mail.

"If you know the extension of the person you are trying to reach, dial
the extension now."  Actually, anyone there probably knows the
information.  Unfortunately, I don't know any extension numbers.

"if you know the name of the person you are trying to reach, press the
first three letters of his or her last name."  I know the name of one
person; the president of the company.  He probably doesn't want to handle
this stuff directly, but I have few options.

I am at least lucky that I have an old-style nondesigner phone that
includes letters.  I press the right buttons.

"I'm sorry," says a woman's voice, "but James Wickbraider has stepped
away from his desk.  Please leave a message of any length at the sound
of the tone."  I start to leave a message that is not perhaps in the
best of taste.  Halfway through, the machine coughs up a dial tone.

I have been kicked out the back door without even catching the scent of
an actual human being.  This is the '90s, where we invent machines to
reduce human contact and then complain about urban isolation.

Remember when people answered telephones?  Real smart people who
actually knew something about the company and , if you called more than
a few times, knew your name and the probable nature of your business?

People who answered telephones always new the address of the warehouse
in Yolo county.  They knew whether Jim had just gone downstairs to buy a
candy bar or was on his way to Cleveland.  They knew when everyone was
at a party in accounting.

These people also understood how the company worked.  Think of that.
They knew that Jennifer was handling shipping complaints, or that Fred
had been transferred to New Mexico.  They could cool simmering tempers,
make helpful suggestions, even provide useful information to their
employers.

Voice mail doesn't do that; voice mail is profoundly dumb.  It says to
the customer: Hey, get a life.  We're important and you're not.  It
instantly engages you in a battle for control and then beats you to a
pulp.

Plus, it saves money!  Now you can lose valuable customers at a fraction
of the cost!

Lately, I have been soliciting nominations for the very worst voice-mail
systems.  Fortunately, the Chronicle's is pretty benign; if the person
you're trying to reach isn't there, you are able to talk to an actual
human being.

Unfortunately, this human being is called "the attendant."  Kind of a
weird hospital vibe, as though the city room were patrolled by people in
long white coats brandishing restraining straps.  That's true, of
course, by efforts are made to keep this information from the public.

The bottom of the barrel so far is the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.  Seven bumps (press one; press 3; press 6), then an
announcement that you must listen to one of 11 speeches before reaching
a real person.  There is no short-circuit; one speech per phone call, no
exceptions.

For huddled masses yearning to breathe free, press 5.
