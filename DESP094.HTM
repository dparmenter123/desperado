Subject: A PARA-OPERATIC ROUSER

You know me, you know I'd look for somebody to include some opera in the
music mix, and I know you-all, and I know nobody would. So here's the only
one I can honestly recommend to people who say they don't like opera but
would if they could be jumpstarted! It's the Maria Callas/Giuseppe di Stefano
Carmen, and what  I'd recommend is the highlights album on Angel -- just the
arias, really, but you can listen to those all day and all night and dance
to them too! Callas was in the later stages of her mezzo at that point, and
she sounds like she's singing with a rose in her teeth, but the raw power
will blast you out of your socks.

The para-operatic rouser I speak of is that delicious schlock Carmina
Burana, a large collection of dirty medieval student songs, which is the
way to get somebody started listening to choral music! You can't sit
down while listening to this one either, between the rhythms, the lyrics,
and the vocal pyrotechnics. The performance I'd recommend is Rafael
Fruhbeck de Burgos' Angel recording with Lucia Popp. It's an old record,
but still in print. Maybe even on Seraphim now, which would be a plus.

Yours for La Voix Humaine (little operatic pun there...)

Scott Joplin, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Grover Washington, Jr.,
Ella Fitzgerald.

Less mass-appeal but worth it:  Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin,
Stevie Wonder (BEST BET), The Drifters, Toots and the Maytals.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I lied  when I said nobody had mentioned Stevie Wonder.  He and Scott
Joplin are the exact sort of music I had in mind, unpredictable but
exactly right and always fresh.  I once listened to thirty renditions
of "Maple Leaf Rag" by all sorts of piano players, bands, and combos
and it was still appealing at the end.  My younger son (not the
Deadhead) spent most of a year working up a piano suite based on the
music from "South Pacific" and I never got tired of that either.  I
love the Rolling Stones but I don't know if they qualify for this
contest. The next entry is another perfect example.

My vote goes to a band called The Dregs (previously known as the Dixie
Dregs). These guys are so eclectic they defy catagorization.  On any
one album you're likely to find, rock, jazz, classical, country, funk,
and types of music you never even heard before.

There is a set of albums I recently came across by George Wilson, consisting
of original piano pieces, plus a few he didn't write.  His playing is
remarkably crisp and very original.  I hear something new each time.  The
albums I know about are titled "December" and "Winter into Spring."  I know
you can get them at the Coop in Cambridge.

Some more ideas from my musical grab bag:

1.  Jean-Michel Jarre - exciting and not too farout synthetic things, notably
    his albums "Oxygene" and "Les Chants Magnetiques", the latter of which is
    sold in the USA as "Magnetic Fields", which makes no sense whatever.

2.  Debussy.  Piano music.  Almost any of it, but especially "Reverie", "The
    Girl with the Flaxen Hair", and "The Engulfed Cathedral" - various of
    his piano works have been transcribed for orchestra, usually successfully.

3.  Something from Broadway - howzabout "Oklahoma!", the 1943 original;
    "Kismet" or "Kean" or "Kiss me Kate", the Alfred Drake versions, "South
    Pacific"; "Camelot"!!!; "Hello, Dolly".

4.  Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Glen Gray (!), Duke Ellington.

5.  The Kingston Trio.  Peter, Paul and Mary.

6.  Assorted Pops classics, e.g., Danse Macabre, Finlandia, Ritual Fire Dance,
    Bartered Bride Overture, Kabalevsky's Comedians' Galop, Sabre Dance, The
    Three Cornered Hat Dances, Carnival of the Animals, Enescu's Romanian
    Rhapsody, etc., ad infinitum.

Subject: music &amp; tangentially relevant to music

I could listen to the Baroque Beatles' Book forever and also Switched On
Bach.  I recommend Theo Bikel (any Album) but after the fifth repitition I
do tend to want something else.  Songs of the Humpback Whale and The Earth's
Magnetic Field are interesting once in a while.

That should calibrate the scale for what I like to listen to!

I think John Williams is excellent (and in the tradition of Baroque and
Classical composers he writes to order for money - What did you THINK Bach
and Mozart were doing, eh?)

I'm interested in people's recommendations for current pop groups.
Most of them I find musically uninteresting and I don't have the patience
to wade through the chaff for the occasional grain of wheat.  If I want
decibels, I prefer bagpipes, steam caliopes, trinidad steel drums or
pipe organs.  Can some country and western afficionado tell me who is
doing interesting stuff on the steel guitar?  Back in the 50's I used to
watch a Western orchestra show just to hear their steel guitar soloist
(and see what theui female impersonator would say - I had never seen one
before at that point and found the idea incredible, I wasn't 12 yet and
was still hoping I could manage to kiss my elbow so I would have permission
to become a "real human being" instead of "a mommy" - lack of permission
didn't stop me but did make it harder...)

Let me recommend Handel's music for the Royal Fire Works.  I prefer it to
the Water Music.

Schubert's Gesang Des Geister uber den Wassern  is the best piece of
choral music for non-lovers of choral music.  It describes the cycle of
rain, to rivers, to lakes, to the sea, to cloud formation.  As such it
has some nice exciting parts as the water rushes down the mountain.  The
musical mimicry of weather even manages to make the religious analogy
palatable.  You can ignore the meaning of the words, since they are
taken from a poem and sound good, and are in German so the meaning won't
intrude on you if you don't want it to.

Offenbach's Barcarolle from The Tales of Hoffman, I recommend as an
operatic aria for non-lovers of opera.  As added encouragement, let me
mention that it is a song about sex, and a proper rendition of it (in
the original language) will be in French.  Not that it is explicit,
only enthusiastically anticipatory.

Someone must have mentioned Bach's Tocatta and Fugue? (You know, the first
piece in Fantasia - I prefer the original organ version but any one is good.)
Actually all the pieces in Fantasia represent the list of recommended classical
pieces for non-lovers of classical music developed by Walt Disney and Leopold
Stowkowski.  They did such a perfect job that I can't hear the Nutcracker
Suite without thinking of the dancing mushrooms or Beethoven's Pastorale
without thinking about the winged horses.  The one with the hippopotamus and
the alligators is Dance of the Hours by Ponchielli.

And finally:

"...Baroque music increases concentration by reducing stress and fatigue in
the listener.  Insight: A composed mind absorbs information about two and
one-half times faster than one blocked by anxiety.  The Baroque rhythm of
about one beat per second seems to be just right for setting the mind at
ease.  Upshot: When you need to concentrate, play the music of Vivaldi,
Bach or Handel. "

This is less strange if you remember that most Baroque music was written
to be background music at the courts of Europe, to soothe the monarchs
and their attendant ministers and diplomats while they were carrying on
the business of state (or worrying about it).

My recommendations for music that never pales would include anything by J. S.
Bach and anything by jazzes' Bach, Duke Ellington. Two jazz performers whose
work I always enjoy are saxophonist Ben Webster and pianist Bill Evans. One
particular selection that I never get tired of is Benny Goodman's 1938 Carnegie
Hall version of "Sing, Sing, Sing."

And now for some answers, or at least some more music suggestions.  My first
thoughts were the pieces that I would pick if I were to be stranded on a
desert island and had only a few recordings that I could take with me.
The Beethoven 9th symphony.  The Bach B-Minor Mass.  Brahms Requiem.
Mozart's Magic Flute.  But, they're probably inappropriate, as they are all
sit-down-and-pay-attention-to-it music.  They are also expensive, and could
use up one's entire record budget.  And, though *I* can listen to these
pieces over and over, perhaps not everyone can.  So here are some of my
candidates for music that can bear repeated listening.

Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (either the original piano or the
  Ravel orchestration)

Handel's Messiah, (maybe Highlights therefrom.  It'll be a little less
  expensive that way)

Mozart's 41st. Symphony.

Bach's Brandenburg Concertos.  All of 'em (they're all good)

Debussy Nocturnes (or La Mer, if you must, but I'm tired of that by now)

The Kings Singers and the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble have lots of good
  records out.  I would think that any of the King's Singers albums except for
  the "Contemporary Collection" would be appropriate (even though that is my
  favorite of all of their works).  I don't have a specific recommendation for
  the Philip Jones Ensemble; they have millions of records on the market, too,
  and the two I own are very good.

Some non-classical suggestions: Dave Brubeck?  Peter, Paul, and Mary?  The
suggestions of  ethnic folk and dance music (I'm partial to British/Irish/
Scottish/Welsh music, myself) are good ideas that didn't occur to me.  I've
listened to West Side Story repeatedly and I still love that show.

I agree, too, with the suggestion to obtain a copy of "The Point".  It has a
charming story, which is told on the record (it isn't just the songs from
the film), and would appeal to anyone who likes to listen to stories.  I
think it would be also a good story for kids/retarded adults to sing and act
out (the sheet music is, or at least was, available.  By some miracle, I
have both the album and the music, so I know that at some time somewhere the
stuff was published.  I would be happy to dig it out and get the name of the
publisher if someone would like it).

Judgements on what is listenable are about as subjective as you can get,

        Beatles: All albums, esp. Rubber Soul and Revolver

        The Band: Music from Big Pink

        Van Morrison: Moondance

        Squeeze: East Side Story (a few songs aren't as universally listenable
                 as as others but it's a great album anyway)

        Elvis Costello: My Aim is True (I realize that my objectivity may
                        may be doubted by some, but who cares?)

There is a GREAT anthology of the Kinks' middle period called the "Kink
Kronicles".  It is a double album that was released when the Kinks had
just left the Reprise record label.  It contains some of the best Davies'
compositions including "Lola", "Waterloo Sunset", "Dead End Street", "Sunny
Afternoon", "Victoria", and many others.  Truly one of the most underrated
rock goups in modern rock ... blah, blah ... [end of flame].

I'm not sure my first thought would be Beethoven, for crowd-pleasing.  If I
did want some Lud output, I think I'd avoid symphonic work (except maybe the
"Emperor" piano concerto) in favor of a couple of mixed sonatas like the
"Waldstein" (exciting and dazzling) and the "Moonlight" (too beautiful to be
spoiled by overfamiliarity); the "Hammerklavier" is my favorite but a little
inaccessible, musically speaking.  Some middle quartets might serve, too.

Mozart, on the other hand, tends to sound good to anyone who hears it.  I need
a Mozart buff to make recommendations, beyond of course the clarinet quintet,
which is musically ideal but maybe too familiar lately (its 1st movement, for
example, was what Charles tried to teach his Chinese POWs in the last MASH).

Speaking of overfamiliarity, THINK TWICE about that Pachelbel canon.  It
really got done to death, to the point where New Yorker cartoons poked fun at
it.  It's not THAT good a piece, after all.  The same kind of musical effect
is much better done in Bach's famous "Air for the G-string" (not THAT kind of
G-string, jokers) which I believe is part of a suite or concerto which I don't
remember, and is also very well done on the first Walter Carlos synthesizer
record ("Switched-On Bach") which my wife finds astonishingly effective with
young high-schoolers who wouldn't listen to anything else except rock.

You MUST have some Bach.  Period.  People think he takes a lot of getting used
to, and unfortunately that's true of some of the best stuff.  Yehudi Menuhin
and friends (Bath Festival Orch, I think) put out an Angel or Seraphim record
of the "Musical Offering" which has some lovely stuff pretty easy to get into.
I'm trying to avoid choral music suggestions, because it doesn't seem to have
such wide appeal, but it should be noted that Bach's B minor Mass and the St.
Matthew Passion are the best and the second-best choral works ever, not
necessarily in that order.  Both can be found in one-disc excerpt format,
which is the ONLY way to present the Passion to unsophisticated listeners.

Brahms and the much-maligned Tchaikovsky share a useful characteristic for
first-time listeners, which is that they lean on melody and orchestral color.

If you want to include 20th century stuff, which is ticklish, go with Bartok's
String Quartet #1.  It's addictively beautiful, not THAT hard to appreciate,
and leads the listener automatically thru more than one modern-music doorway.
In particular DON'T use just anything by Copland!  The various ballet suites?
--Fine.  Statements for Orchestra, or Piano Variations? --They won't like it.

Want an off-the-wall suggestion (if you really can tolerate choral music)?
Heinrich Schutz.  Psalm #84, if available; I have a really nice (and cheap)
Nonesuch record of motets from his Cantiones Sacrae; its jacket is turquoise.

Jazz: a Dave Brubeck record including "Take Five" would be well-received; I
like anything by Thelonius Monk, who tends to be melodious; Coltrane is
exciting but probably hard to get into.  Charlie Byrd always sounds good, and
is often (but not always) inventive: a particularly good choice would be his
Jobim stuff -- I think there's a "Brazilian Byrd" album -- which is easy to
listen to and would also help to broaden their cultural horizons.

Yes, anything Beatles -- but especially Rubber Soul, I now think.

Roberta Flack's "Best Of" album, whatever it's called, is a real winner.
So, for that matter, is (Mama) Cass Elliot's.

             pianist.  (I believe this is the one Aitel  was  trying  to
             remember.   Bolling  did  a number of albums like this, but
             the "Suite" was the first and is still the best.)

          o  Pat Metheny - American Garage;  As Falls Wichita, So  Falls
             Wichita Falls.

         Pop, Rock, Misc.:

          o  The Animals - The Best of the Animals.

          o  Jimmy Buffet - Changes In Latitudes-Changes in  Attitudes.

          o  Elvis Costello - My Aim Is True (first album);  This  Years
             Model;  Armed Forces.

          o  Gordon Lightfoot - Gordon Lightfoot (first album).

          o  Harry Nilsson - The Point.

          o  Queen - (I can't help it!  I like  Queen,  at  least  their
             older  albums  such  as:) Night at the Opera;  News of the
             World.

The Pat Metheny Group with Lyle Mayes on piano represents a superfine
listening experience that I would recommend to anyone.

Remember, this is all gonna get boiled down to a list of twenty-five
albums.  (I just cut more than that out of HYDRA::MIDDLETON's
contribution immediately above.)

There were "Independence" ceremonies in Grenada earlier this week.  We
celebrated their "independence" by precision dropping a company of
paratroopers flown in from Fort Bragg on the ceremony.  "Independence
seems to vanish in the haze," as John Lennon said.
