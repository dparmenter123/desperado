Thanks to Desperados for your patience on receiving multimails, and
thanks for telling me when you got them.  The story is that the new RSX
mail under test detects weak nodes on the net and sends them tons of
mail to prove how weak they are.  That is, if you get extra copies, it
is at least likely that the problem is with the net and not with RSX
mail.  If you get multiple Desperados, please inform me, CASTOR::COVERT,
your system manager, and your network guru, and we'll try to work it
out.

Just for the record, the first time I heard the Summer song, I was watching
the Tonight Show (this was at least 17 years ago, as there are subsequent
events that I can date).  The guest was Jerry Lewis, the comedian, and the
subject was memory.  Seems Jerry has a rather phenomenal memory, and the
host (probably but not certainly Johnny) put him to the test by leading him
through a recitation of the list wherein host would give one line and Jerry
had to recite that line preceded by all that had gone before.  Then host
would give the next line, etc.  Jerry did it correctly the first time.  I
was impressed.  I had never heard or seen the list since then except when I
used it for a game similar to the one I witnessed, until it shew (show, shew,
shown?) up in DESPERADO.  "Recherche de temps perdu" indeed!

From Sales Update Vol. 14 No.14, p. 56 -

        [To be included in the Digital Classified Software Program]
        a product may serve any market or application, except those
        involving high-risk applications (such as nuclear reactor
        control), applications with a potential for personal injury
        or applications that are not in the public interest.

How would you like to be in charge of identifying applications 'not in the
public interest'?  Thus, must mailing list programs automatically terminate
if used to raise funds for (pick one only:) &lt;right/left&gt; wing political
causes and &lt;pro/anti&gt; gun control lobbying?

I also quite like the idea of the idea of a nuclear reactor control
program running on a Robin, or other DEC personal computer.  Finally,
would 'potential for personal injury' rule out, for example, a stock
selection program?

Subject: Collective nouns

In "Usage and Abusage" Eric Partridge lists about a couple of hundred
of collectives, and not only these but other field sport terms. They
are found under the heading SPORTS (field sport) TECHNICALITIES. I
quote from his introduction:

 "There are, in field sports, numerous terms that baffle or are
unknown to the ordinary man and woman. The best book I know on the
subject is Major C. E. Hare's "The Language of Sport".

"From Major Hare's invaluable work, to which I refer the laudably
curious reader, I select a few groups:

        animals' footmarks
        retirement to rest
        cries
        tails
        the marks on horses
        company (or Group) nouns

Some examples below, but first...

Once, somewhere on 5-2, I overheard someone asking where somebody or
other could be found. The directions were to go down to the next (get
ready now):

        ==&gt; BAY OF SECRETARIES &lt;==

of which are more inventive [and humorous] than the ones listed below.

I found the ultimate how-to book (and it's fun to read):

        Nonsense How to Overcome It  (absence of : intentional, i think)

Robert J. Gula wrote it (a real preppie who "holds the Independence
Foundation Chair at the Groton School")

I suspect it wants to be a popularized introduction to logic, but what it
is is funny and true (and full of "oh my god someone's onto my tricks...")

One of the best things in it is an appendix titled:  Summary of Fallacies
and Nonsense.  That's a chapter by chapter list of the fallacies and
nonsense he's described in the book.  For example, Chapter 5, Propaganda,
includes:

Having finally gotten around to reading the latest DESPERADO readings, I
was just a bit suprised at the reaction to the idea of a gathering of
DESPERADI.  I hadn't planned on it, but what the heck!  I'm game (at least,
I've been accused of it) for the idea.  Being somewhat outside Greater

such an event are somewhat restricted, but hopefully I'll be spending the

1. Dictionaries

   I vote for either Webster's New Collegiate or Third International.  I
   had an English professor at UMass/Amherst who was moonlighting at
   Merriam-Webster's collecting for the International (my apologies to
   Mike Harvey; I told him it was the other one) the various ways people
   use various words.  She said it was going to be the best Webster's
   ever.  Miss Duckert being a very classy lady, and believing in the
   great cathartic value of saying "shit" and knowing the three
   definite signs of spring (tree sap running, frogs croaking, mountain
   laurel blooming), I figured she probably knew what she was talking
   about, so I've followed her advice ever since.  (I also recommend the
   New Collegiate because I've always been able to find in it whatever
   word I was looking for.)

2. Punctuation and Grammar

   Several months ago, I noticed that the Globe started putting commas
   in front of "because."  I thought they were doing this just to be
   obnoxious (along with de-capitalizing words like "St." and "Ave."),
   but I have since noticed that several writers (including the great,
   the near great, and the not-so-hot) also do this.  Why????????????????

   Commas are the most overused and misused punctuation marks there are.
   Why do people insist on using them when they don't really need them?
   I learned several years ago when and when not to put a comma in front
   of "but" and once in awhile I will even put one in front of "except,"
   but I will NEVER (well, ALMOST never) put a comma in front of "because"!

   I've noticed in a few of the recent editions of DESPERADO that some
   people use the construction "would of" when they mean "would've"
   ("would have").  When you think about it, "would of" is so illogical
   it makes you wonder why anyone started using it.  Four months ago,
   I would've sworn that I had never seen "would of" (or "should of" or
   "could of"), but then I started re-reading Fitzgerald and Hemingway
   and noticed that they used the "of" constructions.  But just because
   they did it, Desperados (thank heavens Tom settled on this plural!),
   don't think you should use it, too.  They should've known better.

3. Pepsi Machines

   My best wishes to Steve Lionel in his attempt to have Pepsi machines
   installed in Spit Brook.  I've often envied the Merrimackians for
   being able to get Pepsi whenever they wanted it.  I used to be able
   to buy it in the Mill but then moved to the "deserts" of Tewksbury and
   Spit Brook.   Sigh . . .    To somewhat alleviate the problem, I
   started bringing in 8-packs of Pepsi, but this is awkward and sometimes
   I forgot to put a bottle in the refrigerator, so I couldn't have one
   when I wanted it.  In the immortal words of that famous Desperado,
   &gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJJT (or whatever it is), "Quel drag."

   Let's bring Pepsi to ZK!!

        FLASH -- FLASH -- FLASH -- flutter

There is now an answer to the question "How do I backup a Mini-Wini onto
Floppy disks?"

E.I.S. (Education and Information Systems) is selling an audio random
access floppy which can contain 45min of audio. The floppy is 15
inches (truely) squareand has RS-232 interface for control. The only
pa rts needed to interface to the PC are 1) an audio modulator to put
the data in audio 2) a LARGE pizza box to store the floppies in. With
high-density audio modulation the M.W. should fit on two
floppies...SOOOOO go to all you home engineers..

Subject: What is the plural of VAX?

Back about 1979 there was a name the plural of VAX contest in Methods
and Tools.  There were no prizes, and no winners.  VAXen was a frequent
suggestion, but there were about a dozen others.  After a very frustrating
day, I suggested VEX.

Subject: Trivia and Such

I'd like to mention that I have perhaps the largest collection of
computer generated calendars and pictures in DECland.  Also have
tons of Games and related nifty stuff.  Jokes Too.  If you would
like a list of such stuff, let me know.

Subject: LOGO Available

I seem to remember someone asking in Desperado whether the LOGO language
was available for DEC machines. Just read in the 12/20/82 Sales Update
that it's now available for the PC300 series personal computer; at
least it WILL be available in Q1/FY84 (that's somewhere between July 1
and October 1 1983, boys and girls). List price is $250. SDC order number
is QA179-C3 (in case any Desesperados don't know, SDC usually won't
accept any orders until the product is officially released).

I don't remember whether the questioner said that Logo is a new language
(just what the world needs!) for "teaching programmers and logical
thinking to beginners." Apparently, it does work to some degree and has
been used in grade schools with Apple-class machines. Should be interesting
to play with.

So don't pine for those Robins, amigos; the PC300s will be fun to own, too,
once the Powers tell us what kind of discount we'll get.

Subject: oh no, not more computer poetry!

The latest example of computer poetry is from G. Brandreth, MORE JOY
OF LEX. (Eat your heart out, Dylan Thomas.)

        How can the purple yeti be so red,
        Or chestnuts, like a widgeon calmly groan?
        No sheep is quite as crooked as a bed,
        Though chickens ever try to hide a bone.
        I grieve that greasy turnips slowly march:
        Indeed, inflated is the icy pig:
        For as the alligator strikes the larch,
        So sighs the grazing goldfish for a wig.
        Oh, has the pilchard argued with a top?
        She never that the parsnip is too weird!
        I tell thee that the wolf-man will not hop
        And no man ever praised the convex beard.
        Effulgent is the day when bishops turn:
        So let not the doctor wake the urn.

Brandreth says that it "was produced by a computer fed with a long
list of words, classified by parts of speech and numbers of
syllables." Well, now, there are a couple of lines that smack of Eliot
 --- but then there always are --- and the line about chickens hiding
a bone is nearly very Yeatsian, wot? The inflated icy pig could be
right out of Betjeman or Amis.  In fact, the whole thing sounds like
Auden on an acid trip.

(In case anyone's wondering, there are some enjoyable things in
Brandreth's book --- notably a reprinting of one of Dorothy Parker's
more vitriolic book reviews, and a list of Goldwynisms.)

I think these computer "poetry" people do not understand "poetry" and
therefore think that "poetry" is a string of words no one could ever
understand.  By these standards, "poetry" is easy to write.  Even a
computer can do it.  My understanding of "poetry" is that is is a
means of communication in which every word carries a maximum amount of
freight, not a minimum amount, as here, and in so much other "poetry"
that we see.  Things fall apart, the center will not hold . . .
