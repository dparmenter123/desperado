There's another one, less obvious than the Spanish "Rio Grande River".
Western maps of Thailand for many years have marked the body of water
which flows through the capital, Bangkok, as the Chao Phya River. No
doubt because when some amateur mapmaker got off the boat, and said "what's
that?", a native said "Chao Phya" or, loosely translated, "Yes, you turkey,
that's the river."

A propos of the smoking issue: I have been plowing (or, better, sledging)
my way through "South," Sir Ernest Shackleton's account of his ill-fated
trip to the Antarctic aboard the Endurance (and a horrifying
story it is), and have found several references that might help people
realize how difficult it is to resist the demon - in one case,
the crew have survived a brutal crossing of 800 miles of the worst water
on earth in a small boat, baling and freezing by turns, and are at last
safe (relatively) on land, with food and fresh water finally at hand. What's
the first thing they go for? Got it in one -- tobacco!

And some of you may recognize our epigraph this issue from the PBS series
_The_Last_Place_on_Earth_, a study contrasting the exploring styles of
Roald Amundsen (yaaaay!!) and Robert Falcon Scott (booooo!!) when racing
for the South Pole. I was brought up to believe that Scott was the bee's
pajamas and that Amundsen was a low hound, but what changed my mind was
reading the splendid and scarifying book that the series was based on,
_The_Last_Place_on_Earth_, by Roland Huntford. For sheer exhilaration and
vituperation, I can't recommend it too highly. To put it crudely, Scott
didn't know his ass from his elbow when it came to Antartic exploration.
He believed that since he was in the Royal Navy, he should be able to do
anything without thinking about it or preparing for it in any way, mind you.
And incidentally with a callous disregard for the value of human life that
appalled me. Amundsen on the other hand spent his entire life preparing
and learning and perfecting his equipment, and when he achieved the South
Pole, the British sneered at him because he was a professional. An interesting
point about the evolution of language. Then a professional was something to
be sneered at, now it's something exalted for everything from car washes to bug
spray. I refuse to let anybody call me a professional, by the way. The
professions are the Army, the Navy, the Church, and the Law. I'm a writer,
which makes me a craftsman. I'm a tech writer, which makes me a banana slug.

When I put Huntford down at last, and picked up my Christmas present
_Lake_Wobegon_Days_ and finished THAT, I was ready to go out and petition
somebody to change my ancestry to Norwegian. What a nation! Uffda!

In the wake of Kasperov vs. Karpov, some belated chess quotes, leftover
from the heady days when Bobby Fisher pulled off a *Rocky IV* on the
Russians.  (I was hospitalized with a broken leg and learned to play chess
for lack of anything more sinful to do.  Characteristically, at age 22 or
so, I had dreams of someday writing a George Steiner-ish piece comparing
the hypermodernist school of chess with modernism in literature and art.
In paradise, there is a library filled with the books people have dreamed
of writing but have never done.)

A game is always won through a mistake, either the opponent's or
one's own.

                           "Mate is always someone's mistake."]

Sacrifices only prove that someone has blundered.

                           "White wins unless black blunders."]

In the opening, a master should play like a book; in the middle game,
like a magician; in the endgame, like a machine.
                                        -- Chernev [also attributed to Spielman]

Poets do not go mad; but chess players do.

                                           neglected classic, by the way, which
                                           even a village atheist like me can
                                           enjoy...in small doses.]

When you don't know what to do, wait for your opponent to get an idea
-- it's sure to be wrong.
                                                        -- Tarrasch

Chess is a matter of delicate judgment, knowing when to punch and how
to duck.
                -- Fisher, who once said that what he enjoyed about
                   chess matches was crushing the other man's ego

win.

Alexandr Alakein, the great Russian chess master, got on the train at
Dniepopetrovsk, headed in a  leisurely way for Alexandrovsk, thence to
Pinsk, then Minsk, then Omsk and Tomsk. As was his wont, he pulled out
a small travelling chessboard and started working out a pretty problem
that had come to his attention. The chap in the tarboosh across the aisle
offered to play him a game to pass the time.

"Sure," said Alakein. "I'll give you a rook."

"Give me a rook! You don't even know me!"

"Listen," said Alakein, "if I couldn't give you a rook, I would know you."

I don't recollect where I heard this.  Last year, when there was a flurry
of possibilities that Bruce Springsteen would perform in the Boston
area, some Celtics were discussing getting tickets.  Larry Bird, who
is almost as monomaniacal as Fisher, wanted to know who this Springsteen
guy is.  He'd never heard of him.  "Larry," explained Dan Shaughnessy,
the *Globe* sports writer, "he is the you of rock 'n' roll."

More "irregular conjugations."  I think these are by Bertrand Russell:

     "I am firm-willed; you are stubborn; he is a pig-headed fool."
     (Or, "I am maintaining a principle; you are obstinate; he is a fanatic.")

     "I am righteously indignant; you are annoyed; he is making a
      fuss over nothing."

     "I reconsidered it; you changed your mind; he went back on his
      word."

A college friend of mine, who possesses one of the quickest minds I
know, instantly came up with: "I am a Renaissance man; you are
a dilettante; he is a bum."

More slowly, I came up with:

   "I do research; you duplicate work; he plagiarizes."

   "I am experimenting with altered states of consciousness; you
   are a pot-head; he is a junky." (This was our 1968 version of
   "I am a connoisseur; you can't hold your liquor; he is a drunkard.")

   "I am a writer; you are a technical writer; he writes computer manuals."

   "I am a software engineer; you are a programmer; he works on a computer."

   "I am a literary critic; you are a book reviewer; he is a hack writer."

And these even more irregular grammatical variations:

   "I am a consultant. You don't know what you're talking about. He is
   an example of the Peter Principle."

   "I feel ill; you will feel better in the morning; he is a hypochondriac."

   "I am concerned about correct English; you are being picky; he is
   pedant and a snob."

Subj:   quick summary of State of the Company meeting

On December 5th, I represented Bill Segal in attending  the  State  of
the  Company  meeting in MK.  The meeting was VERY upbeat, and was one
of the most positive large  meetings  I  have  attended  at  DEC.   The
concentration  was  "networking",  and  this permeated the entire day.
Mahandra gave a good technical overview talk in the morning,  and  his
data  was  referred  to throughout the day.  His talk was excellent --
just about right for the diverse audience.  A  good  number  of  those
attending were from the field.

Highlight for me was Ken Olsen's opening talk.  The night  before  was
the  announcement  of  the  8650,  plus several software announcements
which included an rdb  and  dbms  which  worked  transparently  across
networks,  plus  VAXset.   Evidently  the feedback that Ken got on the
software announcements were still fresh in his mind,  as  his  opening
remarks talked about SOFTWARE!  He talked about the 8650 announcement,
and how "we have said that software is important, but when we have the
opportunity we talk about hardware".  Users' comments to him the night
before implied that  they  were  excited  that  "Digital  was  finally
                                                               ^^^^^^^
beginning  to  understand  that Digital has the software to put it all
together".  And so a number of nice words  were  said  about  software
products.

Ken overviewed some of the problems that Digital has been having,  and
his  theme  was  that  up to now we have been able to deliver and have
been delivering almost anything that customers want in the  networking
field.   But  it  costs enormous amounts of time and effort and $.  In
order to keep the  salesman  from  being  a  software  and  networking
expert,  Digital  was  announcing a set of package systems which would
cover the majority of the  user's  needs.   These  would  require  the
salesman  to know less to satisfy the needs of the customer.  Ken felt
that we need to show  the  world  how  to  do  networking  boldly  and
effectively  or  we may not survive as a company.  [in fact, he stated
that "if the rest of the world wasn't doing so poorly, we'd  be  doing
yucky!"].                                   ^^

The next speakers, Chick Shu and Pete Smith, focused on the fact  that
we  do need to unravel the mystery that surrounds our offerings in the
networking  area,  and  that  we  must  be  providing  DEC   customers
"integrated  solutions".   That  seemed  to  be  the buzz word for the
day...the need of our customers  for  complete  integrated  solutions.
But  there  was  a  lot  of hype around the fact that customers should
choose DEC because 1)best networking:  decnet  and  ethernet  2)  best
architecture:    VAX/VMS   with   its  family  compatibility  3)  most
applications (DEC  software,  cooperative  mktg  partners,  OEM's  and
independents,  and  network  advantages)  --  and  here all-in-one and
baseway were touted along with Ultrix -- and 4) most expertise.

Even with mechanical drones like the Gray Puke [a computer-controlled rocket
engine tester,  not  well  liked  by  the technicians it 'replaced' -+- Sid]
usurping the human role, the man-behind-the-machine could still display some
semblance of  individuality. Consider, for example, the case of the petulant
computer-printer -  when  the  machine  apparently  took  umbrage during the
automatic checkout sequence in preparation for an acceptance firing.

The moment  of  truth  for  the  test  arrived  -  the signal to fire. After
uncounted  hours of preparation, hundreds of workers now stood by to observe
the  climactic  moment  of  ignition.  In  the  crowded blockhouse, all eyes
focused  on  the rows of computers and monitor screens displaying their last
fragments of information. Finally, the test conductor typed in his `request'
to start the terminal countdown for static firing. The computer whirred, and
the automatic typewriter responded with a singular reply, "Say please."

Startled, the  test  conductor  concluded  he  had  made a typing error, and
repeated  his original message more carefully. The balky computer was not to
be denied. "Say please," it insisted.

At this  point,  the  crowd in the blockhouse began stirring restlessly. The
loaded  S-IVB,  readied for firing, remained poised nearby with thousands of
gallons  of  liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen primed for detonation. People
were  getting tense. Reasonably certain he was only working against a faulty
firing tape, the test conductor quickly decided to make one more try, rather
than  put  it  into discard and risk more precious time to put a replacement
tape  into  operation.  So once more, he entered into the machine his humble
request to fire, with a polite notation at the end: "please."

This time,  there  was  no  problem.  "This is your programmer," the machine
clattered  back,  "wishing  you  good  luck."  And  with  a roar, the rocket
ignited.

have been inventing a new improved wheel. And every time some new malevolent
message would appear on the screen, I'd frantically type in "@ HAVE-A-COOKIE"
but to no avail. It ended up sullenly "All right, keep your old cookie then!"

A comment in the last issue sparked my interest about the word "marketeer".
I looked it up in the dictionary (an unabridged, albeit not a very good
unabridged:  how can you trust anything that calls itself a "deluxe
unabridged dictionary"?).

Anyway, "marketeer" does not appear, but "marketer", meaning one who markets,
does appear.  At first, I thought that "marketeer" was just another of
those invented spellings that we illiterates in Hi-Tech are famous for.
On reflection, however, I now think that this spelling is actually a very
clever play on the word "privateer", defined to be "a ship or vessel of
war owned and equipped by one or more private persons, and licensed by a
government to seize or plunder the ships of an enemy in a war".  This
interpretation goes a long way toward explaining a lot of things nowadays,
doesn't it?

To:  My employees                           Date:  12 December 1985
                                            From:  Yer manager
Subj:  Another Warm Holiday Message

Let me say first that I support, both wholly and in part, an
earlier holiday message you received.  Though much
sentimentalized, from a corporate point of view, Christmas is a
productivity sink.  I would like to suggest several measures that
could make Christmas 1985 a winner on the bottom line.  Please
observe the following guidelines:

      o  CHRISTMAS MESSAGES OVER THE NETWORK:

         In the past, much time has been lost while employees
         watched Christmas trees being built on their screens or
         listened to "Jingle Bells" played by the terminal
         warning bell.  This must stop.  It was reported to me
         that a former CDD writer, using a Pro 350 in terminal
         emulation mode, once spent 23 minutes watching Santa
         come down the chimney of a ranch house.  Multiply this
         by the number of Pro 350s in the corporation and you can
         see that several hours of work could be lost.

      o  BLINKING TIES:

         While I as a person appreciate the keen sense of humor
         and joie de vivre that inspires some of our employees to
         wear blinking ties during the holidays, we do not slap
         our corporate knees at such hijinks during working
         hours.  You are free to wear such electrical garments to
         work if you must, but please refrain from turning them
         on except at lunch and during your normal break time.
         When such devices are operating, please avoid entering
         the machine room.  Under no circumstances should you use
         corporate power to operate your tie.

      o  MISTLETOE:

         This quaint custom may have been acceptable in the less
         moral Victorian era, but it has no place in the
         corporate environment.  In the past, hanging this
         seemingly innocuous plant has encouraged employees to
         embrace and even kiss, sometimes leading said employees
         to:

He's got something there about the blinking ties. While caroling merrily
all over Spit Brook with the Spit Brook Singers, we saw a young lady with
a blinking sweatshirt. Not a tie of course, but I imagine it comes within the
meaning of the act.

Subj:   &lt;?&gt; goes better with Coke?

Here is the article regarding the contraceptive qualities of Coca-Cola.
They should have waited for the April 1st edition...

Forwarded from Hackers_Guild@Berkeley:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     From The New England Journal of Medicine:

                    Effect of "Coke" on Sperm Motility

     To the Editor: Various methods of vaginal contraception have been used
  since antiquity. The Egyptians recommended honey and sodium bicarbonate;
  acid fruit juices and a variety of oils have also been used throughout
  history.[1] Postcoital douching with household substances was a popular form
  of contraception at the beginning of this century, and Coca-Cola is still
  said to be used in developing countries for this purpose.[2] The efficacy of
  Coca-Cola as a postcoital contraceptive appears dubious since its use has
  been perpetuated through folklore rather than scientific evidence. We could
  find no study measuring the effect of Coca-Cola on sperm motility in vitro.
  In addition, there has recently been controversy over the attributes of
  old-formula ("Classic") Coke and those of "New Coke." We therefore compared
  the effect of various modern formulations of Coca-Cola on sperm motility.

     We used semen from a healthy, fertile donor and various formulations of
  Coca-Cola (Table 1). The semen was liquified at 37 C, and 0.05-ml aliquots
  were transfered to test tubes containing 0.25 ml of the formulation (newly
  opened and at room temperature). Samples were incubated at room temperature,
  and the percentage of sperm motility was evaluated at one minute by direct
  microscopical observation.

  Table 1. Effect of Various Types of Coca-Cola on Sperm Motility in Vitro.

                              Sperm Motility at 1 Minute      pH of Coke
                                    % control

  Old ("Classic") Coke                  8.5                       2.38
  New Coke                              41.6                      2.37
  New Coke - caffine free               16.6                      2.25
  Diet Coke                             0                         2.89

     The results are summarized in Table 1. All samples of Coca-Cola markedly
  reduced sperm motility, whereas saline had no spermicidal effect after the
  one minute interval. Diet Coke had the strongest effect, and Classic Coke
  was shown to have five times the spermicidal effect of New Coke.

     The effectiveness of Coca-Cola as a spermicidal agent in vaginal douching
  has been attributed to its acidic pH.[2] Although the spermicidal effect
  varied with the different formulations of Coca-Cola, we found no significant
  difference in their pH values, suggesting that a component of the Coca-Cola
  "secret formula" may be a cofactor in the effect. Although not recommended
  for postcoital contraception, partly because sperm can be found in the
  oviducts within minutes after intercourse,[3] Coca-Cola products do appear
  to have a spermicidal effect. Furthermore, our data indicate that at least
  in the area of spermicidal effect, "Classic" Coke "is it."

Subj:   Holiday offerings

Two minor but rather delightful gems from the current Datamation.

   Item: on pp. 28-29 is a double-spread ad for IBM's System/36
   family, and its latest member, the System/36 PC.  Overleaf,
   starting on p. 30 is a double-spread article on System/36 titled
   "Out of Gas."  The juxtaposition is quite nice.  The story
   is in fact also featured on the cover with the title "System/36:
   Oversold, Underpowered."

   Item: in an article on p. 32 on possible multi-user DOS systems,
   Intel's 80386 microprocessor is mentioned, with the following
   comment.  "The chip's on-board memory management, 4 gigabytes
   of real memory, and 64 trillion bytes, or terabytes, of virtual
   address space make it attractive as a host for multi-user software."
   They don't say so, but it seems that 4 gigabytes of on-chip memory
   should also be a pretty good response to Japan's threat to dominate
   the market for the next generation of semiconductor memory.

Subj:   happy holidays confirmed

(From usenet)

        At the end of the current United Nations General Assembly session the
words "Happy Holidays" was flashed on the voting board.  In a Pavlovian
reaction, many of the delegates began voting on it.
        I'm sure you will be pleased to know that the "resolution" passed
113 in favor, 5 against, with 7 abstentions.

It's been pointed out to me that there is now a node called NEMO, and that
labelling contributions from NEMO, to indicate anonymity, are no longer
appropriate. My informant requested the following attribution, using OUTIS,
which is Greek for 'NO PERSON', which is what NEMO means in Latin, but I dunno.
If there is a NEMO::GREEN_GIANT out there, I apologize, but I think NEMO has
a nice ring to it. Anyway, it's sanctified by usage and precedence.

    I was wanting to go from London to Woking, so I went to Paddington and
bought a ticket for the local.  Having a few minutes on my hands, I stopped
into a newsagent's and bought a copy of the Grauniad to sleep behind, and then
I strolled out onto the platform.
    The train was already there, so I went on and took a quiet seat in a no
smoking carriage, and settled down for a pleasant ride.  The next thing I knew
we were in motion, and the guard was in the carriage punching tickets.
    "Excuse me," I said to the guard, "but I've been dozing off and I simply
must get off at Woking.  Could you let me know when we get there?"
    "Oh, sir, I'm sorry," he said, "but you've taken the wrong train.  We
don't stop at Woking."
    Well, you can imagine that I panicked properly.  "But I've got to get
there," I protested.  "I've got a very important conference there at ten.
What am I going to do?"
    "There's nothing for it, sir, but that you'll have to change trains at
Reading and go back," said the guard.  "You'll only be half an hour or so
late."
    I couldn't do that, I argued, cos I'd miss the meeting.  I cajoled and I
pleaded, but he was adamant.  That train didn't stop at Woking, and that was
that.
    Finally I said, "Look, friend, how about a cigar?"  I offered him one of
mine.  "I like you," I said.
    He reached out his hand and took the cigar and said, "Thanks, and that's
more than I can say for you."  He pocketed the cigar.  "But that's all right.
I'll tell you what I'll do.  After I do all the tickets I'll go and ask the
driver if he can stop for you."  And he betook himself off to the front of the
train.
    I breathed a sigh of relief and turned to my paper.  Where better to find
a laugh?
    He was back in about ten minutes.  "I asked the driver," he announced.
    "Yes?  What did he say?"
    "He says we don't stop at Woking."
    I groaned inwardly.
    "But," he continued, "he says he'll slow down.  Now look, I've got this
all figured out.  I'll hold you out like a sack of mail, and you start
running, and when you're running fast enough I'll let you go."  He wore a
completely straight face; I could see that he was serious.
    I looked him up and down, and he looked like an American football hero,
seven feet tall and all muscle.  I thought about his offer.  It just might
work.  So I agreed.  I didn't really have a choice, did I then, with the train
not stopping and me needing to get off...
    Well, you guessed it.  The driver didn't even begin to slow down.  I think
he even sped up a little; maybe he thought it was funny.  But it was my only
chance to get off, and we weren't an express, so I told the guard to go ahead.
He slung me out the window and I started running in the air.  I was pumping as
fast as I could go, and I could see that it wasn't fast enough, the pavement
was flying past beneath me.
    So I took another gasp and pumped faster.  How, I don't know, but I did
it.
    The far end of that platform began to look terrifyingly close, and the
guard kept holding me.  I began to get worried; after all, I was going to need
some distance to slow down.  Just when I was ready to scream, he let me go.  I
hit the pavement, and let me tell you I never scrambled so fast in my life.
My feet were a blur, and I was dying, trying desperately to keep from being
bowled over by my own momentum.
    Just before I reached the end of the platform, god knows how many bones
I'd have broken, some idiot in the very last carriage grabbed my shirt from
behind and hauled me back aboard the train.
    He dragged me through the carriage window and sat me in the seat opposite
him.  "You're lucky I managed to grab you," he said, "or you'd never have made
it aboard.  This train doesn't stop at Woking."
