Subj:   No college professor needed

&gt; Somewhere in Moby Dick there's a chapter about the male whale's sex organ,
&gt; but you have to get a college professor to help you find it, the passage,
&gt; that is, not the sex organ, which is apparently pretty hard to hide.

Chapter 95, "The Cassock."  "Not the wondrous cistern in the whale's huge
head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his
symmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of
that unaccountable cone, -- longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot
in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg."

(I used to have a VAXstation named PEQUOD, which was rammed and sunk from time
to time by Moby DECwindows.)

(The organ itself, in the living, unexcited creature, is probably not in
evidence.  I suspect that in the interests of streamlining, it is not deployed
until needed.)

Subj:   Honk

Tomas,

     Ah, DESPERADO.  A nice start to any right-thinking person's day (or
mine, for that matter).

FWIW:  The item about the "Honk if you love Jesus" bumper sticker brought
to mind a similar experience I had a coupla months ago...

During my lunch hour, the day's errands took me to downtown Nashua.  I
pulled up behind a car already stopped at a busy intersection.  After I'd
been there about a minute, I got a little restless and, noticing the "Honk
if you love Jesus" bumper sticker on the car ahead of me, sounded two
short, staccato "beeps".

Immediately, the driver opened her door, put one foot on the pavement,
leaned out and yelled, "Eat shit!  I can't pull out" causing me to smirk at
the irony of the situation.  I suppose she mistook my smirk as being
directed at her, for I was then on the receiving end of the snappy
repartee, "Waddayawannafight?!?"

What choice did I have but to back my car up ever so slightly and respond,
"Take another step out of that car and I'll run your ass over"?  She bought
the bluff and got back in her car, fortunately.

I think the experience is more common than one might think.

     Anyway... glen

Subj:   and a one, and a two ...

You've probably already gotten a lot of obnoxious letters about this, and
you'll probably get a lot more, so my one may not make any difference.
But having graduated from college as a math major, I figure that I have
some kind of obligation to point this one out.

Desperado #2022 includes the following statement from Our Distinguished
Editor:

&gt; And, just to be tedious, 1990 is one of the ten years of the *eighth*
&gt; decade of the 20th century ...

Desperado tedious?  Never!  In this case, however, I believe that you are
in error.

As you know, the first decade of the first century (which must have been
around the time that Desperado first came out, if you're up to #2022 by
now) began in the year 1 and ended in the year 10.  This means that the
first decade of the 20th century ended in the year 1910, and the eighth
ended in 1980.  1990, therefore, will be one of the ten years of the *ninth*
decade of the 20th century.  (Stan Rabinowitz probably could have written
this paragraph better, but we can't all be touched by genius.)

More to the point, 1990 will be the *final* year of the decade, and none
too soon.  Personally, I think that the eighth decade of this century was
a lot better; it included the end of both the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon's
political career, for example.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
If Stan Rabinowitz tries touching me, he'd better guard his genius well.

As Karnak might say, "wrong again, fencepost-breath".

 1981 -- 1990: 9th decade

Which reminds me: since the Catholic Church now has a Cardinal Law
(Boston) and a Cardinal Sin (Philippines), can't they manage to arrange
for a Cardinal Number?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Better a fencepost error than a deadly embrace.  Who's counting, not me,
but I was demi-right about something.  See below.

My numbering system is modeled on that employed by comic books and
independent record companies, which, in brief, is "Give it any damn old
number you please as long as it looks interesting."  I sent hundreds of
these suckers out with no number (mostly short ones), but people began to
fear they were missing something, so I started numbering at 1002 (the
numbers up through 1001 having been consumed by Shahrazade in counting the
Arabian Nights). Then, when I came back to DEC and resumed publication
(upon perfervid imprecations from the inheritor) I jumped the numbers up to
2002 (pace Sir Arthur C. "Geosynchronous Satellite" Clark, discoverer of
the prehistoric crystal skull).  Okay?

Subj:   nice try, but no cigar

&gt;From Desperado:

        Cactus" is a word of Greek, not Latin, origin, so "cacti" is not its
        plural.  That leaves you with either "cactodes" or "cactuses".  I use
        the latter, but of course "cacti" is a favorite of the erudite.

The Greek part is correct; however, any dictionary will negate your
conclusion that cacti is not the plural of cactus. The dictionaries I
looked in specifically list "-ti" as the first-choice plural form.
That's erudite.

I'd say that cacti is a favorite of us plain folks as well as the
erudite, because we know that it is correct. It's those people
who think they are more learned than plain folks but are not truly
erudite who are insecure about the plural of cactus.

/Ron

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Yo, Ron, I form my English plurals by adding "s", or "es", or changing the
"y" to "i" and adding "es" on words from all languages because I really
don't know how to form the plural of the prolapsed subjective form in
Bongolian and I'm not all that sure about Greek and Latin.  So, if I say
"hippopotamuses" (another Greek word, meaning "river horse") I feel good,
but if I say "hippopotami" I feel like an idiot, because somebody who
really knows Greek and Latin, or both, might come along and prove me to be
one.  (If I say the 80s were the eighth decade of the century I also feel
like an idiot.)  I like to save the fancy plurals for technical situations,
so books have "indexes", but mathematical expressions have "indices".  I'm
on the fence about "millenia", but the people who go to Decus sure don't
know that "symposia" is a plural, and a kind of interesting thing has
happened to "media" and "data" and "insignia" where they used to be plurals
and have now turned into some kind of pseudo-singular collective nouns.
(But the singular of "insignia" is *not* "insignium", it's "insigne", which
is an example of the kind of trap I'm trying to avoid by insisting that
"cactus" and "hippopotamus" are good English (American) words and should
get their plurals the same way as all the rest of 'em.)  But, to get back
to the main point, which is me being full of it, where I'm really full of
it is in implying that "cactus" is a Greek word only when it is also a
Latin word.  See below.

By the way, while we're chatting about language and noticing your personal
name, I'll pass this one along.  I have kid's book of Norwegian to English
and vice versa which translates the soundly formed Norwegian word
"semi-trailer" into the English equivalent, "articulated pantechnicon".

And I'm sure I've mentioned my favorite Norwegian cognate, which is
"skumgummi" for "foam rubber".

And how about that punctuation outside the "quotes"?

Howdy! Was just noting your comment on the word 'cactus' in the latest
Desper.

It do seem like the thing started as KAKTWS ('Scuse that fuktup sigma
on the end there, and the lowercase omega before it. Just can't get
this charset to behave itself), but I think that 'cactus' is a
sufficiently latinized form that 'cacti' isn't really a _bad_ plural
for it. On the other hand, if some jerk objects to 'cactuses' on
snooty correctness grounds, it is fun to mash their face into the
nearest barrel while you go look for your OED, with which to blow them
away.

Do you really truly mean that we can and should forward Desper around
with abandon? I'll shoot some copies into MicroSnot if it's true.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Yeah, I really mean it, I guess.  I used to have a lot of DEC-bashing in
here, when it was limited to in-house, but after spending three years on
the "outside" I had a lot of folks I wanted to send it to who didn't work
for DEC, so I changed the content.  Of course, it had been going outside
DEC for years before that, but I made it explicit in 1988.  Lots of people
forward Desperado to mailing lists, so I really have no idea what the
circulation is, which is kind of thrilling, because I also have no idea
*who* the circulation is either.  So I get frissons out the wazoo.
Microsnot!  And up the ying-yang.

                Global warming:  New source found

WASHINGTON - Livestock contribute to global warming by emitting flatulence
containing methane into the atmosphere, and steps must be taken to reduce such
emissions, the US Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday in a new
report.  Methane is an important greenhouse gas which contributes to about 20
percent of expected future global warming, it said.  An agency spokesman said
ways of reducing methane emissions from livestock were still not available.

                    ROSALIND RUSSELL RAPS TO LERNER AND LOWE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Rap goes way back.  If you use the definition of rhythmic chanting for
    rap, it may be the oldest form of music.  If you limit the definition
    to black urban rhythmic chanting, it is still as old as the 20th
    century.  There are hundreds of "toasts", as they were called, written
    about the Titanic.  Jack Johnson, the great black boxer, was denied
    passage on the ship, so the toasts centered on what Jack could have
    done if he'd been on board.  If you heard somebody do one of these
    toasts, you'd swear they were rapping.  And the Titanic is only one
    subject.  Stagolee, Frankie and Johnny, and John Henry all started out
    in toasting.  Another form of proto-rapping is called the "dirty
    dozens",  stylized, back and forth insults, much as you can hear on Bo
    Diddley's "Say Man".  Lots of what Bo does is really rapping.
    Experimental pop poetry groups in the 60s like Scaffold, the Liverpool
    Scene, and particularly The Last Poets were getting pretty rappy.
    There's even a rap song by Lerner and Lowe in their musical, "Wonderful
    Town" called "Old Man Mose".  I'll  quote a bit of lyric to prove the
    point. It's done over just a drumbeat.  "Old man Mose, he kicked that
    bucket, down in the well, well well well." Rosalind Russell does the
    tune. More recent examples of white-folk rapping are Lou Reed's "Walk
    on the Wild Side" and Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues"  Another
    rap hit was "Gimme Dat Ding" by the Pitkins (1971?), as was the
    notorious 50s novelty, "They're Coming to Take Me Away, Aha!" by
    Napoleon XIV. The Bonzo Dog Band did "Humanoid Boogie" in which they
    promised, "The Humanoid boogie's gonna get to number one on the
    cha-cha-charts voted by the people-eeple-eeple of the record-buying
    publicoid."  The Rolling Stone's "Get Offa My Cloud" is clearly based
    on rap style.  Dire Straits' "Industrial Disease" is a rap.  The other
    night on a documentary about TV commercials, I saw "you'll wonder where
    the yellow went" done rap style in a 1956 Pepsodent commercial.  As for
    rap being filled with boasting, what would rock'n'roll be without
    boasting?

                    All you people sayin' raps no good
                    Don't go sayin it in my neighborhood
                    It's got the moves, it's got the style
                    It's been right here for quite a while
                    I even think that one fine day
                    Everbody's gonna know it'll never go away.

It's about time somebody gave credit to the creator of that terminal art
bat that's been kicking around the net for the last couple of years, and
shows up in the last Desperado. It's the work of the talented longtime bat
freak Bill Wivell, of ESDP/MR. Bill also draws a mean BA123 enclosure
backplane removal and replacement procedure, as well as PostScript Batman
logos and a Batman skull.

I don't know what the hell myotis lucifigus means, but I think it has to do
with bats (though mushrooms or sharks are other possibilities), but that has
been his personal name for years.

He also promised to haul that '73 Honda 450 out of my front yard before
winter sets in. What a guy!

[Not quite the right mailing list but close.  If you don't care about

loops out to Hawaii, or big hairy construction projects hit D now.]

---

Several days ago a very large number of trucks and men from the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power descended on my neighborhood. They removed
large sections of Pershing drive to a depth of 15 feet or so over a stretch
of about a city block.  I assumed they had a problem with a water main or
something.

When they started building semi-permanent structures over the holes I knew
something really big was up.  When the large trucks full of strange power
tools, mega-welding machines, breathing equipment, and racks of test
equipment came I started wondering.  Driving by a couple nights ago (11
PM), I noticed that the pace hadn't slowed - they were at it 24 hours a
day.

My curiosity got the best of me yesterday when they brought in the giant
tanks full of liquid nitrogen.  LN-2 for the DWP?  I parked my car and
played the lookie loo.

It turns out they have a problem with an underground wire.  Not just any
wire but a 230 KV, many-hundred-amp, 10 mile long coax cable.  It shorted
out.  (Lotta watts!)  It feeds (fed) power from the Scattergood Steam Plant
in El Segundo to a distribution center near Bundy and S.M. Blvd.

To complicate matters the cable consists of a copper center conductor
living inside a 16 inch diameter pipe filled with a pressurized oil
dielectric.  Hundreds of thousands of gallons live in the entire length of
pipe.  Finding the fault was hard enough.  But having found it they still
have a serious problem.  They can't afford to drain the whole pipeline -
the old oil (contaminated by temporary storage) would have to be disposed
of and replaced with new (pure) stuff which they claim takes months to
order (in that volume).  The cost of oil replacement would be gigantic
given that it is special stuff.  They also claimed the down time is costing
the costing LA $13,000 per hour.  How to fix it and fast?

That's where the LN-2 comes in.  An elegant solution if you ask me. They
dig holes on both sides (20-30 feet each way) of the fault, wrap the pipe
with giant (asbestos-looking) blankets filled with all kind of tubes and
wires, feed LN-2 through the tubes, and *freeze* the oil. Viola!
Programmable plugs!  The faulty section is drained, sliced, the bad stuff
removed, replaced, welded back together, topped off, and the plugs are
thawed.  I was amazed.

------

The next day:

Last night the DWP held a curbside chat to allay the neighborhood's fears
that they were going to accidentally blow us all up.   Apparently all the
vapor clouds from all the LN-2 blowoff had caused a great deal of concern.

Interesting bits:

The feeder was laid 17 years ago and was designed to have an MTBF of 60
years.  There are other similar feeders in use around California, in the
Pacific North West, and some on the east coast.  This was the first failure
in the western US.  No one out here had any idea how to fix it so they
brought in experts from the east.  (NYC has had some faults.)

This link is a very critical part of the LA power grid.  Last night the
city engineers verified the $13,000 per hour power cost figure quoted the
day before.  (I guess that means they are being forced to buy power off the
grid somewhere else.)

There are actually three center conductors (they had a cross sectional
model to show us).  Each is about 3" in diameter with a one inch solid
copper core.  Each is wrapped with hundreds of layers of a special paper.
That, in turn, is sheathed with copper and then each one is spiral-wrapped
its entire segment-length with a 1/4 inch bronze "wire".  The three
conductors are then twisted together during the pulling process.  The
bronze spiral wraps form a kind of linear bushing with minimal contact area
with the inside of the pipe so it's "easy" to pull each segment.  Ha.

Each of the three legs in the feeder carrys 600-800 Amps (depending on
demand) of 230KV three phase power.  The ground return is the Santa Monica
Bay.  Down at the Scattergood Steam Plant and up in Santa Monica they have
a giant copper anchor out in the bay.

They lay these things in 2000-foot segments.  2000' is the longest segment
they can pull through the steel pipe.  The pipe is laid first and then the
internal cable(s) are pulled through.  Tensile forces must be enormous.  At
each segment joint (splice) there is a very large and expensive ($100K)
underground vault.  Future technology may allow them to go 3000 feet,
reducing the number of vaults needed per run, thereby saving money.

After the feeder was originally built (and the cable pulled) it was
thoroughly evacuated to both leak test and remove any contaminants.  It was
flushed with dry nitrogen and then reevacuated.  Golden Bear High Tension
Oil was then slowly added while still maintaining a vacuum so as to "pull"
any residual gas contaminants out of the oil and the cables in the pipe.
The pipe, full of oil, is then pressurized to about 200 PSI for some period
of time before it gets powered up.  200 PSI is maintained during operation
to keep any bubbles from forming and to drive insulating oil into the
paper.

At both ends of the pipeline they have 6000-gallon tanks of Golden Bear
lightly pressurized under a blanket of dry nitrogen.  There are pumps at
both ends.  There is about 100K gallons in the entire pipeline, not
including the 6K gal tanks.  Every six hours they reverse the pumps so the
oil oscillates back and forth in the pipe.  The pumps only run at 3 gallons
per minute but that is enough, over 6 hours, to get the oil in each
2000-foot segment to go at least a segment or two length in either
direction. This eliminates hot spots in the copper conductors and spreads
the heat out over several thousand feet.  A little competitive pressure is
always maintained between the pumps to get the 200 PSI.

They learned the hard way that you simply don't reverse the pumps lest you
get the Golden Bear equivalent of water hammer.  The last hour of every 6
hour cycle is spent slowly reducing the oil velocity down to zero before
you reverse it and then slowly ramp back up in the other direction.

In between segments, in the vaults, are temperature sensors embedded in the
pipe.  These monitor the oil temperature.  These are wired to a computer
downtown.  Because the oil oscillates, the DWP can track the temperature
gradient along the pipe and get an early indication of the location of any
hot spot problems.  They have regularly spaced flow rate and pressure
monitors for the same purpose - detecting and isolating faults.

Every vault also has a nipple which allows sampling of the pipe oil.  They
said you withdraw the oil through a thick membrane with a syringe (?). This
happens monthly on all feeders in the LA area.  The samples are analyzed
downtown by a staff of chemists who can relate the presence of things like
acetylene, butane, and benzene in the oil to arcing, coronas, and so forth.
Apparently the oil chemistry is a very good indicator of the health of the
segments.

One of their worst fears, after they open up the pipe, is having a blowout
of the freeze plugs. If they ever run out of nitrogen during the repair
process they'll lose one side of the pipe (or both).  Right now they the
pipe each side of the fault dropped down to 80 PSI.  They are afraid that
if they go any lower in oil pressure any gas in the oil will come out of
solution and cause an explosive expansion.  Not only that, but since there
is so much oil embedded in the paper insulation, any sort of gas bubbling
(oil foaming) would shred the insulation, rendering the entire feeder
useless.  They say it could take months to safely let the pressure off to
zero.  (That is the other reason ($13k/hr) they cannot afford to drain the
whole pipe.)

Even at 80 PSI, if they lose a freeze plug they will have a really big mess
outside the pipeline.  The holes they've dug cannot hold 100K gallons and
they're operating on a hill near the beach anyway...   (Big pollution
threat for LA basin.)  Potentially fatal for anyone around.  Right now they
have LN-2 companies on call from San Diego to San Francisco with
contingency plans of all sorts in case there is a major traffic problem
with trucks getting in.

They say the repair could take weeks or more, depending on what they find
when they get inside. They believe the cause of the fault was the inner
conductors slipping downhill inside the pipe and shorting against a metal
flange.  Even if that's true they wonder where it slipped to, and hence,
where it may be bunched up down hill.

Finding the fault was a problem in itself.  Since this was all new to them
they really didn't know how to start.  They tried time-domain reflectometry
equipment but got inconclusive information.  They tried ultrasound and
radar but that didn't work.  Then they got a thing called a "thumper"
shipped in which got them pretty close.  The thumper sends mondo-amp pulses
into one end of the cable.  The electromotive force tends to cause physical
displacement of the conductors which you can hear from the street level.
The place where the clicking stops is where the problem usually is.  This
got them to the defective segment.

What pinpointed the problem in the end was a bunch of car batteries and
some millivoltmeters. (From one technology extreme to the other.)  They
hooked up car batteries to both ends, tapped the cable at several points
(maybe there are taps in the vaults?) and, knowing the drops and resistance
of the cable, got within a few feet of the fault.   (I used to use the
exact same technique on memory boards.)

Next came the X-Ray equipment.  Sure enough, they can see the cable
shorting against the steel wall of the pipe.

Once all of the repair is done they still have to close it up.  How do you
weld a steel pipe with paper insulation inside?  Slowly.  They have special
heliarc welding equipment and "certified operators" who take 8 hours to
weld around one cross section of pipe.  They are required to keep their
hand on the pipe no more than 3 inches from the tip of the welder.  If it
is too hot for their hand they stop and let it cool.  After all, they can't
afford another failure.

Oct 20, 1989 Update

I am getting all of these bits from a guy named Jim who is the project
manager.  He looks kinda like a red neck RWK (Jesus in a hard hat with a
Harley belt buckle).  He is a really great guy.  Jim was one of the
splicers on the project 17 years ago when he was working his way through
school.  He is a now professional electrical and mechanical engineer.
After having worked his way up through the ranks at the DWP he is now The
Big Boss.  He claims to be having the time of his life - back in the field
with one of the biggest challenges of his career.  If we ever recruit a VP
of engineering I would hope its someone like him.

So, what went wrong?  Varying load conditions in the three legs of the
3-phase circuit caused tremendously strong and dynamic magnetic field
changes.  The electromagnetic forces between the three conductors and the
steel pipe (gack!) cause the conduit to wiggle around inside the pipe.
Over many years (and under the influence of gravity) the thing slipped and
wiggled every which way.  Also, due to very slight diametric temperature
gradients, the differential thermal expansion of a cable that big across
causes bending and warping forces.  Nobody ever thought of any of this.

Wiggle alone may not have cause the problem, however.  The spices between
cable segments are much larger in diameter than the cable itself.  The
steel pipe at these points is much larger than the main run.  So the whole
affair get fat and then shrinks down every 2000 feet or so.  What really
screwed them was failure to put any sort of clamp at the splices to keep
the fat splice from getting pulled into the narrower main runs.  This is
what cause the fault.

Jim says the fault lasted 20 milliseconds before breakers tripped.  (The
breakers for a wire like this are pretty amazing in their own right.  They
use high pressure gas to blow out the arc as the circuit begins to open.
Anything that can cut off this number of megawatts in 20 ms gets my
respect.)  It blew carbonized oil about 3000 feet down the pipe to either
side of the fault.  (Compute velocity...)

They will be removing a long length of cable from the faulted area for
analysis.  The entire length will be dissected.  Jim says the insulation
they have inspected at so far looks like shredded cauliflower due to the
explosion from the fault and the gas bubbling in it.  (BTW - The insulation
consists of 118 layers of paper tape.)

Based on X-ray imaging they are going to have to open up 14 of the 23
splices along the 10 mile run.  They'll have to drain the pipe to do so.
It will take them 2 months to take the pipeline down (depressurize and
drain).  (The oil will be recycled - see below.)  At each of the opened
splices they are going to install special aluminum (non magnetic) collars
around the conductors to keep the splices from getting pulled into the
necked-down section of the pipe.  These collars are being specially
fabricated now and will be ready in about a month.

At each splice they have to build a semi clean room to keep dirt, moisture,
worker sweat, and any other contaminants out of the joint before closing.
After all, we're talking a quarter megavolt!  They have special air
conditioning and filter units for the vaults.  Each joint will take two
months of work.  They will get some degree of parallelism in the phase of
the project.

After repairing and replacing the faulted section of cable, stabilizing all
of the splices, and buttoning it all up comes the job of putting the oil
back in.  First the pipe is evacuated and then back-filled with nitrogen
etc as I described earlier.  After extensive filtering, the oil is heated
to about 230 degrees farenheit.  It gets injected into a vacuum chamber at
the temperature thorough hundreds of spray nozzles. This gets the maximum
possible surface area so all the crap in it boils out into the chamber.
The good stuff that's left is collected and pumped immediately into one end
of the pipeline.

Then they power it up and see if it works.  If not, they start over again.
I'll keep you posted.

Less than a month after I bought my house and rented out my downstairs
apartment for the first time, the power to the house went out.  When
Edison dug it up, I could see that the junction box was a big wooden box
with the main line running through it and the service to my house sticking
off the side.  The box was filled with tar.  It had obviously been there
since the house was built in 1926.  Inside the truck were stacked a dozen
more identical wooden boxes, all stenciled "1988" and buckets of tar to
fill them with.  So, they ripped out the old box, fixed the service, and
stuck the wires all back inside the new box, which they filled with tar.
High tech stuff,  actual TBF 62 years.

Subject:  McRisks - Electronic Interference in Fast Food Automation

"The Importance of EMC in the Preparation and Selling of Big Macs," by Fernando
M. Esparza is a fascinating article in the September- October 1989 issue of
"EMC Technology."  (EMC = Electromagnetic Compatibility, the science/art of
getting electronic devices to work properly without interfering with one
another.)

Esparza, the author of McDonalds' "Electrical Disturbance Standards," has some
great war-stories to tell about problems cropping up in these highly automated
fast-food environments due to unforeseen interactions among appliances.  One he
described as "the most serious interference incident that McDonalds has ever
experienced" involved toasters and timekeeping.

It seems that when McDonalds decided to introduce McMuffin products, they had
to install special toasters.  Soon, many of their employee time-clocks
inexplicably started to gain 2 to 4 hours each day, crediting workers with more
hours than they had actually worked.  After a lot of head-scratching (and
testing), they discovered that the new toasters' voltage control circuits
induced voltage spikes in the powerline during normal operation - sometimes as
many as 120 per second.  This disrupted the clocks on the same power circuit,
since they monitored the alternating current's waveform for the purpose of
time-keeping: the voltage spikes increased the number of "zero-crossings,"
which were used as the metric.

"By the time we were able to pin down the problem exactly, there were more than
5,000 toasters installed in the restaurants...  Some restaurants reverted to
manual procedures for payroll timekeeping, but there were a number of employees
who were paid for extra time because of the clock errors.  Although the
managers were understandably upset, none of the crew complained."

Well, as you've probably all heard by now if the world's networks haven't
been too swamped because of it, the cookie story appears to be an "Urban
Myth". I got fooled because it had some names attached to it. But not,
of course, any name for the actual originator. Someone just sent me a
copy of the same story, except that the evil corporate greedheads involved
were Mrs. Field's, not N-M. That version had a mailing date in 1986.

No prob, Chuck.  I wasn't gonna print the cookie recipe, but I'm glad to
print your mea culpa.  This legend goes all the way back to the "Waldorf
Astoria Velvet Cake" legend of the 40s and 50s and the more recent "Mrs.
Fields' Cookie Recipe" of the early 80s.  Interestingly enough, these
legends usually have pretty good recipes.

&gt;From Californians For Earthquake Prevention:
&gt; "...So, to prevent earthquakes, slow down, take time to smell the roses,

Unfortunately, in California, this is illegal, as is
passing on the left.            :-)

Somebody beat me to the obvious suggestion that because of the higher
incidence of pet disappearances preceding an earthquake, that if all
pet owners would only do their part (as I do) to keep their animals at
home, these earthquake-inducing mass pet-migrations could be prevented.

    I had the good fortune to catch the editor of "Foreign Policy" on
    Headline News the other night.  There are two tony foreign-pol
    journals, this one, which is tall and skinny and gray, and "Foreign
    Affairs", which is not tall and skinny.  The editor went way, waaay,
    out on a limb, saying "I think it's safe to say that Europe is at a
    turning point."

    So, I called (202) 456-7639 to support the Chinese students in their
    desire to remain in the US long enough for things to cool down at home.

    It turns out this is the number of the "White House Opinion Hotline" or
    some such.  You get a robot voice telling you to wait, followed by no
    insipid music, just silence, and then a real live person comes on and
    accepts your opinion.

    I said, "I'd like to encourage the President to sign the bill allowing
    the Chinese students to stay in the United States and escape
    repression."  She answered, "I'll tell him."  Maybe she did tell him,
    but he didn't sign it, a/k/a pocket veto.  The Bush position is that
    the students can individually petition the State Department for an
    extension and it will be granted.  Signing the bill would be an affront
    to his old pal Deng.  The US doesn't want to offend.

    In the meantime, Norway said, "We don't care what the Chinese think,
    we're giving the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama."

    In the meaner time, Bush who ran against Willie Horton's furlough, has
    furloughed a whole Willie Horton government by sending his hosannah
    crew to tell the Chinese their six month probabation for Tiananmen
    Square is over.  Coincidentally, any other government that might be
    looking forward to having a massacre of its own if glasnost doesn't
    somehow lead to perfect perestroika has just gotten some pretty useful
    hints from the Bush furlough experts.

    Is this what they mean by quality?  It must run pretty deep.  Audio
    magazine reported this month on the electrical resistance of auto
    bodies.  Car hi-fi is often grounded back through the body. The least
    resistance was a tie between Saab and Maserati at 0.98 milliohm
    (0.00098 ohm).  The most resistance was from a Fiat 6.1 miliohm
    (0.00610 ohm).  Fix it again, Tony.

                                    =*=

    So, here we are at the end of another one, one that wound up being
    finished on a Monday.  Guess what almost got finished on Friday.

    This time, I promise, another one's coming real soon, definitely before
    Christmas, so, wishing you a Happy New Year, I remain,
