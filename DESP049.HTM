about commas and also computer poetry:

       "I was working on the proof of one of my poems all morning and
        took out a comma.  In the afternoon I put it back in."

I've been spending a great deal of time flipping through radio
stations during my 35-minute commute every morning and evening.  I
can't decide if WBCN or WCOZ is my speed.  I also have mornings
when I can't STAND Charles Lacquidera.

But this morning I heard what I think has to be the epitome of the
ability to "think on one's feet".

Charles Lacquidera is on from 6AM to 10AM on WBCN and one of the more
popular aspects of his BIG MATTRESS program is to call people on
their birthdays or anniversaries, as recommended by relatives and
friends.  This morning Charles called the Riley family in Dorchester
and started his usual spiel when Mrs. Riley answered the phone on her
25th anniversary.  He said that he was from the Greater Boston Adoption
Center, that the Amerasian twins she ordered had come in last week
and why hadn't she come in to pick them up?

Without missing a beat, she responded, " I've been busy...".

Subject: A wonderful new book.

A highly recommended new book for all Desparados:

                "A Dictionary of Bad Manners"
                           by
                      London Ganning

                (Published by Houghton Mifflin)

This book, in the great tradition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary and
Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary is one of the most witty and
acerbic books I have ever come across. Selections appeared in the
most recent Kenyon Review. Here's a sample:

        ABILENE SWADDLE. The drapping or wrapping of the toilet
        seat with a thick protective layer of tissue.

        Always something of a surprise to encounter, one wonders
        at the indelible warning the person's mother must have
        given, more than at the obvious patience - the grace under
        pressure - that allowed him to construct this marvel of
        protective ingenuity while in the grip of nature. But
        the Abilene Swaddle, when encountered as it usually is in
        a public convenience, carries with it a double stigma
        whose seriousness soon dispels any frivolous reflections.
        It confirms the unavoidable suspicion that that which you
        stand before is vile, filthy, contaminated; and that it is
        a fool's trick to be caught out in public off your guard -
        that you should not have allowed this to happen to yourself!
        More, it poses an unpleasant question. How will you
        approach the matter now as YOUR time nears? Will you yourself
        Swaddle, will you chance an unprotected seat, will you perhaps
        fall between two stools and succumb to the ignominy of using
        someone else's Swaddle? Needless to say, the Abilene Swaddle,
        when found intact on the seat, collapsed on the floor as if
        someone had unwound the entire roll (often the case), or
        half-canted into the central harbor and drawing moisture
        with a syphonlike effect up onto that which you may be
        about to rest upon, fills an unpleasant experience with base
        and repugnant deliberations.

        If the Abilene Swaddle occurs in your own quarters when you
        are the host, perpetrated by a person who knows you well,
        and is left there as a reminder to those who do not that
        your residence is usually on a par with the legendary Sit-go
        service station on abandoned Route 18 north of Abilene,
        there is only one adequate response. Remove the seat
        immediately with Swaddle intact, and at a later hour carefully
        finish the job of gift wrapping. And send it to the
        perpetrtor's mother at Christmas, recording date, place, and
        circumstances, and advising her how best to preserve the
        Swaddle, so that she can place it over the mantel with the
        other accumulated trophies and photographs, or on some fond
        wall as a cheerful reminder in her old age that her child
        journeyed through this world carefully, cleanly,
        circumspectly.

                  INVASION OF THE TOOL-MONSTERS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: ELMO::DELPHI::MILLER       "Sue Miller"
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER
Subject: managers and computers

An interesting letter appeared in the Wall Street Journal in
in response to an earlier article:

  "Removing computer use from management level and replacing it in
   the labor level is an act of mature judgment and just simply
   good management...

  "To be the effective tool it is, computer use must remin in the
   labor level.  Skilled and knowledgeable mechanic-users (sic)
   must ever be alert to the potential and capriciousness of this
   remarkable invention; to act and react to its vicissitudes; to
   handle, adjust, manipulate, as skilled pilots their machines.
   Otherwise, this tool-monster will assert itself right into the
   president's chair, assuming total control and requiring complete
   obedience and resulting inevitably in another Babel."

I must admit, fellow desperadoes (or whatever you prefer to be
called), that I was fascinated.  Something obviously inspired that
letter writer to a certain level of paranoia.  I quickly dug through
my old Wall Street Journals and found the source of his inspiration.

The article (February 7, 1983, Manager's Journal, WSJ) was written by
Jack Falvey, a "consultant based in Londonderry, N.H."  As is true of
many things, the article had some valid points; it also had some
incredibly inane statements.  Underneath it all, the article
represents a rather passive and isolationist approach to life and
management, as well as an unwillingness to provide leadership and
direction.  Here's a chance for a potential computer user to speak out
strongly for what he would like, but instead he retreats and decides
to wait until somebody else provides the "user friendliness" he wants.

The article started out, obnoxiously enough,

  "Real men don't eat quiche.  Real women don't pump gas.  And
   real managers don't use computer terminals."

He mentions some people who refuse to use computers, including Ray
Moritz, vice president of service for Computervision, and then
continues with fallacious analogies.  For example, he says that
computer literacy is not important.  After all, one doesn't go to auto
engineering school just to drive a car, therefore one doesn't need to
know how computers work.  However, he neglects to mention that if one
wants to go anywhere in the car, one should learn how to drive, and
should know terms such as brake, tires, shift, rear-view mirror,
clutch, steering wheel, and so on.  Similiarly one needs some
instruction and computer literacy to use a computer.

One of the more simple-minded (and offensive) statements was:

  "But the key word is tool, i.e., something a laborer uses to
   produce results."

He portrays a manager as "managing" others who are responsible
for producing results.  He says,

  "Instant information in the hands of a manager is actually
   dangerous."

Today's WSJ also had an article on a California couple, the Williams,
who write computer games.  Mrs. Williams says,

  "These games appeal to people like me who just don't feel
  comfortable around a computer."

Perhaps Mr. Falvey should take up "Frogger" and "Mystery House".

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
That's okay.  A week before that, the WSJ had an article urging chief
executives and mucky-mucks to get themselves a terminal and start
poking around in the corporate data base.

Well, when ANIMAL::T_LEBOFFE first asked me to list her hamsters for
free, I ignored the request, but she wrote me again and pinned me down.
Why was I not running her hamster giveaway?  This time I responded
politely with a note to the effect that I did not want Desperado to
turn into a hamster dumping ground, which was true.  Well, you can't
rebuff ANIMAL::T_LEBOFFE, it seems, for she responded with another
copy of the damned hamster giveaway along with some responses she had
gotten by sending the thing around in her own area.  But that doesn't
mean I want to turn Desperado into a hamster dumping ground.  Not
coneys, either.

                            A RECOLLECTION

About nine years ago, when I lived in Minneapolis, I  got  to  know  a
very,  very  bright  gentleman  named  Bill.  He was a former minister
(Baptist, I think) who taught chemistry  at  one  of  the  many  small
Christian colleges in the area, and a well accomplished polymath.

We crossed paths  many  times  before  becoming  friends.   He  played
tournament  bridge, as do I, and I often ran into him at University of
Minnesota evening computer science classes.  For a time, Bill and  his
wife  Karen  lived  in  an apartment down the hall from mine, and they
often invited me over.

I had all but forgotten about my friend until the past weekend.  I was
cleaning  out a storage room, preparing to set up a home terminal work
area, and found a dog-eared,  faded,  generally  bedraggled  piece  of
looseleaf paper that Bill had torn from his notebook during one of our
bull sessions.

In this conversation he had declared that he could  prove  Heaven  was
hotter  than  Hell.   The  paper  scrap contained the substance of his
argument.  I now relay it to you, with added commentary  and  literary
cosmetics.

One can estimate the ambient temperature of Heaven  rather  precisely,
according to Bill, from information in the Bible.  Isaiah 30:26 reads:

     "Moreover the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the
     Sun  and  the  light  of  the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the
     light of seven days."

Therefore (according to Bill), Heaven receives radiation from the Moon
equal  to  what  the earth receives from the Sun.  In addition, Heaven
receives radiation from the Sun in seven times seven, or 49, times the
amount the earth does.  That is to say, 50 times as much in all.

(Please note that I am personally  impelled  to  interpret  the  verse
differently.   The phrase "as the light of seven days" seems (to me) a
clarifying reiteration, not a multiplier.  In  Bill's  judgement,  the
text  preceding  the  phrase  is so explicit that the writer could not
possibly have felt a need for further clarification;  hence the  first
"seven"  must  refer  to  light  intensity,  and  the  second to light
duration.  The protean  nature  of  Biblical  semantics  is  generally
conceded  by  Biblical scholars and laypersons alike, and indeed, even
revered by many.  I feel obliged, at least for the sake  of  argument,
to accede to Bill's more practiced and refined interpretive judgement.
He is, after all, an ordained minister.)

The combined radiation of the Moon and the Sun falling on Heaven  must
heat  it  to a point of thermal stasis, such that the heat gained from
radiation equals the heat lost by radiation.

Now we can apply the Stefan-Boltzman fourth-power formula  to  compute
absolute temperature as a function of radiation:

                        4
             (  H / E  )  = 50

where H is the absolute  temperature  of  Heaven,  E  is  the  nominal
absolute   temperature   of   earth   (300  Kelvin),  and  50  is  the
previously-established ratio of the two radiation  values.   In  other
words,  the  absolute  temperature of Heaven (H) is the fourth root of
(50 x 300**4), approximately 798 Kelvin (525 degrees Celcius).

We cannot compute the exact temperature of Hell, but it clearly can be
no  greater  than  the  boiling  point of molten sulfur, or brimstone.
Revelations 21:8 says:

     "But  the  fearful,   and   unbelieving   ...(and   assorted
     baddies)...  shall have their part in the lake which burneth
     with fire and brimstone:  which is the second death."

Hell contains a "lake" of brimstone;  thus, its  temperature  must  be
less  than  the  temperature  at which sulfur turns from a liquid to a
vapor, approximately 445 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, Bill concludes, Heaven is hotter than Hell.

Subj:   a user's review of the Pro

&gt;From cwruecmp!pjd Thu Feb 17 09:09:38 1983
Subject: PRO 350 (prelim) review.
Newsgroups: net.micro

Case Institute of Technology has established a personal computing
laboratory for its students which will consist of fifty DEC PRO 350
computers with a local network connection to a VAX 11/730 file server.
Twenty-five 350's will be distributed among the various departments
and dorms.

The first ten of our 350's were delivered yesterday. I had the
opportunity to spend a day with a 350 (256 Kbytes RAM, 5 Mbyte Seagate
Winchester, 2 floppies) and here are some preliminary comments:

1. Assembly was a snap. The elapsed time from tearing open the cartons
to an installed operating system was 2 hours. The only slightly tricky
operation occured when installing the floating point adapter. The main
system board slides in easily except for the last centimeter. You need
to push on it a little bit to compress the "grounding springs" between
the disk units and the options box.

2. Internally, 1/3 of the volume is power supply! The disks occupy
most of the remaining 2/3's. The main system board resides under the
disks and the options box. The keyboard, system box and monitor
consumed most of the area on my standard size desk.

3. Directions to install hardware and software are explicit -- almost
reminiscent of Army training manuals. No problems were encountered
while initialing the Winchester with P/OS, Prose (the editor) or the
on-line tutorial.

4. The on-line tutorial is moronic. Responses to the Help key and the
P/OS user's guide are clear and very well-written. (Cheap shot:
Commodore, whose documentation I rate as the worst in the personal
computing market, could take some lessons here.)

5. I like the keyboard. At first, I would occasionally hit the Compose
Character key at the lower left corner of the keyboard. But, I quickly
broke this habit. The keys have a nice feel, and the cursor, Help, Do,
etc. grouping is particularly nice. When cruising rapidly through the
tutorial, my right hand would get a little tired since it was
constantly poised over the Do key. When typing prose, my hands felt
extremely comfortable, sometimes resting on the base area below the
space bar.

6. The display is crisp and can be read in strong ambient light. The
display was facing a window at my back and it was a sunny day in
Cleveland so, ..... (A sunny day in Cleveland? Yes, we do get sun
here.) In 132 column mode, the characters appear squished together,
but are surprisingly readable!

7. Moving between menu pages was sometimes a pain due to several long
delays while a new page was being fetched and then drawn. In some
cases, a page was unnecessarily redrawn adding to my annoyance. When
installing an application program from disk, it can be placed at one
of two menu levels -- either at the top or one level down from the
top.

8. The editor, Prose, was installed at the top level. I am an Emacs
enthusiast (mea culpa) and I found Prose VERY easy to learn although
somewhat limited in capability. It can be learned without reading the
manual just by trying random combinations. It has some nice human
interface features, e.g., regions are emphasized in bold so you know
what is about to get deleted or moved. DEC has implemented file
version numbers -- hurray! Since this is the modern world, multiple
directories are also available.

Overall comments. I am favorable impressed. For first time users, it
is almost impossible to screw up! We have now uncrated, assembled and
tested three units, and none of them has failed. When we have a chance
to try the UCSD Pascal system and PRO/Basic and to run some
benchmarks, we will issue another report.
