 I caught an interview with Neon Deion Prime Time Sanders, the ultraman,
 who was promoting a game, featuring himself, called Prime Time.  "The game
 is named after you.  How cool is that?" said the fawning but hip
 interviewer.  "It's cool," allowed Deion.

   Some comments from a customer:

     &gt;
     &gt;
     &gt;&gt; To: support@odi.com
     &gt;It is frustrating to look up a topic in the index of the reference
     &gt;manual especially, because there are about 50 pages of items that
     &gt;begin with "os".  These should be removed to a separate index so
     &gt;that there would be an ObjectStore item index and a normal index.
     &gt;
     &gt;The way it is now, you have to flip through pages and pages of
     &gt;things that begin with o to get to where you really want to go.
     &gt;This may sound trivial but I look up things in the index several
     &gt;times a day, and the o section gets me every time.
     &gt;

     &gt;

This is an interesting complaint, the first of its kind I've seen.
We'll consider this after R4.0; in the meantime, the customer must
accept that in the refman index, os hits happen.

Furthermore, in my mad haste to switch CDs, I dragged the Inside Mac
CD-ROM icon to the trash and when the Mac ejected it, the tray pushed a
glass of grape juice off my desk and into my lap. Let that be a lesson to
development tool vendors: all this would have been avoided with better
documentation.

     I'M LOOKING FOR INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION FROM SOME GOOGOLMEISTER

subject: googols and googolplexes

someone even more mathematically pedantic than i am will probably
have mentioned this already, but just in case...

   From: tompar@world.std.com (Tom Parmenter)

   The googol is "a one with 100 zeroes after it", that is, "10 to the
   hundredth power".  A googolplex is "a googol multiplied times itself a
   googol times", that is, "a googol to the googolth power".

The googolplex has always been one of my favorite "weird 'n huge"
numeric figures, so I cannot stand to see it misquoted. :-)

A googolplex is 10 to the power of a googol:

          100
        10
      10

The number you specify might be called an "exponentiated" googol,
or a googolgoogol:

                (10 ^ 100)
      (10 ^ 100)

now for really huge (though still picayune compared with aleph 0),
try the "exponentiated" googolplex, or googolplexgoogolplex:

                       (10 ^ (10 ^ 100))
      (10 ^ (10 ^ 100))

this is best taken with a large glass of water a googol hours
before eating.

Forwarded message from Ronni Rosenberg:

In the world of competitive charcoal-lighting, "pretty good" does not
cut the mustard.  Thus, Goble hit upon the idea of using - get ready -
liquid oxygen.  This is the form of oxygen used in rocket engines;
it's 295 degrees below zero and 600 times as dense as regular oxygen.
In terms of releasing energy, pouring liquid oxygen on charcoal is the
equivalent of throwing a live squirrel into a room containing 50
million Labrador retrievers.  On Gobel's World Wide Web page (the
address is http://ghg.ecn.purdue.edu/), you can see actual photographs
and a video of Goble using a bucket attached to a 10-foot-long wooden
handle to dump 3 gallons of liquid oxygen (not sold in stores) onto a
grill containing 60 pounds of charcoal and a lit cigarette for
ignition.  What follows is the most impressive charcoal-lighting I
have ever seen, featuring a large fireball that, according to Goble,
reached 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  The charcoal was ready for cooking
in - this has to be a world record - 3 seconds.

 I channel-surfed into the midst of the national junior varsity cheerleader
 competition last night. While the young ladies are leaping about, climbing
 atop one another and being tossed up high, they are accompanied by
 spotters, intense young guys whose duties this championship day seemed to
 consist entirely of looking up the the cheerleaders' skirts.  Innocently
 seeking the inner boundaries of sexist humor, I remain
