when you say "mega is millions, giga is billion, and tera is trillions",
whose million/billion/trillion are you referring to?  American or
British/other country's?  In America Billion means 1 followed by 9 zeros;
in Britain BILLION means 1 followed by 12 zeros.  This makes things
interesting when Americans talk to British people about money, computer
IO etc.

I was always under the impression that a Terabit memory was 10**15
bits.  I realize that there is no officially recognized prefix for
10**12 and 10**15.  Perhaps other Desperados can shed additional light
on this bit of trivia.

I meant American billions and trillions.  Who knows more about
billions and trillions than Americans?  Perhaps both these queries are
the same.  As for the actual definition of terabit, I asked a passing
engineer.  I did look up "tera" in Webster's (III); it's a Greek word
meaning "three".

Tom, I have to agree with your assessment of poetry, that the words must
carry maximum, not minimum freight.  In support of this argument, I offer a
short poem that I saw recently, one written by a young man whose lover was
murdered:

        My love, the world has stolen you away
        With evil, brutal pain.  I know that you
        Did not depart with freely given will.
        My life was touched by sweetly shared amour,
        And never shall you wander far away
        From thoughts and dreams of time we shared in joy.
        You touched my heart and left me richer than
        I should by rights have been.  I won't forget.

I have a copy of this poem because it so exquisitely expresses the feelings
associated with the discovery of such a tragedy.  I was very much moved by
it.  Anyway, note the subtle things, like the assurance (for himself, likely)
that her death was not suicide, and the use of "shall" in the second person
and "will" in the first person, both usages implying determination rather than
simple statement.  Poetry is NOT possible for computers to write; the best that
a machine can produce is a string of words that fit a metrical structure and
just MIGHT happen to make some sort of sense.

More rock 'n' roll news from all over, this time from the wires of United
Press International, as reported in Tuesday's Globe:

NAIROBI, Kenya -- A woman has sued a local rock 'n' roll band for
defamation for a song that likens her to "a hen with no fixed address."

The hit song, by the Kerage Success band, also said the woman ate an
entire cow by herself in four days.

Prisca Kerubo, 27, claimed in papers filed before a Kisii district court
that the song, entitled "Prisca Kerubo," defamed her, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported yesterday.

The suit calls for unspecified damages and demands the record be banned.

Subject: Regarding the naming of animals: anything but this!!

I went cross country skiing last Sunday, hoping to escape the world of bits
and bytes for a few hours.  I was gliding down a gentle incline through a
grove of pine trees covered with snow, gawking at the crystalline splendor of
it all, when I heard a man off in the distance calling his dog:

        "Here TECO, here TECO, come on boy!!"

I immediately turned around and headed in the other direction, but it
was too late.  The image of rustic beauty had been shattered.  Is there
no end to people's depravity in the matter of naming their pets?

A small publisher brings out "The Official Government Nuclear Survivors'
Manual: Everything That Is Known About Effective Procedures in Case of
Nuclear Attack."  The book is intentionally blank inside, but, according
to Publishers Weekly, one store returned its copies on the assumption
the printer had erred.
