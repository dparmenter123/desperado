        A parable about management:  When Columbus was sailing west into
        the unknown, he kept two sets of navigation data.  He minimized
        the distances travelled in his reports to the crew so they
        wouldn't feel so far from home, but kept accurate records of his
        observations for his private calculations.  Historians have worked
        over these numbers and determined that the false figures given to
        the crew for morale purposes were more accurate than the true
        figures Columbus kept for scientific purposes.

And if you don't like Texas, try Florida.  I recently had reason to ask what
the residency requirements for that state were.  The answer (according to a
Florida lawyer) was "intent" and a registered automobile.  I don't think a
mailing address was a requirement, but I don't remember off the top of my head.

I recently wrote this rather lengthy bit about my evil dealings with
the Department of Employment and Training in response to a friend who
had asked me how I was dealing with being between jobs, occupationally
challenged, and otherwise on the dole.  I saved it, thinking that it
might be amusing for the next Desperado -- as if you don't have enough
back material!  (Well, probably.)

I considered, as a joke, putting my resume at the end; I decided it
would be entirely too tacky.

Enjoy!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        There I sat in my bedroom being told over the phone that, after
four weeks of doing not a hell of a lot and getting paid for it, they
realised they overhired and my services were, well, you know.

        What was my parting consolation gift?  "Don't worry, you're
eligible for unemployment."

        Let me tell ya.  Unemployment Insurance is misspelled on all
the forms and all the signs: it's really spelled "13 WEEK FREE RIDE".
If you are a real apple-pie-eating red-blooded Amurric'n citizen, you
will naturally try to avoid UI and just plug away at finding the next
job, one in a series, collect them all.  On the other hand, if you're
like me, and you're the kind of person who used to say "Ah, let the
Russians invade, just so it's OVER", who has "LAZY" written all over
your face in Japanese, *that* kind, then you will quickly realise that
the Unemployment office is just like a big ATM and you never have to
make a deposit.

        Never mind that waiting in the pay line is only slightly
cheerier than being at an abortion clinic; never mind the mindnumbing
paperwork that typifies all government dealings; never mind the robotic
civil servants that typify all government dealings (and who wouldn't
be, after too many years of saying "May I have your social security
number? Have you filed before?  Have you worked the past 52 weeks?"
over and over again).  UI is a *dream*.

        Keep in mind that the first 13 weeks before the Federal
extension -- if you qualify for the extension, if there even IS an
extension in effect -- are paid for by taxes on the employer (if the
employer paid the taxes, that is; some put it into a private fund and
some just don't put it at ALL), so really you *aren't* being a total
leech on the welfare state.  Your friends will try to make you feel
guilty; they're just jealous because you're getting to watch "ABC World
News Now" from 1am until sunrise and then eating Pop-Tarts for
breakfast at 3pm and *they're* *not*.  Hit them once upside the head
with all the forms you've received from the Department of Employment
and Training, and continue feeling good about being paid to slough off
all day.

        Incidentally, don't you love that name?  "Department of
Employment and Training".  No matter how much they shove those words in
your face, everyone *still* calls it "Unemployment".  Sure, DET sounds
better, and doesn't remind you that you're one of the bumming losers
who got laid off -- or worse, fired by a kind boss who lied to the DET;
we all know it happens, and hell, if I were a boss, I'd probably do it
too -- but it has about the same effect as Cambridge painting THE WORKS
on the sides of garbage trucks.  They're *still* big ugly garbage
trucks, no matter how cool the logo is.

        If you're very lucky, and you manage to have either a lot of
savings or low rent and few bills (I'm the latter, with no rent, in
fact), your 13 weeks of UI are a paid vacation from reality.  The days
become shorter and shorter as you rise later and later; the concept of
a job becomes fuzzier and fuzzier as you find your days suddenly
crammed with things to do -- you begin to wonder how you *ever* had
time to do ANYTHING when you had a job.  Being laid off (or fired by a
kind boss) suddenly becomes the best thing that ever happened to you.

        You're wondering, no doubt, about the lack of a job search.
Well, you see, the fantastic thing about receiving your unemployment
check is that you get what may well be your one and only chance to
BLATANTLY LIE TO THE GOVERNMENT.  What's more, they PAY YOU FOR IT.
The scam is deceptively simple, and revolves around the following
facts.

        1.) When you get your check every two weeks, they give you
what's called a "WORKSEARCH ACTIVITY SHEET".  This is simply a record
kept by you of all the employers you bugged about a job during the
previous two weeks.  You don't get paid if you don't have the log
filled out for at least 3 employers per week.

        2.) It would take them years to verify each sheet; basically,
they *don't*.

        Are your gears whirring yet?  The second they told me fact #1
and I inferred fact #2, I immediately had my plan of action.  That's
right; I spent two weeks having an absolute ball, and the day before I
went for my check, I took the Sunday want ads, and filled in the log
with companies who were advertising.  Voila, a check.

        Of course, all good things come crashing down in a real messy
heap of ugly looking gunk and masking tape.  No, I wasn't caught; it's
that this week was number 13.  I've just applied for the extension
which, as hinted at before, only exists if the jobless rate stays above
a certain level; in this case, 7%.  Right now it's 7.8%, but if it dips
below that for 3 months, the extension goes away and you are left high
and dry.  Of course, the chances are that if it goes that low, you'll
actually get employed somehow or another.  The helpful and friendly
folks at Unemployment are trying their hardest to make sure you *are*
employed somehow or another, though... even if you never operated a
drill press before, in all your days of accounting.

        On the extension, you get classified as having job prospects
that are either "good" or "not good" -- gotta love those shades of
gray, eh?  If you go for 4 weeks without any leads, you get classified
as "not good" and then (this is the good bit) if *any* and I mean *ANY*
job comes along that they know you've been offered in writing, and it's
above the minimum wage and your weekly benefit rate, YOU MUST TAKE IT.
This means that if there's a job operating a Spam-folding dingus, and
your interview goes well and they offer it to you in writing, you MUST
accept it -- even though you have a Ph.D. in physics.  Failure to do so
means you LOSE and it's goodbye Charlie, weekly-check-wise.

        The loophole in this otherwise ghastly sounding uberplan is
that the threat only works if the prospective employer actually TELLS
Unemployment that they offered you a job and that you refused it.  If
five places refuse you during the week and one makes you an offer you
can well refuse, you certainly don't have to tell the DET about that
one.

        The extension only lasts 26 weeks; after 9 months of sustained
lounging about and vaguely worrying about being exposed as the cheap
and shameless fraud that you are, you will be more than itching to get
back to the workplace.  It's only been 13 weeks for me and Lord knows I
am, at least part time; I decided to return to college this year to get
that elusive degree, so classes are a large part of the day.  This has
made looking for work even more difficult and easier to avoid thinking
about, since any place that would want to hire me full-time wouldn't
generally want me in school half the day, and most part-time places are
fully staffed at this point in the summer.

        During this generally calm, paid, extended leave of absence
from everyday life, though, there is plenty of time for rumination on
exactly what people (politicians, mostly) call "abuses of the system".
I don't find the first 13 weeks of unscrupulous lying to be an abuse.
Naughty, yes; lying, most certainly.  However, the money received was
paid by the employer for just such a case, and since it doesn't come
from taxes on the general public, I ain't sweatin' it.

        As for the federal extension -- well, yes, I will feel a twinge
of conscience if I go overboard about fibbing.  I plan to actually send
out resumes -- of course, if I send them out to companies in towns I
can't get to, for jobs I'm underqualified for, I'll still get my lucre
without having to work for it.  The American work ethic certainly does
have an interesting dichotomy: slave hard all day for your money, but
everyone wants to win the lottery.

By the way, I highly reccomend ABC World News Now.  It picks up
marvelously from where NBC News Overnight left off; that slow, lazy
feeling of mellow news with interesting features and realistic
commentary.  Kind of like "All Things Considered" with pictures and
more ads.  Those of you with jobs will just have to tape it and watch
it when you get home, I suppose...

Subj:   Why are these people laughing?

Recently I noticed that my life wasn't funny enough, so I started watching
comedy shows on late night TV.

There's a lot of comedy around now, even a 24-hour comedy channel. But the more
comedy there is, the less funny it is. The law of physics about the speed of
light seems also to limit the amount of funny that can exist. All these
comedians, trying so hard to be the next who, Red Buttons?  David Brenner?
Desperate to get picked for a part in the next comic masterpiece like Who's
the Boss or Facts of Life.

The material smacks of the frenetic mimicry that passes for wit among
high-school kids joking around in school hallways. The laughter even has that
similar peer-pressure-enforced extra loudness to it.

You never see comedians die on stage anymore. Judging from the audience
reaction, all jokes by all comedians are equally hilarious. Isn't it odd?  Why
is this, nitrous oxide in the ventilation system? The audience is a living
laugh track, trained from an early age to react like Ed McMahon, responding in
loyal HAW HAW HAW fashion to anybody wearing a trendy baggy double-breasted
suit, holding a mike and cracking wise no matter how feebly. The audience so
reliably easy to please because they're so delighted to be in on the making of,
you know, TV! Or maybe they're paid, like their counterparts in the 30-minute
infomercials. Whatever the reason, there's no risk involved anymore. Instead,
we get the corporately-generated merriment of canned laughter done by real
canned people. A marvel of technology.

Each comedian is only on for a few minutes, so they only tell about ten jokes,
and let the crowd fill in the gaps with photogenic laughter. Comedy clubs are
where all the demographically correct people you see in beer commercials go for
their evening's entertainment.

And of course demographics dictates the obligatory close-ups of some of these
glamorous beer-commercial-type babes in the front row! Gotta reach the poor
sorry-assed Dilberts, wishing they were out at a comedy club drinking Lite Beer
from Miller and having a GOOD TIME, in the center of the ideal Lite Beer from
Miller demographic crowd, instead of out at the perimeter in their polyester
shirts and bad haircuts, rotting in front of their living room TV...

Dilbert on couch, daydreams: They think this guy is funny, and they're
attractive. If I think this guy is funny, maybe I'll be attractive too...

Comic #25:    ...if they could just make the condoms big enough!

All:          HAW HAW HAW! (Wild applause.)

Dilbert:      'Scuse me ladies, you think he's funny too? Looks like we
              have something in common, mind if I have a seat?

Comic #25:    ...the kind of burp that's an accidental vomit?

All:          HAW HAW HAW! (Wild applause.)

Babes:        Sure thing, Tarzan, pull up a chair. How about buying us a
              couple of Lite Beers from Miller?

Dilbert:      (Thinks: They drink Lite Beer from Miller, and they're
              attractive. If I drink...)

              Whoa, you mean we have that in common too?! A round of Millers
              for the ladies!

Comic #25:    ...fishing out used condoms from the trash cans at the bus
              station!

All:          HAW HAW HAW! (Wild applause.)

Since they have so little time and talent, they barrel ahead with the unrelated
jokes, no time for introductions or clever lead-ins to other topics, always
time for a bit of Arsenio-style pandering though (you're a good-looking crowd
-- give yourselves a hand!). Then at some random point on the director's signal
the act ends as abruptly as it began with the obligatory closing
"youvebeenagreatcrowd" pander, and the interchangeable comic with his
interchangeable jokes exits to more wild applause, and cut to commercial.

Disillusionment. This isn't 100% pure comedy product after all. They milk jokes
for far more than they are worth, and worse, the mean time between jokes is
much too long. I tried hitting the mute button after each joke, and waiting the
ten seconds or so it takes for the audience to stop its disproportionate
laughter after each remark. But there's no getting around it, this comedy
product is diluted. It's not dense enough. It's Comedy Lite, to go along with
the beer. Too much air in it, like a cheap cheese cake.

Sorry Comedy Central. The more all these sitcom actor wannabes shout and pander
and try and squeeze four jokes out of one, the less funny they are. They try
too hard, poor things. Their rightful place in the world is to be the best joke
tellers in the unemployment line.

So I've given up on comedy. It's no longer a source of funny, if it ever was.
It's time to return to the source. The place to look for funny is back where it
always was, among the writings of people who are trying to be taken seriously
but can only succeed at being ridiculous. Funny Classic.

Good candidates are anything with the word "architecture" in it, executive
summaries, newspaper articles that quote "ethicists", child care experts
explaining what you should tell your children about Pee Wee Herman, college
professors, et cetera. The success of these people as funny comes from their
deep-seated need to be taken seriously. The moment they realize they are funny,
they no longer are. It's kind of a Zen thing, I guess.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Comics don't work their way up to anything any more.  They never
        set a trap back early in the routine so they can catch everybody
        later.  And they never tell long stories anymore.  And, worst of
        all, they never ever have anything resembling a Big Finish.  It's
        always a shock when they're through.

        I heard somewhere that only 30 comedians in the entire United
        States make a living at it.  Can this be true? Can all those
        comedians on all those channels all be one step away from debtor's
        prison?  Wow.

        I always like the juggling comedians and comic magicians and I'm
        almost always a sucker for ventriloquists, but if the comic picks
        up a guitar there are only two likelihoods:

                He can't really play and it will be boring.

                He can really play, but it will be boring.

        There are exceptions.  Robert Klein's blues classic, "I can't stop
        my leg", and the occasional Martin Mull, but if you see Chance
        Langton headed for his guitar, get up and leave the room.

   Is this a mailing list about advertising cigarettes to children? :-)

Actually, that was the first thing I thought of ....

Apropos, given all the fuss about the effectiveness of the "Old Joe"
Camel ads, I'm surprised the obvious counteroffensive hasn't been
implemented by health groups: a truly, revolting, disgusting,
repulsive, wheezing, coughing, gasping cartoon camel.  They're already
one of the most unappealing animals on earth; it'd be a snap to create
a loathsome cartoon version to communicate graphically what smokers
*really* look like.

And speaking of wonderful mailing lists, did I forward this one to you
all?

    Soft music and candlelight only begin to set the scene for a
    perfect date if you have the Atmosphere Manager by Norm
    Automation of Sunnyvale, CA. It can literally create the right
    climate for romance, working, exercising, negotiating, or
    sleeping. This window unit controls the air temperature,
    humidity, amount of fresh air, direction of airflow, light,
    fragrance and, if the room is snugly sealed, the air pressure.
    Five settings adjust these variables for each activity. In
    romantic mode, for example, the lights are dimmed by remote
    light modulator, fresh air is reduced, the temperature and
    humidity are increased slightly, and a soft breeze wafts a scent
    called Rose and Rum through the air. settings for working alone
    or collaborating with others modulate the temperature, humidity,
    and light to keep you alert. The Atmosphere Manager will be
    available in September for $3,995.

Subj:   In California, they license bondage shops

        LOS ANGELES (UPI) -- The owner of an illegal Hollywood bondage parlor
was charged Wednesday with soliciting the murder of a competing licensed
bondage shop owner.
        Michael Neumann, was charged with nine felony counts, including the
solicitation of murder, two counts of arson, and one count of using a
destructive device and explosive, Deputy District Attorney Frank Johnson
said.
        Neumann was also charged with two counts each of solicitation to
commit great bodily injury and solicitation of assault and robbery and
one count of solicitation of arson, he said.
        Neumann, who owns the Ball and Chain on Sunset Plaza, was arrested
Tuesday after police served a search warrant at his Hollywood Hills
home. He was being held on $750,000 bail.
        Johnson said Neumann's unlicensed bondage parlor competes with
several licensed bondage establishments.
        Last year, Neumann allegedly threatened the owner of a licensed
parlor -- Ms. Laura's Dominion in the 8800 block of West Venice
Boulevard. On May 25, 1991 and on July 9, 1991, Ms. Laura's was set on
fire at least once with an explosive device, Johnson said.
        In June, a man approached Betty Giroux, the owner of Ms. Laura's, and
said that he had been hired to kill her, he said.
        Giroux went to the police who began an investigation which culminated
with Tuesday's arrest.
        The search warrant of Neumann's house turned up a machine gun, a
silencer and about 100 other weapons. A small amount of cocaine and
items used in bondage were also discovered at the home, police said.

        LOS ANGELES -- Squadrons of whip-wielding dominatrices with
        black-leather municipal licenses permanently pierced in place
        descended tonight on the unlicensed bondage houses of Hollywood.

        The male clients were easily scattered [natch] but a pitched battle
        between licensed and unlicensed pain-givers did not end until the
        city-approved straps, zippers, whips, and chains began to
        demonstrate their superior staying power.  Licensed Dominatrix
        Cruella deSkille said, "We whipped 'em so bad they got to liking

Subj:   speed bump w/ shoes

   Speaking of "large truck things", I am  reminded of a television
   commercial currently in circulation.  In it, and I have no idea what
   product/theology division this little bag of tripe radiates from, a
   "commuter" is stuck in traffic.  The "commuter" is clearly upset -- the
   type of upset normally reserved for those phone company ads where
   people "share" their "concern" about the possibility of waiting an
   extra nine seconds for a dial tone when they attempt to make one of
   their very important "business" calls to  CHINA in hopes of landing the
   big "death gas" account -- and the words  that come out of the
   "commuters" perfect head, sticking out of the perfect  executive-style
   jumpsuit are (as close as my memory will allow) "I don't believe it. .
   . ANOTHER OVER-TURNED TRUCK!!".  Apparently, this poor woman is plagued
   by "over-turned trucks" -- so much so that this type of accident has
   progressed from a serious-type accident w/ possible injury to the
   driver of the truck into a conspiratorial event.  This attitude
   provides further evidence that although Bush  is currently not doing
   well in the polls, there is still enough  "republican dog food essence"
   in stock to make the election interesting.

But isn't it time to give up this potato thing?  I realize that in the
local dialects we use out here on the edges of the country, the word
"potato" is spelled without an e.  But as any moderately sized
adventure into the Heartland and it's quaint little restaurants will
convince you, a very sizable proportion of American Menu Writers feel
otherwise.  Dan probably grew up seeing it spelled that way.  I'm sure
he can spell, knows numbers above 10, and can dress himself.  The real
problems have absolutely nothing at all to do with these things.  The
problems have to do with the political aganda he represents.  Eight
years of pointing out Reagan's fractured relationship with meaning had
absolutely no effect whatsoever on his ability to get elected.  Is it
my imagination, or are the same people who complain most about the
candidates not talking about "issues" also the ones who still tell
potato jokes three months after they ever had the possibility of being
funny?

--Art

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Yes, Art, but.  The "issue" is "Are we going to get stuck with
        Quayle as president?"  Potatoe jokes are a good way to ask this,
        probably more productive, and certainly more entertaining, than
        George Will and David Broder discussing whether Quayle has
        "sufficient gravitas to shoulder the awesome burdens of the
        nation's highest office".

        The White House rallying cry these days, one of many, equally
        ineffective, is "Quayle:  Not as dumb as you think he is."  I
        imagine this is true.  As I remarked a few Desperados ago, Quayle
        has made more interesting news than the last few Veeps, but, hey,
        he's had four years to impress us.  He hasn't.  He really got
        treated with grotesque unfairness in the recent abortion
        flap/gaffe; however, one of those mistreating him was his wife.

        But, how about the NPR theory that the Dump Quayle movement is a
        "stalking horse" (love that "hustings" talk) for the Dump Bush
        movement?  The dream is a G.O.P. convention with Baker and Kemp
        battling it out with Quayle for the nomination.  Is General Curtis
        LeMay dead?

        George Will was floating the dump-Bush movement the other day,
        with the brilliant characterization of the President's political
        statements as "verbal confetti".

Subj:   There are many intelligent species in the universe, all owned by cats

From: Mike O'Brien &lt;obrien@aero.org&gt;

&gt;&gt; And yes, kiddies, tigers really are as big and poofy and
&gt;&gt; soft as they look, and they purr like a freight train
&gt;&gt; going by.  You don't want to know what it takes to find
&gt;&gt; this out.

&gt;Au contraire.  We're agog.  Galore of agog people faunch to know,
&gt;among them

Well, OK, you find this out by taking one for a walk.  To take a
tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger.  Tigers fresh from the bush
are not recommended for the inexperienced.  What you need is one
who's used to the procedure.  He or she is thus liable to be merely
playful, rather than actively irritated.  You also need a friend,
whom you really, really trust.

The friend carries an apple-wood cane - apple, or some other wood
which will bend under stress rather than shattering.  This friend is
your backup, and the cane is his or her only tool for everything,
from knocking stuff out of the way that the tiger is liable to eat,
to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if things go
wrong.

What YOU carry is a ten-foot length of pass-link chain.  This is your
leash.

Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each
other.  This is important.  You need this so you can hook on a safety
clip.  The chain is looped about the tiger's neck and acks as a giant
choke-chain, but the clip is there to keep a loop of some sort in
case things go badly wrong.  You carry the chain looped in one hand
in a peculiar fashion which permits the whole length of chain to be
dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with it.
You practice this beforehand till you're sure you've got it right.

Then you go into the cage with the tiger.  Your friend does not.  You
gauge the tiger's mood and put the leash on the tiger.  There isn't a
whole lot more to say about this step except to say that that is why
your friend is there, OUTside the cage.  On your side is the fact
that the tiger knows what the leash is for by this time and
presumably is largely in favor of the idea.

This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy.  They are
also much, much larger than you had ever dreamed when you're
standing next to one.

Then you take the tiger for a walk.  Your friend walks in front with
the cane to clear the way.  You walk with the tiger at your side,
keeping pretty good control and letting the tiger know that you are
Paying Attention, because if the tiger thinks you are not Paying
Attention, it will do what housecats do - let you know that you
should be Paying Attention.  Unlike housecats, the tiger is big
enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the
situation.  Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your
legs out from under you is generally considered good enough by most
tigers.  They think this is hilarious.  To this extent, tigers differ
from housecats in that they seem to have a sense of humor.

It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants.  In
this case the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to
stop it.  This is generally done by wrapping the chain around
something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away.  This will slow
it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you and grab the
chain as you go bulleting across the countryside.  The weight of two
adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things
manageable, whereas one will not.

It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around
and turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in
the short term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do.
They enjoy their fun but are generally not ill-tempered.  If they are
they don't get taken for walks.

They also purr like a freight train passing.  Experts in the field
claim that this is not purring, that it means something else, but you
couldn't put it by me.  Sure sounded like purring - at 16-2/3 RPM,
but it sounded like purring.

All in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of
cocktail party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp
for the rest of the day.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Chimpanzees, on the other hand, are not soft and poofy.  I
        understand that if you're backstage at the circus waving your
        apple wand around and shouting "Tiger coming through!", the circus
        folk  will grudgingly move out of the way.  If, on the other hand,
        you yell "Chimp coming through!", the crowd of roustabouts and
        acrobats (and tiger tamers) will part like the Red Sea.

Hi there,

i've got a little problem an i think that here are the right wizard's to help
me with it.
I and some friends of me are hooked on juggling :-))
We are also juggling with torches and spitting fire and so on.
And here's my problem:
First we started to spitt fire with LYCOPODIUM, a fine spore-powder. But it's
verry expensive and doesn't look nice. It's only a dust-explosion with a
verry little flame. Then we asked an professional "fire-spitter" from a
circus. He won't give us the formula of the liquid he was spitting fire with.
But it smelled (and tasted !) like petroleum and so we used verry clean
petroleum for our gig's! But it's verry ugly, it degreases your lips and i've
read that you can get tongue-cancer from it !!!
Only the flames you get are the best you've ever seen. Up to 5 meters long
and a brilliant shine ....
But now we're searching some other stuff. We've tried alcool but it burns
without a coloured flame .... not so good.
I've tried to mix alcool with salty water to get a yellow flame :-(((
But the only effect was that i nearly began to vomit as i took a little
into my mouth ....
Any ideas ??? The best thing would be something verry cheap, non toxic,
and making good looking flames when burning.
I've already tested alcool with glycerine - no coloured flame.

                                       Thanx a lot

        was honored by the communists in the name of their youth
        organization, the DuBois Clubs.  Nixon accused them of naming it
