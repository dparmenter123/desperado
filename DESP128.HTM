The recent examples generally fall in the category of Self-consciously
Cute.  I find rather funnier those used in full innocence, of which
the best example that I can presently cite is a small-time construction
company on Chicago's south side when I was growing up there which
was named after its owner, without blushing at all, simply as

                Sherlock Homes

It was located off 63rd Street, in a neighborhood held by many to
be an urban jungle (its Blackstone Rangers was later among the first
ghetto gangs to gain nationwide noteriety).  The minor relevance of
this is simply that Sherlock Homes was not far from the veterinary
patronized for my family's pets until his retirement, named Dr. Livingston.

I certainly hope that this firm saw its way clear to constructing a
subdivision, the main drag of which they called Baker Street. And if
there was a local rock ensemble, that they were called the Speckled Band.
Further speculation and puns invited, obviously.

Subj:   For the next Beefcake issue of Desperado

Just saw a great ad on the back of "InformationWeek" magazine
(the June 3 issue, if you want to check it out):

A good-looking hunk, wearing a black tuxedo, tie, and cummerbund -
but no shirt - is leaning on a stack of papers and gazing out at the
viewer with an expression on his face that I believe is intended to
be sensuous. (Either that, or earnest and businesslike, but somehow
I doubt it's the latter.) Anyway, this bare-chested, black-haired,
dark-eyed hero is representing - liquor? Cigarettes? Men's underwear?

Nope. The ad is for UCC-4, an inventory package. "You'll lose your
shirt..." if you don't use their product, is the pitch. And here
I was expecting to see something about the sensuous programmer!

At least the guys are getting some equal time now. For years all we
ever saw were those hardware ads featuring long-legged, short-skirted
women lounging all over the keyboards. Now maybe we can have the
bronzed lifeguard checking his terminal for the latest in first-aid tips...

Subj:   What I learned today in court...

From the Jurors Handbook:

        Q. Will I learn anything as a result of being a juror?

        A. As a juror, you will have to make difficult judgments involving
        all of the human passions -- love, hate, greed, anger, etc.  You and
        your fellow jurors are also human.  Certain jurors respond differently
        to one or more circumstances in the case.  There may be good-faith
        differences of opinion among members of your jury during deliberations.
        Through fate, you and your fellow jurors have been brought together in
        search for justice.  Justice means truth and fairness.  You have no
        reason to believe that any other jury in any other place or time would
        do a better job than you will do.  The experiences of centuries teach
        that our system of juries renders fair, impartial, and true verdicts.
        In addition to the performance of an important civic duty, it is
        sincerely hoped that you will learn a good deal about the courts and
        the judicial system.  As has been the case for many jurors before
        you -- the verdict is yours.

Makes ya wanna stand up and salute, don't it?

Subj:   Never eat anything bigger than your head

Kimball Farms serves big portions, eh?  And what about that ad I've heard a
couple of times on the car radio, for some Boston-area restaurant, that touts
portions so big "you'll eat till you bust"?

I'm deeply puzzled by the practice of taking the size of portions as a measure
of a restaurant's (ice cream stand's) quality.  My old friend Nancy did this
often; she'd report to me on a restaurant she'd just visited with buddies:

        Nancy:  I just ate at a really good restaurant!

        Me:     ?

        Nancy:  The salad was so big I almost couldn't finish it, and the
                steak must have weighed a pound and a half!

        Me:     How was the ...

        Nancy:  And they served these tremendous desserts!

        Me:     Yeah, but how was the ...

        Nancy:  And then they served these big chocolates with the coffee!

        Me:     How was the food?

        Nancy:  What do you mean?  I've just been telling you.

        Me:     I mean, did it taste good?

        Nancy:  It was okay.

It's not that I don't appreciate a healthy portion, but deep within I feel that
anyone whose basic judgment about food is its size should probably make a career
in real estate.

                     Why I Don't Like Home Repairs
                                   by
                           Allan C. Wechsler

We were going to repaint our front porch.  The people who owned our
house before us must have been very nautical people, because they
painted the front porch with gray deck paint of the kind you often find
on ships.  If you have ever taken a cruise, you have had some experience
with this kind of paint.  It has remarkable properties that defy the
ordinary laws of friction.  One moment you are standing at the rail,
looking at the waves and wondering whether it's worth the effort to be
sick, and the next moment a gust of wind is blowing you across the deck.
They design it like that for the benefit of passengers who like to play
shuffleboard.  If the deck were not slippery, the shuffleboard puck
would not slide.  These maritime engineers know their priorities.

Our unique porch paint was especially enjoyable in winter, with slush on
it.

"You can't just paint over it," said our next door neighbor, who is
always telling us what to do.  "That's Glasstech Mumblecoat.  The new
paint'll peel right off.  You have to sand off the old paint first."

"Sand it off?  With sandpaper?"  We were beginning to see advantages in
leaving things as they were.

"No, no," said the neighbor.  "Use a belt sander."

When we said we didn't own a belt sander, the neighbor explained to us
that nobody actually owns a belt sander.  By act of Congress, certain
tools may not be owned by individuals but must be rented from hardware
stores.  Wallpaper steamers and belt sanders are both in this category.

We left our car at the hardware store as a deposit, and carried the belt
sander two miles back to the house.  On the way we learned certain
things about belt sanders.  First, they are very heavy.  Second, as you
move them away from their home hardware store, a clever arrangement of
weights, pulleys, springs, and radar ranging equipment causes them to
become heavier slowly.  This is a security measure to prevent dishonest
people from simply leaving their car at the hardware store and skipping
off to Mexico with the far more valuable belt sander.  After one gets
more than fifteen miles from the hardware store, the sander weighs more
than a ton, and one can no longer move it.  The hardware store
dispatches a work crew to go and pick it up.

Luckily, our house is only two miles from the hardware store, so that
when we got it home, it weighed only about a hundred pounds.  We lugged
it up onto the porch, and got ready to begin sanding the deck paint off.
Immediately we encountered a problem: electrical power.  The hardware
store did not have a two-mile extension cord, so we were forced to plug
it in at home.

Unfortunately, our house is wired for 115 volts alternating current at
60 cycles per second, with gusts up to 80.  We tried to plug the sander
in to one of our outlets, but the sander refused to even look at our
electricity.  A shiny plate screwed to the case explained the problem.
The sander would only consume 167 volts reciprocating current at 48
cycles per second, with a slice of lemon.

The man at the hardware store rented us an adapter which would convert
our house current to 141 volts vacillating current at 54 cycles per
second, and said that if we were diplomatic about it, the sander would
meet us halfway.  We left our bicycle at the hardware store and walked
the adapter home, which was difficult because it had to stop at every
tree and fire hydrant.

After an extremely trying time negotiating with our seventeen extension
cords (they all wanted to be the one to plug into the wall, and nobody
wanted to connect to the adapter) we were ready to turn the sander on.
It took us a while to locate the switch.  The engineers hid it under the
handle.  The switch is spring-loaded, and arranged so that the sander
cannot run unless you are holding it in a fashion that reminded us of
certain fraternity handshakes we had learned in college.  The trick is
that you have to nudge the switch away from you with your ring finger.
It was at this point that we began to suspect the sander of being of
extraterrestrial manufacture.

Suddenly a lot of things made sense.  The machine's power requirements
were probably normal for its home planet.  The odd grip and peculiar
switch would have been just right if one had eleven fingers on one hand,
the middle three of which were jointed backwards.  Having seen a
creature with just this sort of hand in the barroom scene in "Star
Wars", the assumption seemed reasonable.  It all fit together.

We were stuck, though.  There probably wasn't another belt sander to be
had in the entire state.  So we made do with duct tape, possibly the
world's most versatile material.  We once owned a television made
entirely of duct tape, but that's another story.  This time, we used the
tape to hold the switch on so that we could operate the sander for more
than ten seconds without our arms becoming paralyzed with cramps that
measured 7.4 on the Richter scale.

We could still turn the sander on and off by plugging and unplugging the
adapter.  When we got it going, it made a very satisfying zuzzing noise
that reminded me of the Indianapolis 500.  The belt spun around and
around and we knew it was working because when we touched the moving
belt we screamed in pain.  This is an infallible indicator of correctly
functioning power tools.

When applied to the porch the belt tended to pull the sander in one
direction, and the sander tended to pull us.  We tried to get traction
by planting our shoes firmly on the porch, but as the assiduous reader
has already realized, this was completely impossible.  It was necessary
to rig an arrangement of clotheslines about the porch to hold on to with
one hand while controlling the sander with the other.  Perhaps
"controlling" is an exaggeration here.

The sander kept trying to get away.  We would let go for a second to
scratch or brush gray paint dust off our clothes, and the sander would
scoot off down the front steps and make for the street.  But it would
soon get to the end of its cord, and one of the seventeen extensions
would give way, unplugging the poor thing and depriving it of power
before it could do more than threaten a couple of neighborhood kids.

Finally, things started to go more smoothly.  We sanded away for about
fifteen minutes, when suddenly we received an enormous electrical shock.
The assiduous reader will have known that this was coming.  In
retrospect, it is all quite obvious.  The sander wanted only 48 cycles
per second, and the adapter was feeding it 54 cycles per second.  The
extra six cycles per second may not seem like much, but over the course
of fifteen minutes this adds up to more than five thousand excess
cycles.  All of these cycles were building up in the sander, and finally
it let loose all at once.  We let go, howling not so much from pain as
from embarrassment that we hadn't seen it in advance.  Well, also from
pain.

At that moment we had the bad luck to have the sander pointed toward the
house.  The sander barrelled into the front door.  We chased it about
the ground floor for ten minutes before it climbed the stairs and tried
to drown itself in the toilet.  I don't remember how we got it back to
the hardware store, but I am told that it is still in therapy, although
it is making progress.  We removed the front porch entirely and put in
tulips, which don't need to be sanded as often.

Printing PSP Information

There have been several requests from users for a method for easily printing
the text portion of the results of a PSP request.  Committed, as I am,
to the utilization of computers for the storage and retrieval of data if
for no other reasons than to preserve our forests and woodlands and to
reduce the amounts of paper occupying otherwise usable space in my office,
home, briefcase, and car, I personally don't see the need for such a
facility.  (Actually, the thing I dislike most about paper is that the 1
percent of it that's worthwhile is never retrievable because of the mess
caused by the other 99 percent.  This may be caused in part by my filing
system, FINO-TIAA, which stands for First In Nothing Out - Throw It All
Away.  A co-worker has frequently complained that if I should happen to get
run over by a truck that she wouldn't be able to find anything.  I
explained, of course, that should I indeed be run over by a truck, I could
care less what she can find.)

However, being in a position where I must bow to public pressure, I will
divulge a technique for doing the above assuming the following:

-  All such listings will be printed on either recycled paper or on pages
   removed from manuals that have "THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK" on
   them.  This means, of course, that the page would no longer be blank
   but then it really wasn't in the first place, was it.  Perhaps we
   shouldn't do that because what they might really mean is "THIS PAGE IS
   INTENDED TO BE BLANK SO DON'T WRITE ON IT".  When time permits, I fully
   intend to examine the source, intent, and effectiveness of this message.
   Incidentally, I also intend to determine why storms in the
   Northern Hemisphere move counter-clockwise and those in the Southern
   Hemisphere move clockwise.  I have an as yet unpublished theory that
   it's because there are more cars in the north, nearly all of which
   drive on the right side of the road.  As these vehicles pass one another
   they establish littly bitty counter-clockwise rotating wind funnels
   that we have all seen in the dirt by the side of the road.  These
   little bitty guys then get together and form tornadoes, hurricanes,
   etc.  I feel sure that we could reduce severe weather by driving on
   alternating sides of the road on alternating days (e.g. odd days on
   the right, even days on the left).  This could potentially present some
   problems around midnight but I have a solution to that also.  Rather
   than all try to switch at once, we would have what is commonly known
   as a "Phased Implementation".  From 00:00 hours 'til 00:15 hours trucks
   traveling north on the right, would move to the left side but continue
   north.  From 00:15 to 00:30, busses.  From 00:30 to 00:45, pickup trucks
   and vans.  From there on, I think everything would work itself out.

-  Under no circumstances shall the output be delivered to, left in,
   mailed to, or in any other manner show up, in my office.  Heaven knows
   I've plenty to do, what with worrying about blank pages, tornadoes
   and the like.

    Computer buffs call it "flaming."  Now scientists are documenting
and trying to explaim the surprising prevalence of rudeness,
profanity, exultation and other emotional outbursts by people when
they carry on discussions via computer.

    Observing both experimental groups and actual working
environments, scientists at Carnegie-Mellon University are comparing
decision-making through face-to-face discussions with those conducted
electronically.  In the experiments, in addition to calling each other
more names and generally showing more emotion than they might face to
face, people "talking" by computer took longer to agree, and their
final decisions tended to involve more risks than those reached by
groups meeting in person.

    As small computers proliferate, business discussions that were
once pursued face-to-face, by telephone or on paper are now taking
place by way of keyboards and video display terminals.

    The unusual characteristics showing up in computer communications
should not be seen as entirely negative, say the researchers.

    Studies of electronic mail in several Fortune 500 corporations
have confirmed the tendency for people to use more informal and
expressive language on the computer than when communicating in person,
by telephone or by memo.

    The company studies also indicate that computers are permitting
much wider participation in discussions than in the past, with
employees far from headquarters now able to follow debates and make
their views known.

    Unusually expressive language has been one of the most striking
characteristics of computer discussions studied in many different
contexts.  "It's amazing," said Kiesler.  "We've seen messages sent
out by managers - messages that will be seen by thousands of people -
that use language normally heard in locker rooms."

latin word "ultrix."

Subj:   someone looked up the meaning of ultrix in a latin dictionary

.

Jon,

Peter and I were curious about the origin of "Umbra", the new system name
for the CSSE 11/730, so I brought in my copy of Lewis and Short's Oxford
Latin Directory (ne plus ultra as far as Latin dictionaries are concerned).

Anyway, to make a long story short, Peter and I decided (chortling) to look
up "ultrix", which is a bona fide Latin word, and THIS is what it said:

ultrix,-icis, adj. [ultor], avenging, vengeful.
              I.  Adj.(poet.): the avenging goddesses
                               [gives references from Vergil and others]
              II.  She that avenges, an avenger
                               [gives a reference from Cicero]

We had always thought that ULTRIX was an "ultra" version of UNIX [tm of AT&amp;T],
but we weren't aware of this other implication.  The question is...whom or
what are we avenging, and against whom???

Subj:   They'll get my water pistol when they pry my cold, dead fingers off it.

        At about 9:15 AM, the fire alarm went off here in LJO2. Most people
        went to the front doors to exit, although a couple of us smart
        guys went out the emergency exit. We saw a Littleton police car
        at each of the two corners of our building we could see.

        When we asked what was going on, we were told to stay where we
        were. One of the system architects (known for doing what he wants)
        walked right past the cop to the front of the building with the
        rest of the people.

        (When Barry Jame Folsom was here, a number of software engineers
        [and Folsom himself] bought some OUZI machine gun water pistols.)

        All the hoopla here started when a security guard saw an
        engineer walking in with his OUZI machine gun water pistol covered
        with a towel and thought it was the real thing. Subsequently,
        all the water pistol owners have left the building to take there
        hardware (?) to their cars.

I know you've all seen it, but who could resist that SUBJ:? Anyway,
this was not only interesting news, and THE social event of the season, but
also an interesting Desperado phenomenon. I received eight copies of this
within two hours, including one from the dear departed Mr. Parmenter.

Subj:   Would this require an on-site?

Here's an item from Computerworld:

"SYDNEY -- The first system crash happened at the New South Wales Health
Department before the agency even switched on its brand new Digital Equipment
Corp. VAX 8600.  After delivery to the site, the VAX 8600 system crashed
through the floor of the computer room and narrowly avoided plunging out a
window, sources reported.  The department, which had the computer room built
by a third party rather than DEC, fortunately had opted for DEC's insurance
plan.  DEC Pty. Ltd. replaced the damaged machine within a week, a spokesman
said.  The embarrassed health department is presently conducting an
investigation into the cause of the accident."

I wonder if there's a patch for this one...

Obviously a vampire cat. My comfort is that this will send Mr. Parmenter into
paroxysms, inasmuch as he assured me his one reservation about this whole
succession question was the cat icon. By now, of course, he must have others.

Next issue: what I did on my summer vacation! In the tradition of Richard
Hakluyt, Baron Munchausen, Lowell Thomas and Per Hamnqvist, I'll tell the
tale of the last three weeks on tour with the Nashua Choral Society. Don't
miss it!
