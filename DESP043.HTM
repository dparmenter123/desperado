 DESPERADO, in remembrance of my father, Bill Parmenter

                       AN ENGINEER'S LIFE

My father died January 10 at the age of 78.  He saw Halley's comet
in 1910 and he always intended to see it again.  I understand it
won't be as bright in 1986 as it was when he saw it.

Although not on the net and not a regular reader, my father was a
major influence on Desperado.  He and I carried on a long dialogue
about language.  I sent him a birthday gift last month of a book
called "American Tongue and Cheek".  The book takes the view that
our language is going to change regardless of the best efforts of
purists.  My father was a purist.  I had been intending to review the
book for Desperado, but here is my father's review instead:

"I found 'American Tongue and Cheek" immediately challenging.  I
appreciate your giving me gifts out of the now world (adverb used as
adjective, first used by King Cnut in 986 edition of the Domesday
Book).  This man Quinn [the author] calls all our heroes pop
etymologists; I think hes's one himself, a self-appointed one.  (Not
that I don't agree with him most of the time.)  You can find an
example of almost any usage if you search diligently enough.  Some
examples are execrable and one should have the privilege of saying so
and avoiding them.  It doesn't bother me that opera is a Latin plural
when so obviously it is an English sinugular, however it annoys me for
people to give 'octopi' as plural when it's a bastard word with a
Latin tail on a Greek body.  Better say octopusses.  Fowler [of 'Modern
English Usage' fame and a hero to my entire family] was right when he
said to avoid foreign words unless you know the language well.  I say,
avoid them anyway, because your reader or hearer probably *doesn't*
kknow the language.  Along that line, it's condescending to use a
foreign word and then translate it."

My father was an engineer, one of the second generation of electrical
engineers after Edison's first thrust into the power business.  He
graduated from the University of Florida in 1925.   There were eight
engineering students in his class.  In the whole country 2400
"electrical students" graduated that year.  The next year he served an
apprenticeship at General Electric in Schenectedy which earned him a
E.E. in addition to his B.S.E.E..  His was one of 80-some graduate
degrees in engineering awarded in 1926.  With these credentials, he
started work as a junior engineer with Florida Power, reading
electrical meters and trouble-shooting customer complaints.  His
career as an engineer was spent building transmission lines and
substations.

Power companies started out by lighting city streets and running
trolleys, but by the 1930s they had begun building the North American
power grid.  Most people remember it only from the blackout in 1966,
but it worked all the other nights, and clocks keep the same time in
all of North America east of the Rockies.

Dad had dropped his Reserve commission a few years before Pearl
Harbor, but he was turned down by all three services before he was
made a first lieutenant in the Signal Corps because he was an
engineer.   He spent most of the war in technical documentation,
writing manuals about teletype systems at Fort Monmouth and filming
simulated war scenes in Bronx and Central Parks.  He spent one tour at
Walt Disney studios filming training shorts that combined animation -
the teletypewriter "net", for instance, and live action - the
operators, equipment, and so forth. Disney did several films combining
live action and animation right after the war.  I have a Mickey Mouse
book inscribed to me by Walt Disney.  He did not serve overseas, but
even as a technical writer and film director he had a carbine and pack
right there in the house with us, the implication being that he could
be called at any time.

Right after the war, he spent several years - it seems now - removing
generating equipment from navy generator ships and adding it to the
the generating capacity.  He later designed and built many substations
where the high voltage power from the inter-city transmission lines
comes into town.  The substations are nodes on the power grid.  Many
of these installations are now controlled by real-time systems.  As a
young engineer, my father had trained himself not to jump when he got
a shock because behind power switchboards you can jump from trouble
into bad trouble. (He always had aplomb though, even outside of
switchboards.  Once he shook grated cheese into his coffee in a
restaurant.  The waitress rushed over and tried to correct him.  He
smiled, "I know it's cheese.  I always have cheese with my coffee,"
and drank it down, cheese and all.)   I enjoyed hanging around the
power company.  The system operators had "digital" clocks because
they had to keep correct and exact time, even if the common man hadn't
developed the need yet.  I got to turn the street lights on, and even
better than that, the main substation was down near the railroad yards
and there were always steam locomotives working around.  [The South
was behind the times.  I am only 42.]

I started out in engineering at Purdue, but switched rapidly to
English and my father encouraged me.  "My second love turned out
to be your first love," he said, and he liked my being a writer, but
that doesn't mean he didn't get a great kick out of it when I ended up
in the engineering end of the computer business a few years ago.

One of the engineering magazines my father used to get was a freebie
sent out by the Copperweld Company, a major electrical-equipment
supplier.  This magazine was filled with droll observations, quotes
and comments from all over, and was one of the direct models for
Desperado, a graceful, intelligent publication aimed at engineers.  My
father thought engineers should be as well educated as anyone else,
and he took a great interest in all he found around him in the world.

I am sorry my father didn't see Desperado as often as you do.  I sent
him stuff off the net, but I never got organized enough to send the
great bulk of it to him.  I wish he'd been on the net.  He liked a
good stew.

The following is from an article in The Telegraph describing a error in The
Globe involving a erroneous report that the FBI and the Secret Service got
their wires crossed.

        "There were no FBI agents [at the Eire Pub]," said Peter Rush,
        special agent in charge of the Secret Service Boston office.
        "If there's one thing a fed can do is spot another fed.  We all
        wear the same kind of shoes."

We in the UK were privileged last night to receive *live from Pasadena*
the Superbowl Championship.  Since it started at 11.30 pm and went on
till 2.30 am, I didn't stay up to watch too much of it.  At the risk
of the wrath of your afficionadi (?) descending upon me, I deduced the
following rules for the game (as it appeared to me):

  1.  Each player still alive at the end of the match scores 10 points.

  2.  The main object is for a player to grab the ball, then fall down on
      the ground.  Everyone else then rushes to jump on the player with the
      ball.  Points are scored according to the height of the resulting
      mound.

  3.  The event described in (2) occurs at approximately 10 second intervals,
      and is then followed by 3 minutes of action replays, and 2 minutes
      of advertising (which we don't get to see).

  4.  The game is played with four teams, two male and two female.  While
      the male teams are killing each other on the pitch, the (pretty)
      female teams wave feather dusters about.  There seems to be some
      ritual involved, but I didn't work out the scoring system here.

  5.  Sometimes a player actually kicks the ball.  The penalty for this
      infringement is ususally a broken leg.

  6.  Players attempt to intimidate the opposing team by using black
      warpaint on their faces.

Or have I misunderstood something?
Jeff.

PS. It looks a lot more fun than cricket.

I just heard something like the following on local radio:

        How would you like to drive a Chevyota?  Sources
        inform us that Chevrolet and Toyota are that close
        to an agreement to produce a small car in this
        country.

Chevyota?  Well, I guess it's better that Toyolet.

Never fear big words
Big long words name little things
All big things have little names
Such as life and death, peace and war
Or dawn, day, night, hope, love, home.
Learn to use little words in a big way
It is hard to do
But they say what you mean.
When you don't know what you mean--
Use big words
They often fool little people.
