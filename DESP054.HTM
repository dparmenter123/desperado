                        A Final Word

        Technical writing  is a dynamic craft.   By now you know that you
        are the hub of  tumultuous activity.   With your support group of
        developers, editors,  writers, marketing  reps and other real and
        pseudo-savants, you manufacture an idea into a published reality.
        A cause for pride?  You bet.

        Before the  blessed event are the trials of labor, however.   And
        tech  writers are  no  more  immune to  them than  are  any other
        professionals.   Code that  won't freeze, even as your book heads
        through wintry air  to the printer; developers who won't give you
        the time of day (even in octal!); mastering concepts only to have
        them etched into  oblivion in the next base level;  so many cooks
        in the broth that...well, it's just a part of the job.

        You'll never be bored.

I am selling several pairs of tickets to a recital by Joseph Silverstein,
Concertmaster of the BSO.  All proceeds from this recital will go to
Amnesty International.

The recital will be held on Friday, April 1, at the First and Second Church
in Boston, on Marlboro Street.  This will apparently be one of Silverstein's
last performances before he leaves the BSO.

Tickets are $10 each.  If you fill out a Matching Gift form, DEC will
match your contribution.  If you want to buy the tickets, send me mail
on CLOSUS or call me at DTN 249-1835.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Desperados, Amnesty International is the enemy of political
oppression, regardless of the rhetoric that accompanies it,
right-wing, left-wing, middle-wing, or know-nothing.  AI's efforts
have freed hundreds, if not thousands, of political prisoners.  AI won
a Nobel Peace Prize that's worth about a million Nobel Peace Prizes
awarded to the likes of Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho.

Subject: Origin of name TRON

I've heard what I believe to be a more likely source for the name TRON.

TRON is a PDP-10 instruction (Test Right, Ones, and skip if Not all masked
bits equaled 0).  It's opcode happens to be 666, the number of the beast.
It is known that PDP-10s were used to generate much of the graphic sequences
in the movie.

There is also a duplication of a computer "readout" in the book that is taken
directly from a TOPS-10 completion message.  (There's a rumor that the author
asked some of the special effects people for some "computerese" to include in
portion of the book and that is what they gave him.)

Subject: Another immutable rule of grammar

If (and only if) one is a resident of Bahston, the following rule applies:

"To form the plural of any noun ending in '-um,' such as 'datum,' replace
the '-um' with -'er,' as in 'dater'."

This rule is a specific application of the principle of Conservation of Rs.
The textbook example of this principle is 'data buffer', which must always
be pronounced "dater buffa" - or so I'm told...

      Pete Townsend's new album entitled "Scoop" is worth
      buying.

      The album is a selected group of demo cuts for various
      Who albums and some unreleased material.

      I found the whole thing rather interesting but, the
      demo for "Behind Blue Eyes" was especially interesting
      to me.  This track just has Pete on acoustic guitar,
      doing very simple cord progressions and backing himself
      up with his own over-tracked vocals.  The interesting
      thing about it (besides the way it sounds) is the
      difference in feeling between the demo and the actual
      Who recording were Roger Daltrey changed the vocal
      and made the whole song much more expressive.  Needless
      to say giving Pete his Tele(caster) and a Marshall
      helps too!

Roger is no doubt the better singer, but have you noticed that with
every album, Pete sounds more and more like him?  And, speaking of
premier screamers, MTV subscribers keep an eye out for Robert Plant
singing old rock'n'roll classics like "Little Sister" with an all-star
band with Dave Edmunds on lead guitar.

Subject: FOUR BALL RALLY

The second annual Michael A. Preston Memorial Four Ball Rally will
be held sometime in the first two weeks of June.  This is an illegal
car race from Boston Ma, to San Diego Ca.  Last year it was won by
a 1982 Mercedes in a time of 37 hours, 18 minutes, with an average
speed of 80 mph.  First place paid $10,000.00.  For more information

Two really lousy movies - "Cannonball Run" and "Gumball Rally" -  have
been made about this race or its predecessors.  Both movies were
filmed almost entirely in Southern California which sort of fails to
give the feeling of crossing the country.

Subject: STRATUS comments

Thanks to both of you (I already thanked Rick) for the STRATUS notes.  The
'how many backup units are we shipping with MICRO' heading may be a bit
unfair to us:  with 8 $100 processors in their box, not to mention the
cost of all the other duplicated hardware, and ESPECIALLY not to mention
the cost of duplicating disks, I don't think STRATUS will EVER be competing
in the same market as MICRO, though with volume to soak up the software
costs they might eventually get systems down into the $40K - $50K range.
By definition, wholly-redundant ('non-stop') systems suffer a price/
performance disadvantage factor of at least 2 up to the point where the
costs of the terminals (assumed non-redundant) swamp the cost of the rest
of the (redundant) hardware - and terminal prices are still going down.

Fail-safe operation is a fascinating technical problem, and the STRATUS
approach seems pleasingly clean, but in the real world there seem to be
very few people willing to pay twice as much for their computer just to
gain the difference between reliability and infallibility (despite our
fears, Tandem didn't take over the world after all).  These few people
have system needs in the mid-range and up:  the V-11 seems to be the
lowest-cost processor we have in sight to which this type of system
would be applicable (and I hope someone is working on one).  Low-end
systems should still concentrate on price/performance, and provide as
much reliability (and easy recovery from failure) as they can without
driving up hardware cost.

From the "PDP-11 Architecture Handbook", 1983, Chapter 1, page 3:

        "Because the PDP-11 family has been around since 1970,
        its hardware and software are proven, time-tested, and
        thoroughly debugged."

Although music mode is not the escape sequence that makes your VT1xx terminal
smoke and lurch, it does seem to cause some damage, the first symptom of which
is to make you terminal a tone-deaf, monotonic baritone.

Desperado is an RSX production and therefore assumes that Mail knows
how to scroll.  Desperado reads much better if Mail scrolls.  Readers
on lesser systems should maybe make a file and read that rather than
hitting &lt;RET&gt; over and over.  Would it help if I scattered a lot of
&lt;FF&gt;s through it?
