Subj:   Security brou-ha-ha

        In case you haven't heard about this, the latest hoopla around
        here concerns a case in New Jersey (I won't say anything,
        Andrew). Apparently, some kid broke into a VMS system, prodded
        around, was caught and prosecuted.

        His defense was that since the system said, "Welcome to mumble,"
        that he was invited in and therefore free to do as he pleased.
        Well, the judge let him off. The security people, instead of
        acting calmly and deliberately (after all, what does this mean
        about welcome mats in front of people's houses, eh?), have
        sounded the trumpets, leaped on their horses, firm in their
        faith that the castle walls have been breached.

        The upshot is that they are advocating not saying what system
        you're logging into, saying tautological things in login
        messages like, "unauthorized access is prohibited." Furthermore,
        they're even trying to argue that that statement isn't
        tautological when told that it is and that they're being calm
        when told that they aren't. Don't they make people take a
        semantics course in college any more? In general, there's lots
        of hysteria in lots of notes conferences and otherwise sensible
        people are issuing silly edicts about what to say in the system
        login messages and how much barbed wire should be placed around
        every terminal in the company.

        Being a good corporate citizen, I revamped my system messages to
        meet the threat of unwittingly welcoming miscreants to my
        system. Here are my new system messages for ERIS, culled from a
        SET HOST 0/LOG:

 ERIS -- I just want you to know that you're not at all welcome here.

Username: CALLAS
Password:
                This is ERIS, a VAXstation in VMS development.

        In accordance with the new company security policy I should
        inform you that if you're not supposed to be here, then you're
        not supposed to be here. You know know this just as well as I,
        and there's no use pretending that you don't. This VAX is
        positively lousy with security alarms, so if you're not supposed
        to be here, you really had better log out now lest something
        dreadful happen that you get blamed for. The corporate lawyers
        are in a particularly surly mood these days and are apt to do
        something nasty like mercilessly prosecute you until you end up
        hanged, drawn, quartered, flayed into small morsels, made into
        sausages, cremated, and your ashes flung under the floorboards
        of a small New England church where Irish cloggers will disturb
        your rest on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays (not to mention the
        Saturday morning children's tap school) for a long, long, time.
        They're particularly unpleasant to repeat offenders. Don't say
        you weren't warned, because you were.

        On the other hand, if you are supposed to be here, welcome
        and happy computing.

Well, children, we are obviously living in the end of days. I'm working on
a more or less promotional piece for my beloved software product, and one
of the features of this product is that it can display a login message,
and you see it first thing when you sign on.  The example in the old version of
the piece had the login screen saying hospitably "Welcome to ACMS!".
The example in the new piece says, with the asperity that makes lawyers happy,
"Unauthorized access prohibited". Why not "Come on in and let me get you a
glass of buttermilk and a baba au rhum?"

Subj:   For Desperado:  How to eat ice cream and cake

[From Boston Globe, 2 June 1987]

Dear Miss Manners:

   What is the proper way to serve ice cream and cake?

Gentle Reader:

   This is one of the few matters of table etiquette in which the key
factor is the age of the guests.
   People of all ages know that ice cream and cake is best eaten by
mashing the ice cream down into the cake with the back end of a spoon,
preferably while chanting to oneself.  But only people under the age
of 5 can get away with it, and then only when Miss Manners isn't looking.
   In order to allow adults to simulate this enjoyment, which is to
say to eat ice-cream-and-cake rather than two separate desserts, the
items are put on a plate together, with the ice cream on top of the
cake or off to one side.
   The adults are issued both dessert spoons and forks.  They may
alternate using these, eating the ice cream with the spoon and the
cake with the fork, or may keep the fork in the left hand and use it
to push ice cream soaked cake into the spoon, which is held in the
right hand.  They are not allowed to hum.

Subj:   AD to Cat &amp; Duck IFR method

    1. Using Ducks for IFR has limitations:

       - Ducks often migrate. So in the fall, you could get re-routed
         to distant southern airports, and in the spring, you could
         get re-routed to distant northern airports. So it is important
         to pick a non-migrating duck, e.g., the white duck-feeding-pond
         duck usually does not migrate.

       - Clever ducks often use his "unsuspecting" IFR pilots as flak cover
         during hunting season. This is embarassing to both the hunter
         (how does he stuff a Cessna) and the pilot (how does he explain
         being out-smarted by a duck).

        - Never use an unbanded duck for IFR. If you have an accident, the
          FAA will ask to see the following:
                1. your pilot license
                2. the aircraft airworthinees certificate and maintenance log
                3. your duck band.

    2.  Another way to keep a cat awake and on its feet is to have a
        goldfish bowl mounted on the dash (of course, the water-level
        and goldfish itself acts as a backup turn and bank indicator).

    3.  If solo, take measures to prevent your cat from sleeping behind
        the rudder pedals in the right seat. Cats love to crawl there
        and sleep due to the warmth of the engine firewall. Don't lose
        rudder control due to a sleeping cat!

          "Computer software might be particularly opaque to  operators  of
     complex  systems.   For  example, consider the hypothetical problem of
     distinguishing whether an SLBM (Submarine Launched Ballistic  Missile)
     that  has struck, say, Japan was launched from a Soviet submarine or a
     Chinese submarine.  If the programmers of the computer that  processes
     infrared sensor data from the U.S.  satellite early warning system had
     considered this scenario too unlikely to waste time on,  the  software
     might  not  compare  the  launch  point, trajectory, and booster plume
     characteristics of the missile to an intelligence data base  and  make
     an  identification.   On  the other hand, the system's designers might
     have considered identification quite  important  and  have  discovered
     further  that  separating Soviet from Chinese missiles by their plumes
     was easy.   A  third  possibility  is  that  the  priority  placed  on
     distinguishing  Soviet  from Chinese missiles was high enough to get a
     subroutine included in the software but not  high  enough  to  get  it
     written  or  checked  carefully.   The  subroutine  was  written by an
     employee of the contractor who has since  moved  to  another  software
     company.   In  researching  the  intelligence  on missile plumes, this
     employee  had  found  that  Soviet  and  Chinese  missiles  could   be
     distinguished  fairly  easily  by  infrared  sensing  if  they flew on
     northerly trajectories and were viewed from geosynchronous  equatorial
     orbit,  but  not if they flew on easterly trajectories.  Nevertheless,
     the employee made the best of a bad situation and wrote a program that
     made  the  best determination possible for non-northerly trajectories.
     Years later the mysterious eastward launch occurs.  After a period  of
     processing,  the  sensor  software identifies the furor that ensues to
     wonder how the sensor knew what nation was responsible.  A quick  call
     to  the  contractor  fails  to  turn  up  the  employee  who wrote the
     subroutine, but the operator receives the contractor's assurance  that
     the   program   used   the   best   available   intelligence  to  make
     identifications.  The operator, now satisfied, allows a message to  be
     prepared for the president identifying the missile as Soviet.

          This hypothetical example suggests that within  complex  software
     inferences  might  be  made and presented to decisionmakers as certain
     that are actually based on outdated  information,  poor  analysis,  or
     error  committed  long  before.  Something similar happened aboard the
     British  warship  Sheffield  during  the   Falklands   conflict   with
     Argentina.   The  Sheffield's defensive sensors detected in flight the
     Exocet missile that destroyed the ship but classified it as 'friendly'
     because it had been built by the French."

        It was almost a public-relation man's dream come true.  CBS was
        on the phone asking if the chairman of Lotus Development Co.,
        a software company based in Cambridge, Mass., would come to New
        York to be interviewed about the company's new products.  Greg
        Jarboe, the public-relations director, readily agreed.  After all,
        what company would turn down a chance to plug its product
        coast-to-coast?

        Then he went to see the chairman, Jim P. Manzi.  Mr. Manzi, as usual,
        was wearing a white shirt.  Mr. Jarboe told him to wear a blue one
        because it looks better on television.  Mr Manzi said he didn't like
        blue shirts and didn't own any.  Mr Jarboe persevered. Mr Manzi
        bought a blue shirt.

        "All the way down to New York, he was complaining about how he didn't
        like the shirt and how it didn't fit right", Mr Jarboe says.

        When they arrived at CBS studios on West 52nd, they were greeted
        politely and shown into a studio-for CBS radio.

    In July, my wife and I shall be taking a vacation in the Northwest of
    the USA. The trip came about as a result of a competition prize of 2
    transatlantic airline tickets (we live in Reading, England).

    The only things which are fixed are the flights - arrive Seattle
    29-July, return from Seattle 3 weeks later. We have never visited that
    part of the USA before - and in fact it's my wife's first US visit.
    Looking at the maps and guide books, there is a huge range of places to
    go, things to see. Our outline plan is to tour by road, maybe taking in
    Glacier, Yellowstone and Crater Lake National Parks.

    Now then, Desperadoes, I'm **sure** there are lots of you with some
    great advice on where to go, what to see, what to do, and maybe even
    what to avoid. Please share it with us, and make it a great vacation!

The one thing I know that you should do in Seattle at least is plan to do
some shopping for clothes (anybody remember the Coasters' song? But do you
really *need* a mohair double-breasted pin-striped suit?). Northwest chic
runs largely to great-looking outdoorsy gear, which I myself have never
had a need for, but you may be a rugged type. The things you pick up reading
your husband's Business Week at breakfast! And if you're a Wagner fan, they
do the preeminent American Ring in Seattle. There are restaurants that
turn around and around and give you a great view of the city, but it's
gotten so they have those in Rabbit Hash, Kentucky. Have a great time!

                   Garden Gnome goes Europe or Bust

Associated Press

Hutton, England

For nine months, the mystery of Bobby the missing garden gnome had
baffled the people of this western England village.

In September, Pam and Gordon Barwick discovered the 10 inch carved-stone
gnome missing. In its place was a note saying:" Gone off for a few months
on my holidays. Don't worry, I'll be back."

Then the postcards began to turn up - "wish-you-were-here" messages all
signed "Bobby" from Norway, Denmark and Sweden, then Germany, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Spain, France, Austria, Italy, and Yugoslavia, and finally the Greek
island of Corfu.

"We were absolutely baffled," said Pam Barwick, 55.

Then one morning last week, Bobby was back in the Barwick's garden, wearing
sunglasses and clutching a miniature travel bag with toothbrush, toothpaste
and holiday photos. One showed him in a Norwegian bar with a blond woman.

A note beside the gnome said: "Had a lovely time. It's nice to be back with
the family. I will try not to disappear again."

The local paper, the Mercury did some digging and on Friday exposed the
culprets: Michael Sanders, 22 and Steve Kerslake, 24 who cheerfully admitted
taking Bobby with them on their camper tour of Eurpoe.

"Bobby's back intact and we've had a good laugh." Barwick told the Associated
Press.

"The Last Days of Lake Wobegon"  by Brian Deming

It was a noisy week in Lake Wobegon.  All of the excitement was over the end
of "A Prairie Home Companion."  After 13 years, Garrison Keillor is bringing
to a close the popular show on National Public Radio, causing agitation that
could be felt throughout Mist County, Minnesota.

Members of the Lake Wobegon Chamber of Commerce met in emergency session in
the brand new Lake Wobegon Cultural Center, on the sight of the old Sidetrack
Tap.

"We're not going to let this destroy our community," said Ralph, president of
the chamber and owner of Ralph's Pretty Good Shopping Mall.  "We can't get
along without Keillor.  We'll just have to think of how.  Maybe a theme park."

The discussion of Keillor's departure overshadowed all other business of the
meeting - the proposed four-lane underpass to relieve some of the traffic
congestion downtown, the raising of the rates in the five-story parking ramp
next to the Chez Chatterbox (Reservations Only), even the question of water
service to the Lake Wobegon Estates subdivision on Adam's Hill.

The sense of despair was palpable throughout the metropolitan area.  No wonder.
Thirteen years ago no one had heard of Lake Wobegon.  The state refused to
put it on the map.  No one visited except by accident.

Then Keillor started telling stories about the little town, and the boom began.

First there were the brash big-city types from St. Cloud.  They'd stop and
gawk at the Statue of the Unknown Norwegian and ask for directions to the
house of the famous Wally "Old Hard Hands" Bunsen.

Then came whole families from as far away as Fargo, North Dakota.  They'd come
and spend the weekend at Art's Bait &amp; Night O'Rest Motel so they could
experience good old-fashioned unfriendliness.  They'd walk around town trying
to catch a glimpse of a Norwegian bachelor farmer blowing his nose with his
index finger.

It wasn't long, naturally, before people with strange East Coast and West Coast
accents were seen lurking in real estate offices.  They were tired of the fast-
paced, materialistic, pretentious style of life.  They wanted to live in a
place where life was simpler; where the kids didn't have to be high achievers,
only above average; where you didn't feel in such competition to climb the
social ladder; where you didn't have to keep up with every single fad.

Besides. Lake Wobegon had become a trendy place to live.

So, Lake Wobegon grew.  Byron Tollefson started Lake Wobegon industries to
produce Whippet baseball souvenirs, little plastic models of the Co-op Elevator
and T-shirts that say "Sumus quod summus" and "Tellwitcha."  Bunsen Motors
expaned, and its name was changed to Bunsen BMW.  The Norwegian bachelor
farmers sold out and started a chain of health clubs.

The new population brought change.  Adult education classes had to be added to
accommodate the new demand for Norwegian language lessons.  Special paths had
to be provided to serve joggers.  Toast 'n Jelly Days became the Bagels and
Brie Festival.  Sons of Knute cancelled their annual hunting trips to devote
more time to their Save the Whales campaigns.

But now the future of the Lake Wobegon Metropolitan Area, including East Lake
Wobegon, Lake Wobegon Hills, Wobegon-by-the-Lake and New Albion Farms, may be
threatened with the end of "A Prairie Home Companion."  Without the show,
tourism will fall, growth will stop and Lake Wobegon may disappear from maps
once again.

Members of the Chamber of Commerce flirted with ideas to save the town.  Clint
Bunsen suggested a TV miniseries.  Carl Lundberg thought the town could recruit
a new humorist.  "There should be someone besides Keillor who can tell stories
just as good," he said, "who can make a little Minnesota town seem so funny
and fascinating."

No, the other members agreed, there isn't.

Subj:   Douglas Adams strikes again
        .

        . (more arpagarbage [thanks, Tom, that's a wonderful word])
        .

From the ``Feedback'' column of the 11 June 1987 `New Scientist.'

Douglas Adams, creator of the `Hitchhikers's Guide to the Galaxy,' has
just published his fifth novel, `Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective
Agency.'  Adams describes the book as a ghostly detective story,
although most of it is a satirical look at the computer industry.
Adams's love affair with computers even led him to do his own
typesetting at home, using a ``desktop publishing'' system.  He claims
that the reason was that he was late in delivering the manuscript.

One of Adams's computer projects will not see the light of day.  It is
a game he dreamt up a couple of years ago with an American company, to
be called `An Evening with Ronald Reagan.'

``We realised that the limits of a computer game were the same as
those of the President.  Whoever briefs Reagan has the problem of
creating the illusion of intelligence.  Reagan is very much a `2K'
man.  You have to provide him with the absolute minimum of facts and
the maximum way in which responses can be triggered.

``If we created a database full of little phrases he has used, we
would be able to produce quite a good simulation of conversation with
Ronald Reagan.

Like most computer simulations, the system would occasionally break
down and produce absurd results.  But the effect, says Adams, ``would
be exactly the same as when the President does it''.

For a launch party, Adams proposed carrying out a Turing test with the
White House press corps.  The idea, first proposed by the pioneer
mathematician Alan Turing, is that the test for machine intelligence
should be that a person questioning it should not be aware that it is
a machine.

Adams had the idea of assembling the entire White House press corps in
front of two terminals, and asking the journalists which, if either,
was the computer and which was the President of the United States.

However, the company ``became very jumpy'' when Reagan went into
hospital, and decided that the game might be in bad taste.  Could the
idea be revived with our own Prime Minister.  Probably not, says
Adams.  ``Whatever your feelings about Maggie, you cannot deny she is
intelligent.  The beauty of Reagan is that his limitations are so
utterly those of a computer game.''

The June 11th issue of the Computing magazine here in the UK had an interesting
bit on the last page...

"At Index - the recent European exhibition for Digital Equipment users -
vistors were warned of language hurdles in the European market.

A price list for DEC Germany was translated into English revealing the most
odd range of products.  Have you ever heard of a VAX Reminder?  Or a VAX
Liquid Full Stop?  Or a Two Times Boozer and Guard?

With a bit of technical retranslation the "Reminder" becomes "VAX memory",
the "Liquid Full Stop" a "VAX Floating Point", and the one that sounds like
a programmer who's been in the buisness a bit too long becomes a "Dual Floppy
Disk"

[Publisher's Note:  This story is most likely incorrectly maligning DEC Germany;
 I have a copy of the price list of a British firm specializing in used DEC gear
 which has these very errors in their German edition.  --john]

Heard on "Good Morning America" -

A news journalist traveled to Venice for the recent Economic Summit.
Upon arriving there, he sent the following cablegram back to his
office in the US which read:

        "Arrived Venice.  Streets flooded.  Please advise."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Setting aside the fact that Robert Benchley said it better in a telegram to
Dorothy Parker in 1934 ("Streets full of water, please advise"), it's still
a good line. I am still astonished at how few good jokes came out of that
conference, aside from international monetary policy.

Subj:   Bubba's Commentary on GQ's list of things to do before 30

GQ'S PENSIVE POUTS HAVE NOTHING OVER ON BUBBA'S OVERALLS
        by Dennis Rogers

  Guys, let's talk hip.

  Serious male hipness. Hip, like in Gentleman's Quarterly. Of course if
you're a really hip kind of guy, you call it GQ.

  This is a magazine that features male models wearing greasy hair combed
straight back so the comb marks show, sports coats with the sleeves pushed up,
and pensive looks. I'd look pensive, too, if I'd just dropped $350 on a shirt
that needs ironing.

  In its most recent issue, which I swear on the grave of Hank Williams is the
first one I ever bought, there is an article titled "99 things every
30-year-old must know".

  It says, for instance, that by the time you are 30, you guys should: have
bailed a buddy out of jail, have been to a half a dozen major league ball
parks, have had your heart broken, have had a one night stand you're ashamed
of, be able to politely say no to a woman, have thrown out your Aqua Velva,
have given up air guitar, have said something to a boss and lover that you'll
regret for the rest of your life, have all your posters in frames, own socks
in colors other than blue, brown and black, and have spent one night in either
jail, a bordello, a monastery, a youth hostel or a Motel 6.

  It is stuff like that that makes you hip, GQ says.

  But this is not hip. This is pretending to be hip. Real Hip is Country Hip.
Real Hip is knowing that Hank Williams Jr.'s mama's name was Miss Audrey and
being able to sink a two-rail pool shot the long way. Real Hip is Bubba Hip.

  It takes a different set of skills and experiences to be Bubba Hip. While GQ
insists that to be hip you must own a tuxedo, Bubba says you must own at least
one pair of bibbed overalls that you wear without a shirt.

  GQ says you should own a power drill by age 30. Bubba says make that a chain
saw and not one of those dinky suburban ones either, but a full throttle
monster that can cut through a Plymouth.
  GQ says 30-year-olds should have had six nights that you could not remember
the day after. Bubba says you should wake up at least six mornings and not
remember where you left your pickup or the name of the street where you are.

  GQ says you should know how to pronounce "Chassagne-Montrachet and when to
drink it". Bubba says you should know how to pronuounce "chitterlings" and
have the guts not to eat them when those around you are making fools of them-
selves.

  GQ says you should know which is worth more, a flush or a straight, and why.
Bubba says if you don't know, you are welcome to play poker with him any time.

  GQ says you should be able to carve a turkey by the time you are 30. Bubba
says that you should never carve a turkey that you didn't shoot, either in the
woods or at the rescue squad's annual fund-raising turkey shoot.

  GQ says you should "have used a good one-liner if perchance, God forbid, by
some quirk of fate occasionally you were unable to perform sexually". Bubba
has no idea what they're talking about.

  GQ says you should have had "an adult sports experience that equals in glory
a childhood sports experience". Bubba adds that it should involve shotguns,
pool cues or a bored and stroked '66 GTO.

  GQ says you must have one restaurant where you are known and still welcome.
Bubba says you must have one tavern where you are known -- and not welcome.

  GQ says you should be able to pick a ripe cantaloupe. Bubba says you should
be able to grow a ripe cantaloupe.

  GQ says you should, by the time you are 30, have skinny dipped with someone
worth bragging about. Bubba says you should never swim nekkid with a lady then
brag about it.

  GQ says you should be able to speak a foreign language by the time you
are 30. Bubba says that speaking English is tough enough for him by 11:30 on
Saturday night.

  GQ says you should be able to hum the entire score of "Guys and Dolls".
Bubba says you should be able to complete the following country music lyric:
"I was drunk the day my mama got out of prison...".

  GQ says you should have worn an earring by the time you're 30. Bubba says he
thinks he understands the problem with GQ hip.

hot line for the public to report complaints about aviation safety,
airport noise, and other general problems.

Subj:   Ramp update

Readers of the Ramp Tour itinerary might be interested in this succinct
description of ramps, which appeared in the June 3 Boston Globe food
section as the very last item in an article about newly available,
rediscovered, obscure and designer greens.  Nutritional information may
be unavailable, but I can testify that I've taken the ramp cure many
times and it's always worked for me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wild Leek (also Ramp) -- Scallion-slim stalk streaked with violet and
graceful leaves resembling those of lily of the valley has a wild and
woodsy aroma and ferocious onion-garlic flavor. Available from March to
June.  Cook wild leeks in just about any way that you would cultivated
ones, but with discretion, as they are stronger.  Commonly consumed raw
in ramp country, but may be too pungent for all but the most devoted.
No nutritional information available.

We've all seen them, we've all read them, some of us have even bought
them: those marvelous tabloids in the checkout line with the improbable
(not to say howlingly funny) headlines like (this one was really
printed) CANNIBALS SHRINK SPACE ALIEN'S HEAD or (this wasn't) DWARF
RAPES NUN, FLEES IN UFO.  And I imagine I'm not the only person who
wondered whether those headlines were really generated by computer...
and I might not be the only person who sat down and thought up a simple
hack to *do* just that... but thanks to the Power of Symbolic Computing
(tm), I did it.  (Took about ten minutes, too.  Lisp is cool.)

Here are a few of the better ones. It's not working perfectly yet, but
it's pretty realistic.  Code on request.  (Just the thing to add to your
