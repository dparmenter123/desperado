Subj:   Flags

I bet you enjoyed the article in the Boston Globe Sunday magazine yesterday
(except it was too short) where they asked a bunch of prominent personalities
how they would redesign the American flag.  If you missed it, find a copy.

I had some trouble walking the dog the morning of June 14 this year, since
some pseudo- (or perhaps really) patriotic real estate company had lined the
route with little plastic flags just about the right height (one foot) for
the dog to pee on.  I managed to keep him from doing it; I would have felt
like a real jerk.  I guess it was you who helped me see that progressive
politics is more than compatible with respect for the flag.  Too bad I didn't
get this little story in in time for Desperado 3047.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        It's everybody's flag.

        I'll post this now and read the Globe later.  Also noted in
        passing:  The Globe had an article about one of these yuppie flag
        makers, you know, flags with cocktail glasses for a party, wreaths
        for Christmas, irises for spring, etc.  The article appeared on
        Flag Day, did not mention the Star Spangled Banner in any way, and
        was the only article in the paper that day on flags of any kind.

                HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING

 To help you make a good decision about whether to sign up for Real Estate,
City College wants you to know that, according to the latest informaiton,
132%, or 632 of 447 students in this program scheduled to graduate in
1988-89 went on to graduate.

(The number of studens scheduled to graduate in 1988-89 was defined as 80%
of the number of students enrolled in 1987-88.  Graduates were defined as
the number of students listed as Completers on the 1988-89 NCES 2404-A
Postsecondary Enrollment and Completion Report.  Because "scheduled to
graduate" is a derived number, percentage who graduate may exceed 100%.)

No information is available on the number of students scheduled to graduate
in 1989 who found jobs in Real Estate.

        The Washington Monthly had an excellent piece last month pointing
        out that the number one quota system in American universities, does
        not benefit the deserving poor or deserving minorities, but the
        undeseserving offspring of past graduates, "legacies", so called.
        Among those quoted, the right-wingers of the Dartmouth Review, so
        proud of their racism and their unfair treatment by the Dartmouth
        administration, favorites of the Wall Street Journal editorial
        page, who spent pages denouncing quota systems of all kinds as
        demeaning to and actually harmful to the interests of minorities
        (as if they cared), but winding up with a cowardly endorsement of
        quotas for the children of graduates.

        If I ever run for President, which I won't because it is so
        demeaning, my platform will come in large part from the Washington
        Monthly.

Subj:   School war story, sort of, for Desperado

What are they teaching our young people these days?  I dunno, but
here's what it looked like to me today.

I'm tutoring a grad student who is taking a night course in data
structures.  The past couple of weeks have been spent on stacks.  So
after class last week he came in and drew a linked-list stack for me
the way the instructor had shown it to the class:

    Base                                Current
     +------+------+   +------+------+   +------+------+
     | data | link |--&gt;| data | link |--&gt;| data | link |--&gt;NIL
     +------+------+   +------+------+   +------+------+

This didn't make a lot of sense to me because I didn't see any
reasonable way to get back to the previous node when you pop the
current element off the stack.  So I said the instructor must just have
got the links backward; it should look like this:

    Base                                Current
     +------+------+   +------+------+   +------+------+
     | data | link |   | data | link |   | data | link |
     +------+------+   +------+------+   +------+------+
         A     |           A     |                 |
         |     |           |     |                 |
         +-----------------------+                 |
               |           +-----------------------+
               v
              NIL

This is simplicity itself; to pop a node, all you have to do is read
its link, dispose of the node, and set Current to the value you read
from the link.

This confused my student no end; why would the instructor draw all the
links backward in two successive classes?  I said I didn't know, maybe
the instructor was just being careless.  But we had a long and
marginally acrimonious discussion; it took a lot of convincing to get
the student to believe that my way was right.  I finally did it,
though.

So this week my student developed a program based on my version.  Then,
after it was all done and tested, we talked some more about the
instructor's version.  Turns out that it does work.  But omigawd is it
ever absurd!  In order to pop a node, you have to go back to the base
of the stack and traverse the whole bloomin' linked list until you find
the node whose link points at NIL, remembering the previous node at
each step.  Then, when you find the NIL link, you can set the previous
link to NIL and dispose of the current node...

And this is the way most of the students in this class will learn to
use linked lists - I'm not looking forward with great expectations of
efficiency to the next generation of software!

     Purposeful autonomous behavior requires having reliable
locative  information in order to help assess the desirabil-
ity of pursuing particular actions to  sense,  perceive,  or
alter one's position in the environment.  Having the ability
to ascertain location based  on  imperfect  perceptual  cues
that  are  extracted  from real-world contexts is a critical
requirement  for  truly  autonomous  closed-loop   behavior.
While  some  of the well known non-perceptual locative tech-
niques such as dead reckoning, registration of  inertial  or
geo-stationary-satellite location data with an environmental
map, and maintaining a global  cartesian-map  representation
throughout  movement  activities remain topics of investiga-
tions, they require near perfect measurements  of  direction
and  traversed distances, significant computation resources,
and are limited by the range of  their  sensors.  To  extend
current  autonomous navigation capabilities that are limited
by these requirements, increasing attention has  focused  on
developing robust perceptual-based inference techniques that
derive location hypotheses  through  the  interpretation  of
perceptual  cues  within  the  context  of environmental map
descriptions.

     Some recent work on perceptual-based navigation schemes
has  emphasized  the integration of distinct sensor modality
data within the context of an environmental model to  assess
location. In this talk, we discuss an approach to autonomous
perceptual-based navigation that uniquely  exploits  eviden-
tial  reasoning (ER) techniques which embody interval proba-
bilistic methods that are based  on  work  of  Dempster  and
Shafer.  We will describe how such ER techniques can be used
to fuse and interpret multisensor data within the context of
a sparse spatial map of an office environment to infer loca-
tion, and show the results of preliminary  experiments  with
an autonomous mobile platform.

asked him when he last had sex.  His reply was, "1956."  She expressed
surprise at this, knowing that pilots tend to get around, so to speak.
"1956?" she said.  "Yes," said the pilot, "but it's only 2216 now."

            The following is a letter by Wess Rodgers, from Albuequerque,
            to the City of Boston, when he paid a parking ticket he
            received while visiting the Peoples Republic of Massachusetts.

                                                            Wess Rodgers
                                                            (address removed)
                                                            Sept. 12, 1990

    The City of Boston
    P.O. Box 2288
    Boston, Ma., 02107-2288

        I recently spent four days in Boston on a business trip.  In
    that time, I observed the following behaviors on your streets:

    1.  Five-ton trucks running at 55 mph on residential streets.
    2.  Dozens of drivers, including police, totally ignoring red
        lights, even making left turns against oncoming traffic
        against red lights.
    3.  Almost universal disregard for stop signs.
    4.  Almost universal disregard for speed limits.
    5.  Almost universal disregard for center lines.
    6.  A vehicle driving at double the speed limit on the wrong side
        of the street, with a police car passing it at the time.
        (The policeman was in the curb lane on the wrong side of the
        street.  I had to hit the curb and lock my brakes to avoid a
        head-on collision.  The policeman was displaying no emergency
        signals and completely ignored the driver of the other car.)
    7.  Vehicles making U-turns on the expressway (I-93) and
        proceeding to drive on the wrong side of the road.
    8.  Absolute, total disregard for any known norms of yielding
        right of way or sharing the road with other drivers.
    9.  City vehicles double or triple parking on downtown streets in
        heavy traffic, the drivers making obscene finger gestures to
        complaining motorists.
    10. Police ignoring the most flagrant violations of traffic laws
        and signals I have ever seen.
    11. Drivers following each other at less than four feet at speeds
        in excess of 70 mph on city streets.

        Then, on my last day in Boston I asked a policeman if I could
    legally park at the curb in the Quincy Market area.  He said,
    "Shuah.  Pahk anywheah yah like."  When I returned to my car an
    hour later I found a citation for parking in a loading zone.
        Can you imagine the irony of this?  You people drive like
    bloody cannibals.  You have no more respect for Human life or
    well-being than sewer rats who eat their own young.  Then, if
    a visitor has managed to survive your traffic and your brutality,
    you lie to them and fine them for believing you.
        Boston is, without a doubt, the most horrid, vicious, utterly
    despicable city on the face of this earth.  Here is my fine.  I
    wish you might choke on it.

    Contemptuously,
    Wess Rodgers

Cc: ellen%scrc-pegasus@uunet.UU.NET

This one came back to me...

Here's another Paul Ringe Passover Joke.  It's old, and I've seen it in
Reader's Digest, so you may have seen it, but I heard it first from him.
[He didn't "originate" it, but since he is in "The Biz", he gets them
early, and we get them at Passover.]  This is at least several years old:

A 75 year old man went to the doctor for a physical.  A couple of days
later he went back to get the results of all the tests, etc.  The doctor
waved his chart in the air and said, enthusiastically, "This is
incredible!  You are 55 years old, and you have the body of an athletic
35 year old!"

The man looked surprised, and said, "Did I say I was 55?!?"

The doctor checked the charts and said, "Oh, my gosh!  No, you're 75...
this is incredible, will you permit me to ask you some questions so that
I can write your case up for the "New England Journal of Medicine"?"

The man consented, so the doctor asked him, "How old was your father
when he died?"

The man answered, "Did I tell you that my father had died?"

The doctor replied, "No, but... you mean your father is STILL alive?!"

The man answered, "Sure.  He's 95 years old, lives in Boca Raton,
Florida, and he plays a round of golf every day, jogs six miles, plays a
few sets of tennis, and swims 100 laps.  He's going strong.

The doctor said, "That's astonishing!  How old was your grandfather when
he died?"

The man answered, "Did I tell you that my grandfather had died?"

The doctor said, "You mean your grandfather is STILL alive?!"

The man answered, "Sure.  He's 115, and he lives next to my father in
Boca Raton.  I admit he's slowing down... he's given up tennis, but he
still plays a round of golf with my father each day, and jogs about 3
miles, and swims at least 50 laps.  But he's doing fine... he's getting
married in a couple of weeks.

The doctor was completely at a loss.  He asked, "Why would a 115 year old
man want to get married?!"

The man answered, "Did I say he WANTED to get married?"

VNS TECHNOLOGY WATCH:                           [Mike Taylor, VNS Correspondent]
=====================                           [Littleton, MA, USA            ]

COMPUTERWORLD 1 April

                     CREATORS ADMIT UNIX, C HOAX

    In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken Thompson,
    Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix operating
    system and C programming language created by them is an elaborate April
    Fools prank kept alive for over 20 years.  Speaking at the recent
    UnixWorld Software Development Forum, Thompson revealed the following:

    "In 1969, AT&amp;T had just terminated their work with the GE/Honeywell/AT&amp;T
    Multics project. Brian and I had just started working with an early
    release of Pascal from Professor Nichlaus Wirth's ETH labs in
    Switzerland and we were impressed with its elegant simplicity and
    power. Dennis had just finished reading 'Bored of the Rings', a
    hilarious National Lampoon parody of the great Tolkien 'Lord of the
    Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided to do parodies of the Multics
    environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were responsible for the operating
    environment. We looked at Multics and designed the new system to be as
    complex and cryptic as possible to maximize casual users' frustration
    levels, calling it Unix as a parody of Multics, as well as other more
    risque allusions. Then Dennis and Brian worked on a truly warped
    version of Pascal, called 'A'. When we found others were actually
    trying to create real programs with A, we quickly added additional
    cryptic features and evolved into B, BCPL and finally C. We stopped
    when we got a clean compile on the following syntax:

    for(;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=C;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("| "+(*u/4)%2);

    To think that modern programmers would try to use a language that
    allowed such a statement was beyond our comprehension!  We actually
    thought of selling this to the Soviets to set their computer science
    progress back 20 or more years. Imagine our surprise when AT&amp;T and
    other US corporations actually began trying to use Unix and C!  It has
    taken them 20 years to develop enough expertise to generate even
    marginally useful applications using this 1960's technological parody,
    but we are impressed with the tenacity (if not common sense) of the
    general Unix and C programmer.  In any event, Brian, Dennis and I have
    been working exclusively in Pascal on the Apple Macintosh for the past
    few years and feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly
    bad programming that have resulted from our silly prank so long ago."

    Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&amp;T, Microsoft,
    Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time.
    Borland International, a leading vendor of Pascal and C tools,
    including the popular Turbo Pascal, Turbo C and Turbo C++, stated they
    had suspected this for a number of years and would continue to enhance
    their Pascal products and halt further efforts to develop C.  An IBM
    spokesman broke into uncontrolled laughter and had to postpone a
    hastily convened news conference concerning the fate of the RS-6000,
    merely stating 'VM will be available Real Soon Now'.  In a cryptic
    statement, Professor Wirth of the ETH institute and father of the
    Pascal, Modula 2 and Oberon structured languages, merely stated that P.
    T. Barnum was correct.

    In a related late-breaking story, usually reliable sources are stating
    that a similar confession may be forthcoming from William Gates
    concerning the MS-DOS and Windows operating environments.  And IBM
    spokesman have begun denying that the Virtual Machine (VM) product is
    an internal prank gone awry.

Tom,

I have thought of your comments regarding the Rn'R HoF and wondered if you
have  given any consideration about who should be in that isn't.  I have
mused over  who might/should be in the baseball HoF for years.  It seemed
like something was  wrong with the Supremes and Bobby Darin being in before
Eric Clapton and Led  Zeplin.  I guess it says more about who is doing the
voting.  While I might say  OK to Bill Haley, I stretch to include Ricky
Nelson.  Will Jimi Hendrix ever be  tapped?  Who do you think belongs in
the Cleveland memorial?

        Another J*m, jym dyer, wrote saying that the best form for the name
        of this kind of music was rock&amp;roll, which I am henceforth adopting
        as an official part of my prose style.

        Who do I think should be in the Rock&amp;Roll Hall of Fame.  Well, as I
        said, not Bobby Darin.  I mentioned a few others  I thought
        belonged there, but if they're really famous, then they don't need
        a "hall" and if they aren't famous, then being in a "hall" won't
        make them so.  It occurred to me that there ought to be more
        individual members.  Paul McCartney and Keith Richards, for
        example, can stand on their own.  Then I thought there were too few
        instrumentalists and promoters (and no record producers), the
        infrastructure was missing, but then we really don't want to see
        the world's best under assistant west coast promo man in the "hall"
        either, do we?

        So I finally settled on one missing person.

        Domenico Samudio, perhaps better known as Sam the Sham of Sam the
        Sham and the Pharoahs.  Author-instrumentalist-singer on the
        greatest single ever recorded in the total history of mankind
        from time immemorial to the psychotronic future, let's all count
        together now:  "Uno.  Dos.  One.  Two.  Tres.  Quatro."  This Sham
        is the real thing.

        Otherwise, you can just forget about the "hall".

        And, furthermore, and in addition to that, it is plain stupid to
        have the "hall" building designed by music-industry nobody I.M.
        Pei, the man who ruined the Louvre.  The last thing rock&amp;roll needs
        is intercontinental post-modern good taste.  I don't know what will
        go into the hall, but if it doesn't have some kind of waterfront
        dance hall with lots of neon and hamburgers at the back (a genre
        I.M. Pei hasn't done much with) it won't be worth plugging in and
        blowing the fuses in the joint.

        To be completely true to the rock&amp;roll tradition, the Hall of Fame
        should be run by a crook.

Cher Mantre --

Oh, Tom, did you set me off. I was at the park and in the bleachers the
night  the bleacher beasts started levitating that party doll, and talk
about your  virtual reality! We were sitting behind a troop of cub scouts,
and they were  piping, "Over here! Over here!" showing early symptoms of
testosterone  poisoning.

I was sitting on the best screened in porch in Brookline, New Hampsha, and
talking about this ugly experience when neighbor Jon told me about the
origin of  the practice.

The celebrants at Foxboro started doing this right after the Lisa Olsen
incident, in which, if you will recall, a fine sports reporter for the
Herald  was sexually harassed by several neanderthals who participate in
whatever sport  the Patriots think they're playing. It was understood that
it was Ms Olsen who  was thus represented.

Tom, did you see the article in Sports Illustrated about what kind of life
Olsen  has to lead these days? Distinctive in appearance, she cannot leave
her  apartment except between the hours of 5 a.m. and 5:15. Her car is
routinely  trashed, her apartment building covered with obscene graffiti.
She doesn't  answer her phone at home or at work. And I hope she has
somebody else open her  mail.

This woman has become a prisoner because she was just doing her job. The SI
article reported that she plans to leave the country because she can't get
a job  doing what she loves and does well anywhere in the U.S. Jon says
she's resettled in Australia.

I see the ads on  TV for those sisters who invade the locker room to make
Emily  Littella repartee about some restaurant with an athlete, and I think
what a  bitter joke.

Victor Kiam keeps threatening to take the patriots out of New England. I"ll
help  you pack, Victor, and take the fans with you.
