And to think that only a few short &gt;mumble&lt;s ago, I blithely dashed off
an ish before embarking on a much-needed vacation! Ha! The Georgia sea
islands were blissful, if somewhat cold for the ideal winter vacation.
Even in the chill gray fog, there's a serenity and beauty there that
defies description. I could reel off the new birds on my life list, I
could reel off the delicious meals, the invigorating walks, the dizzying
variety of shells, the richly satisfying companionship of like-minded
fellow guests, but I think I'll just mention the souvenir that I brought
home. A jewelry designer named Gogo lives on the island. She makes the
most beautiful things out of semi-precious stones and animal bones, of
all things. One of the other guests had a beautiful necklace made out of
dolphin disks, and some earrings, made out of rattlesnake ribs with
chalcedony. I did not resist, needless to say. I bought a pair made of
large beads of African landscape jasper with rattlesnake vertebrae. They
give people the hoohahs, so I have been calling them my power earrings.
I walk into a meeting and the dude with the tie says, "Oops, J.B.,
the Hoodoo Woman is here again. Give her whatever she wants."

And then of course I spent the rest of March sewing and making cucumber
sandwiches and salmon mousse and tiny little lemon curd tarts with
strawberries on them and cheese straws and seed cake. I gave one serious
tea party to celebrate my attaining the age of reason. I am now,
and have been for weeks, forty years old, yay!

Other than that, we just put on the old Marx Brothers Broadway hit
Animal Crackers at our local little theatre. The other morning I
shot an elephant in my pajamas. What he was doing in my pajamas I'll never
know.

Well, that's enough about *me*, now what have you been up to since
I saw you last?

First, a couple of signs seen on Amherst street in Nashua (more humor like
this could almost make the road driveable!)

On a new chicken restauraunt located on the other side of the new
barrier - one which is difficult to cross...

        "Chicken - worth crossing the road for!"

Almost across the street was this sign,

        "Think spring.
                Think harder!"

And for those of you who have spring fever and are fed up with
meetings in dark windowless conference rooms, we offer this alternative;

Hi Judi,

We need a room tomorrow, 2pm, with a conference call telephone.

I've scheduled an appointment with Vermont Creative Software's technical
representative at that time.  If you can't get a room with a phone, get us
a stretch limo with ski racks and we'll all head up to Vermont.  If we make
the meeting quick we can be on the slopes by 10am.

Thank you.

            WISH I HAD TIME FOR JUST ONE MORE BOWL OF CHILI

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Remember Ben Feldman's anguished request for the old chili recipes issues?
Well, DELNI::GOLDSTEIN and ULTRA::PRIBORSKY were born with extra packrat
genes, and they came through in fine style. ULTRA::PRIBORSKY's personal
name, by the way, is "That's the stuff dreams are made of." ULTRA doesn't
say whether the personal name is connected to the chili recipes, however.

I don't reproduce the recipes here; there are dozens, and highly
entertaining they are, too. If you'd like to see them, send mail to
BOOKIE::NEILSEN and I'll forward them your way.

   ELECTRONICALLY AMPLIFIED BRAINWAVES FROM THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT

To:     DESPERADO
Subj:   For consideration...

Now then, about glass harmonicas ...  The instrument was invented by
Benj. Franklin, who also invented almost everything else that's useful.
It consists of a series of glass bowls of graduated sizes, mounted through
holes in their centers, on a horizontal shaft that is in turn mounted in a
pretty wooden case.  The shaft (and bowls) are arranged to be spun by a
power source from below--originally, it was a treadle like that on an old
sewing machine, which is itself a much more recent invention and has no
part in this narrative.

The harmonica is played by allowing the slowly spinning bowls to rub under
moistened fingertips, and "eerie" is a good description for the sound.  (It
was often referred to as "ethereal," which is equally apt.)  If you've ever
run your finger around the edge of a crystal wineglass and made the glass
ring, you have an idea what the harmonica sounds like; consider several
notes being played in chord.

In addition to the moderator's Donizetti citation, there are also Beethoven
and Mozart works for the harmonica; these works are often played today
using, of all things, a *flute*!  Harmonica players a couple of centuries
ago had a very short performing career.  Their fingers soon became tingly
and numb; it was thought that the vibrations had an adverse effect on the
nervous system.  Much later, it was discovered that the culprit was the
various colors of mercury-laden paint with which the bowls were striped to
distinguish one from another.

For the truly adventurous musician, glass harmonicas are again being
manufactured, right here in the US. Gerhard Finkenbeiner has a shop in
Waltham, Mass.  He's building the things and advertising them on WCRB
radio in Boston.  The adverts have music in the background; it just
might be worth listening to WCRB for several mornings in hopes of
catching the sound.  Finkenbeiner provided the set of crystal bowls that
were used by the Apple Hill Chamber Players a year or so ago in their
wonderful performances of George Crumb's "Voice of the Whale."  By the
way, he isn't using mercury-bearing paint...

A friend visited Finkenbeiner's shop and was shown how to play the
instrument by Vera Meyer, who is quite good.  (She's the performer in the
radio commercials.)  Technique consists, first and foremost, of washing
your hands.  A lot.  The slightest trace of finger oil is enough to keep
the glass from ringing.  I learned that bit of lore years ago when my Dad
taught me to ring glasses--after you've drunk all the wine you want, you
use the rest as a finger wash to break the oil.

      -&lt; thoughts on DECulture from Harris Sussman, Corporate Personnel &gt;-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I received this in my mail and thought it was appropriate to this topic...

(Posted here with the permission of the author.)

&lt;... Many forwarding headers removed ...&gt;

From:   CELICA::SUSSMAN      "Corporate Personnel, 251-1277"

May I share some thoughts on DECulture:

All peoples think of themselves as the original People.  That's
good for their survival, for the development of their collective
ego structure, their skin toward the outside world.

A culture that is stable is one thing, but even that is increasingly
rare.  The Tasaday tribe in the Philippines was a hoax.  The Amish
are being developed out of existence.  In the movie "The Gods Must
Be Crazy," the arrival of a Coke bottle disrupts the life of the
Bushman.

It may be instructive, if a bit startling, to use these examples.
Those are some of the parallels I see to our discussions of
Digital's culture.  DEC, the culture, is spoken of in tandem
with Core Values, in the same tone as one might speak of Moses
coming down from the mountain carrying the stone tablets or in the
same way Australian aborigines chant about Dreamtime.

This tells me something about where Digital is, historically, in its
cultural self-reference.

We are at a time when the precepts of the Founders are harder to
discern.  There was a time when everyone heard, shared, and created
the precepts at the same campfire, so to speak.  (In this case,
it was the same parking lot, the same bar, and the same woods
meeting.)  Then they were transmitted  by word of mouth, oral tradition,
legends, parables, folklore, (memos) that served to elaborate, refine
and reinforce the Message.  This was the culture.

And fewer of us are carriers of the culture.  There are the elders of
the tribe, those of the First Generation, who have known no other way
of life than the one of Digital.  They are the Original People.  There
are the people who were close to them, like those who went on the Long
March with Mao.  They lived it and lived to talk about it.

There are those who don't know if they lived it or heard stories so
vivid and appealing that they might as well have been there.  At any
rate, they have joined their history and memory to those of the
Original People, and by extension they have perpetuated the stories.

This went on for some years.  I don't want to overdo it, but I don't
want to minimize it either.

But something happened, as it does to any culture that cannot remain
self-contained.  Its points of contact with the Barbarians increased,
and it became subject to the influence of forces beyond its control.
Its culture became a hybrid as other influences intermingled.

This is precisely the juncture at which psychic, political,
institutional and social strain begins to show, and is reflected in all the
artifacts of the culture--its music, its architecture, its religion, its
crafts...its products and processes.

When someone comes into Digital, we have an initiation rite.  We
tattoo them: we give them a Badge.   This is like knowledge of the
secret handshake: it gives them Access to the Network.  I believe
this is the most coveted perk of belonging to Digital.  It is what
we guard most jealously.   It is what we defend with all our might.
It is our most valuable asset, the Ring (as in Wagner and Tolkien).

It is this that marks someone as part of the Society, the Brotherhood,
the Family.  Everyone else is Other, the outsider if not the
Competition.

It used to be, I surmise, that there was a more efficient process of
bonding.  (Stories abound of encounters with KO.)

Be that as it may, for the past 3 years or so, Digital has been
making new Badge-holders of some 25,000 people a year, or 100 a day.
I call these people immigrants.  I am one of them.  And it is increasingly
the luck of the draw as to whether these newcomers subscribe to the
tenets of the Original People.

What this means is that the culture is not being transmitted in any
particular way.  The transmission is increasingly two-way.  It is my
contention that Digital's culture (taken as the Founding Way) is subject
at least as much to the Other Ways of the immigrants as they are subject
to it.

This means that there are more people very new to Digital than there are
who were part of the Long March.   For an increasing number of Digital
employees, the clock-tower is unintelligible.  Some deeper things follow from
this:

* The culture is an amalgam.  It may be up for grabs.
* There is no systematic, conscious, method of indoctrination/orientation.
* There are more people who might know the words, but not the tune.
* The self-presentation of Digital as a little New England mill town
  company is quaint, and also perhaps counter-productive.
* We do not have a grasp on our own reality any more.  (For example,
  there is no common knowledge of how many countries Digital operates in.)
* Digital HQ and Corporate functions can no longer get away with the
  worldviews, mindsets, career perspectives that once served them.
* Because there is less internalized acceptance and agreement on the
  precepts of the culture, we cannot count on them being exercised.
* The company cannot get away with its official assertions and levels
  of expertise going unchallenged, either by those who don't know the
  unwritten rules and pecking order, or by those who know different,
  and know better.
* Digital's culture is rapidly becoming a polyglot combination of its
  suppliers', customers', temporary and part-time employees', cultures as well.
* Digital's culture is increasingly taking on some of the characteristics
  of its competitors' culture.
* Digital's culture is increasingly not that of a little New England
  mill town company, and there is no way of cycling enough people through
  the Mother Church (the Mill) to inculcate in them the feel, and
  the spirit, of bygone days.

All of this adds up to a review of Digital's culture that recognizes its
new reality. Some would say the culture has been watered down, that
hallowed traditions are in danger of being lost. Some would say it is more
dynamic and pluralistic, which is a fancier way of saying the same thing.

Many of the cliches about Digital no longer hold, and yet we hear
people saying them.

I happen to believe in some of the features of Digital that are parts
of its culture and I want them preserved and perpetuated.
I put it in different ways perhaps, but you must allow for my immigrant
dialect.  I think Digital (the collective super-ego) fosters what
I call distributed autonomy.  This is, as most of these precepts are, a
statement that operates on many levels.  Some people call this
peer-to-peer communications.  It suggests a degree of self-direction,
initiative, ability to contribute to an interdependent relationship, honesty,
openness, trust, mutuality, self-knowledge, self-respect, generosity: it is
a projection of the Founders' ideal.

Not everyone is ready for this, or the consequences of it.

Digital has made a virtue out of necessity.  It makes people responsible
for managing their own careers and for defining their jobs and for
understanding the contribution of their work to the whole--as if that
were knowable.

Nobody, no institutional mechanism, is in place to do it for you.  This
is unnerving for some people.  Most simply burrow into their cost center
of the moment and mind their own local piece of business.

People who can't function effectively in a setting of distributed
autonomy are dysfunctional to basic premises of the company, not only to the
premises of its internal organizational behavior, but also to the premises
of its external product strategy.  Yet there are such people.

How are they acculturated?  And how do they act, dialectically, to
acculturate others?

There are many examples that could be used.  My point is that this is
a two-way street.  What rubs off is a reversible equation.  The culture
needs to figure out how to preserve itself even while it is changing.

Subj:   COMMENTS ON CULTURE

        I found your thoughts on DEC culture perceptive, but a little
scary.  Is this what we have come to?  Is this the real DEC, split in
half, fragmented, and full of isolated individuals that feel they
missed out on the beginning, somehow can't get connected, can't share
the old stories about KEN walking the halls on Saturdays in the Mill?

        Well, let me share some of my stories and my perceptions having
lived a lot of it for the last twenty plus years.

        When I first got to DEC, in the spring of 1967, there were about
two thousand people worldwide wearing those Digital badges you spoke of.
The first thing that came to mind was, I wish I had been here two years
ago! Some of us, even then, felt out of place, distant, unconnected.  What
was the culture, and how could I fit into it.  We were hiring about
twenty-five to thirty people a week back then, and that seemed incredible.
We still shared the mill with other companies.  When you took the elevator
up and down, you would pass these other companies.  Our only interactions
were smiles and waves in passing. They did however, always seem to have
better vending machines.

        The average age was about twenty-two or three, and it was the
sixties, so the culture within DEC at the time was one of business, and
one of rebellion.  Some of us were missing the war, and some were able to
show the scars of war.  In any case, the majority of individuals were
young, most of us were making money for the first time in our lives, and
a lot of us were misplaced souls from around the country trying to start
out in life and have some fun.  Most of us were single.  We worked hard
and we played hard.  We grew up together, fooled around together, got
engaged, got married, fooled around, got in trouble, as one big wave
growing within DEC.  We changed from long hair,cords,and short skirts
to short hair and three piece pin striped suits for all of us.

        The things that held us together were both business and personal.
We knew each other and those that we didn't know were automatically
accepted because we were growing up together.  We didn't see
competition, we were leaders in a industry and we worked mostly with
the scientific community, everyone was either an engineer or a technician,
or trying to be one. Our mentors were old, at least thirty-five, some as old
as forty, with real grey hair and everything.
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Hey! Watch it!
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The Marketing and Sales people were also engineers, but were trying on a new
role.  We had windows for air conditioning, oil on the floors that many
of us slipped and fell on, and spiders that fell on our heads when they
sprayed the mill, we fished out of the windows, made blow guns from
conduit (help from the M.I.T dropouts), rode around on fork lift trucks,
our offices were simple fiberboard sheets with staples holding them
together, some had trim strips and some didn't.  I saw people come for
interviews and leave saying that they would never work in a dump like
this.  It looked pretty good to us. This is were we worked and played.
This is were we spent our days, nights, weekends, trying to design
and build products.  This is were we came back to after being in the
hospital for exhaustion, after working till we dropped.  This is the
place were we busted into the stockroom over the weekend, because we
needed the parts to put in a last minute change. This is where we used
heat guns to cook our suppers, so we could keep working.

        This was the place that when there wasn't any work, we sorted
screws, swept parking lots, painted lines, read technical manuals, or
were moved to other groups to help until things picked up.  This was
not the place were we had to worry about getting kicked out, or getting
pink slip surprises late on friday afternoons.  We felt like part of
the business, we put in our time, our energy, our youth.  We were
committed to the company and the company was committed to us.  This was
understood through actions, not on documents.  We were not told, we were
shown, through everyday interactions.  If we had spare time, we were
sent for training, everyone needed to learn more, no one knew where this
business was going, we just knew we were going together.

        I talked to an individual a few weeks ago and he told me that
DEC was out of control, that there was no way that we could manage
moving from 125 thousand people to 150 thousand people without falling
apart.  I laughed, and said that when I started there were two thousand of
us, and that now there were 115 thousand of us, and I was still here.
That we were still making it, and that we knew how to grow because we
never stopped growing.  His picture in time was just that, and five
years from now he would probably be telling someone else the same thing.

        DEC has a culture, but it didn't stop years ago like most people
believe.  We are in it now, becoming a part of it, adding to it. These
are the good old days. The new people just have to stay around long
enough to see it.

        Our company has changed over the years and I assume it will
continue to change throughout time.  We have learned a lot together
and some of us, who have been around longer, will tell you that we
wish a few things didn't change.

        Those things are honesty, and integrity.

        There are too many people today who lost or missed a couple of
norms we had in the past, and relied upon day to day.

        When we were in trouble, we told someone. We didn't hide things.
We asked for help and help would come.  When we made mistakes, our mentors
would pick us up, dust us off, smile and send us onward.  Today if
someone fails, we put them out to pasture, some come back, some don't.

        When we plan our projects we tell people what they want to hear,
not what it will take.  We let people do this and then we blame them later,
instead of sharing our historical knowledge of how long it really takes,
and guiding them out of trouble.

It used to be O.K. to say "I screwed up and need help."  I haven't seen
anyone admit that in years. at least not early enough to help them.

        I can remember when we said we had hired too many business
graduates; it feels like we hired to many financial grads, now.

        In closing let me say that DEC has a culture, and if you stay
around long enough you will understand it, not because you talked to a
lot of the old folks, but because you became a part of it, lived it
slept it, loved it. The legend is the mystique, and like any legend some
people go looking for it.  As for the clock tower, is it working yet?

My message to you is not as clean, i didn't spend a lot of time fixing the
spelling, and grammar
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
That's okay. I took care of it. What's an editor for, anyway?
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
because I'm here on a Saturday doing what I need to do, to keep us
competitive, profitable, and in business for the long haul. That's the DEC
way! A piece of the culture.  I don't have all of the distribution lists
that you have, but I challenge you to send this message out to the same.

I keep reading and rereading these two entries, trying to make sense
out of it. On the one hand CELICA::SUSSMAN talks like somebody from
Corporate Personnel, perhaps a refugee from WGBH? There's a certain
tone of superiority and self-satisfaction in those polysyllables.
On the other hand, ENOADM::CHAPMAN talks like a grizzled veteran
around the campfire. Why does Walter Huston in The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre come to mind? But the more I read them, the more
similarities I see between them. SUSSMAN is looking, and CHAPMAN
has some ideas about where to find it. That CHAPMAN can speak with
such energy and passion of the values that we must share is a powerful
recommendation. No amused and distanced analysis there! I found parts
of CHAPMAN's discussion unbearably moving. I remember the Mill too, and
I remember fending off sparrows during a job interview there!
But wanting to discover the culture of this large and ungainly
company and to preserve the ethos (just another word for culture, after all)
-- that's also part of the DEC culture; we've always tried to get
a handle on what makes this place creak along (it's spending 80%
of your time trying to attain market distinction with the last 20%
of functionality, as it happens, but I'm feeling cynical today.)

Don't try to overanalyze it; culture is what happens when you're
making other plans.

    This is the result of the efforts of the Corporate Identity Committee,
    a sub committee of the Executive Committee. Their work is on-going and
    as more sections are completed, they will be issued to the Manual
    holders for inclusion. Europe has been a strong contributor to this
    program, and a number of the standards have been developed by, or with
    major input from, Europe.

    With a corporation the size of Digital, we must take our Company
    Identity very seriously and it is incumbent upon all of us to play our
    part and implement those sections of the guidelines appropriate to each
    of us.

    Over the next few weeks and months you will see this being put in place
    in stationery, signage formats, etc... Please note that we will migrate
    to the new standards without destroying any of the current supplies
    such as business cards and stationery. We want to respect all company
    standards, yet without incurring additional costs.

    Company Name

    With regard to our Company Name and Company Logo, this MUST be treated
    as sacrosanct. We must always refer to the company as DIGITAL EQUIPMENT
    CORPORATION or DIGITAL and never use the word DEC when referring to the
    company. DEC is a trademark of Digital Equipment Corporation and is
    used in conjunction with products (DECmate, DECsite, DECWORLD, etc...)
    just as is the trademark VAX!

    Until now, we have been somewhat "flexible", but he have no longer
    reasons to mix DIGITAL and DEC, as this will help us all and at all
    levels, to reinforce our identity and recognition.

CRAY - A traditional Shinto ceremony was performed at Cray's systems
    check-out building in Chippewa Falls to introduce a protective
    spirit into a new X-MP/24.  The ceremony was requested by Century
    Research Center Corp. (CRC), the Japanese service bureau that
    ordered the system.

    There were two purposes to the ceremony:  to help protect the
    system during shipping and to ensure that it will run smoothly once
    it is installed on site.  "The ceremony places a spirit in the
    computer that ensures the company will prosper as customers use
    the system." (Tony Hagiwara, manager of the shipping firm that
    will deliver the system to Japan.)

    The Shinto ceremony traditionally is performed in Japan as a kind of
    blessing for significant events, such as an important purchase or
    the dedication of a new building.

    Ceremony participants included:  the President of Cray Research Japan,
    Cray's Coordinator of country services, Cray's Director of marketing
    support, the President of CRC, the Director of CRC's systems
    engineering division, and an employee of the shipping firm.
    Each participant laid an evergreen branch on the table before the
    computer system, bowed, clapped hands twice, and bowed again.  When
    all had finished, the six participants each had a cup of sake and the
    brief ceremony was over.

    An easel with the names of Cray Research and CRC written in Japanese,
    was brought from Japan for the ceremony.  It will return to Japan
    with the Cray system and sit nearby the system once it is installed,
    so that the spirit will continue to guard the system, helping keep
    its operation trouble-free.

        This seminar focuses on how Digital Equipment Corporation
        reviews and selects different documents to be stamped "INTERNAL
        USE ONLY."  In particular, this seminar explores the increasing
        trend to stamp everything this way.  This explains why you now
        get junk mail that must be shredded.

        Future directions include the stamping of food service menus and
        paper towels.  A new implantable chip from Hudson is presented
        that allows management monitoring of employee vocalizations,
        with programmable automatic disconnect of the employee's mouth.

Subj:   Virus attacks Desperado today

Today, I'm afraid I must confess that one of my recent postings to Desperado
contained a Virus that Therry (no doubt inadvertently) distributed to the
Desperado audience.  The virus doesn't infect your programs or data files
directly, but in a manner analogous to the "Christmas card" virus discussed
here a few months ago, it causes increased network traffic.

As the virus establishes itself, you will note its affect by the
increased amount of electronic mail you receive every day.  For some
of you, the increase is linear; but for others, I'm afraid you're
on the early part of a exponential curve.

Although the virus was easy to create, I'm afraid that I don't know how
to cure it.  In fact, I believe I'm beginning to note its effects on
my own system.

Humbly,

Martin Minow

Subj:   Great new way to raise money

    The following is the text of a news article from the April 13, 1988
    issue of the Lawrence (MA) Eagle-Tribune.

        FAKE FUND-RAISER BRINGS IN $243,120

        FORT WORTH, Texas -- Radio disc jockey Ron Chapman
        has $243,120 he does not know what to do with.

        He collected the money during a three-day pretend
        fund-raiser that aired on KVIL radio the day before
        April Fool's Day.

        Chapman asked listeners to send in $20 checks. He did
        not say why.

        In three days, listeners sent in 12,156 checks, Chapman said.

        The station has not yet decided what to do with the money.

Subj:   Mike Collins is my hero! (For DESPERADO)

    In article &lt;3535@cbmvax.UUCP&gt; eric@cbmvax.UUCP (Eric Cotton) writes:

&gt;In Mike Collins' (the APOLLO 11 CM pilot) book CARRYING THE FIRE, he
&gt;relates the crew's fear that even a slight trajectory error in their
&gt;course back to Earth could result in the CM skipping off the atmosphere,
&gt;and becoming lost forever.  There would not have been a second chance.

    Speaking of Mike Collins, I just returned from an astronomy-oriented
cruise on which Mr. Collins was a guest lecturer.  When asked, "what subjects
should a prospective astronaut concentrate on in school?", he replied, "You
probably expect me to say Math and Science.  Wrong, study ENGLISH.  There
are many brilliant engineers and scientists out there who simply cannot
communicate.  If you wish to distinguish yourself, develop your language
skills."  Something for space-campers and other would-be astronauts to ponder.

Subj:   Musical Criticism for Desperadi

        Among musical Desperadim  there must be  those who can  pause in
        their urban frenzy to appreciate the rustic critical  wisdom  of
        one Edwin Earle,  wafted,  so to speak,  to  us  valley  toilers
        from the Winter fastness of  Mr.  Earle's Green Mountain redoubt
        by  The  Chronicle,  a  newspaper published  weekly  in  Barton,
        Vermont.    One expects  a  rough-hewn  sturdiness from  such  a
        source, so omit  pretending you're reading some  such perfection
        as The New Yorker.

        Opera - "An overpowering weakness"

        by Edwin Earle

            'In America, as you know, most male writers fail to
            reach the age of sixty, or if they do, they have
            nothing more to say, but occasionally they say it
            anyway.'  James Thurber

        I hardly remember when I was 60, and  when I was, I was never
        asked to say anything  about opera, but I take  this occasion
        to say it anyway.  I know  little about music and hardly more
        about  opera, but  I listen  to it  sometimes.   On  Saturday
        afternoons  I try  to be  faithful to  public radio  and  the
        Metropolitan Opera from  New York.  It  is as close as  I can
        get, give or  take 400 miles,  to the action.   Last week  or
        sometime recently they broadcast 'Das Rheingold', the first of
        the Richard Wagner  ring cycle, It  was wonderful if  you dig
        Wagner.  My one-time neighbor Harley Ames said, 'If you stick
        a pin in a woman, she will  sing Grand Opera.' Harley did not
        dig opera in any  form.  Richard Wagner took  his music drama
        seriously, but he sometimes  didn't know when to stop.   Much
        of it is hardly  more musical than a talk show,  but is heavy
        drama and several times  I arose from my chair  and said, 'My
        god!  Just listen to that  brass.' No sacrilege was intended.
        I am sure that the Lord listens to music when He can.

        I listened in rapt attention to my opera, not missing a note.
        When at last the applause came, I discovered that somehow the
        second act and  two imternissions had  slipped by without  my
        knowing.  It was  truly opera at its most  overpowering and I
        was overpowered.

        Opera may be  a family weakness,  for my parents  attended in
        Boston when  Boston had  its own  company and  thought it was
        cultured.  Later the  city built its own opera  house way out
        on South Huntington Avenue,  which was second to none  at the
        time.  Subsequently,  it was torn  down and became  a parking
        lot.  What a  fate for an impossible dream.   In my time, the
        opera  house  stood  high  on Huntington  Avenue,  and  every
        extravaganza  of the  day played  there.   The Chicago  Opera
        Company in  the heyday  of its  glory included  Boston on its
        winter tour.

        Now opera, like other pageants,  needs extras called 'supers'
        who do not  sing but increase  the mob and  perform bit parts
        carrying  spears  and  such.    They   received  a  dollar  a
        performance and competition was great, not for the money, but
        for the chance to see the show from the inside out.  Hopefuls
        would  line up  at the  stage door  by mid-afternoon  in  the
        bitter  winter cold  for admission  one hour  before  curtain
        time.  The door  was opened only for the number  needed.  The
        disappointed  would go  home to  thaw out.   After  two  such
        disappointments,  I wrote  my most  appealing letter  to  the
        general manager  saying that  I was  a poor  art student  who
        loved opera.  His surprising reply  brought me a working pass
        with admission to all performances in Boston.   I tried to be
        modest in my triumph as I walked past the shivering hopefuls,
        to  have the  stage door  opened for  me alone  five  minutes
        before the time.   My first performance  was in Moussorgsky's
        'Boris Gudonov' with  Theodore Chalyopin as  Czar Boris.   It
        opened with all  the imperial grandeur  of a czarist  Russia,
        with the booming of great bells and  a full orchestra.  I was
        coached and  costumed to  precede the  Czar.   The thundering
        ovation given the great Chalyopin made  me the most conceited
        page in all of Boston.  Later, I concealed myself in the wing
        and became all misty-eyed as he intoned a most pathetic dying
        farewell to his little son.  To  have been in the presence of
        Chalyopin,  possibly the  greatest basso  of all  time, is  a
        touching memory.

        Opera  became  a  festival  in  those winters  of  my  youth.
        Imagine a  boy who  had never  mastered his  do-re-mi in  the
        presence of such glorious music.

       The smoothness in  which such a complex  juggernout moved was
       most impressive,   but  accidents   were   not  infrequent.
       Martinelli delivered his opening aria  in Rigoletto and fell on
       the floor.  Seized by  indigestion, he was quickly dragged off
       the  stage where  a  doctor attended him.   Immediately replace
       by his  understudy, the audience may never have been aware of
       what happened.  In Carmen,  Mary Garden was about to take  the
       third  act opening.   The  stage was  crowded  with performers
       and I  was assigned  one of  three horses.    The orchestra
       struck up the 'Toreador' song and the curtain rose, Miss  Garden
       entering  downstage.   There was  a crash  as  a sandbag
       counterweight practically  exploded upon hitting  the floor.  The
       curtain came plunging down, narrowly missing Miss Garden.    My
       horse  reared,   and confusion  was  rampant. Management soothed
       the audience  and stage hands sprang  to action juryrigging a
       rope.   In ten minutes the curtain rose and Miss Garden entered
       downstage.  The show must go on."

My two great-aunts sang at the old Met, and grandes dames they were,
too. Aunt Miriam once asked my ten-year-old father what his favorite
opera was. He quickly replied "Das Rheingold!" to which Aunt Miriam
replied, "No,my dear, it is Die Valkyrie." Must have inherited my
unrepentant Italianism from my grandfather, whose favorite was La
Boheme. (But Earle's right -- that Rheingold was boffo!)

This letter appeared in a recent edition of the Herald-Journal, a large
newspaper in Syracuse, New York.  I don't know the date because all I got was
a xerox:

"Expectations of Robertson" - letter to the editor by George J. Fagan,
Sarasota, NY

        "In the hurly-burly of the campaign, most of Pat Robertson's unique
qualifications for the presidency are being overlooked or possibly concealed
by the media.

        "It should, for example, be obvious to the truly thoughtful voter
that Pat is specially qualified to reduce the national budget drastically.
A man who has the power to deflect a hurricane from Virginia Beach can without
much effort deflect mere manmade missiles, turning them back to strike the
"Evil Empire," thus obviating the necessity to expend multi-billions on SDI.
And a man who can detect the presence of nuclear weapons in Cuba, when our
satellites and the CIA cannot, will eliminate the need for immense outlays on
the gathering and analysis of intelligence.

        "Once he has taken up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he
could reorganize the Cabinet structure drastically.  The secretaries could,
naturally, become ministers.  With Oral Roberts as Minister of Health, Jerry
Falwell as Minister of Education, the Bakkers as Ministers of Treasury and
Commerce, and, in a generous gesture combining bipartisanship and Affirmative
Action, with Jesse Jackson as Minister of Foreign Affairs, who could ask for
anything more?

        "Millions of jobs could be freed up and unemployment eliminated by
returning women to their proper sphere of children, church, and kitchen.
The problems of drugs and AIDS could be solved by making all culprits a head
shorter.

           THIS ISN'T DISTINGUISHED SOCIAL COMMENTARY?

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I just want you to know I'm crushed. Not only did I not get promoted
to Vice President, but I didn't win a Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished
Social Commentary. Not that I'm jealous of Dave Barry or anything.
It just seems hard that I've been toiling over a hot terminal for
three years turning out Desperados with the help of your distinguished
selves and nary a nomination has crossed my desk. Millions for defense,
but not one red cent for tribute.
