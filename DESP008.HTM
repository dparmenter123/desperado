Today's Boston Globe  (27-Oct-1982)

Digital Equipment Corp., one of the nations premier computer manufacturers,
reported its first quarter profits declined 36 percent in the period ended
October 2, the first earnings slump in seven years.

The Maynard-based minicomputer maker, which has avoided the shoals of
recession so far, announced earnings of $56.8 million, or $1.02 a share,
compared with $88.8 million, or $1.60 a share in the comparable period a
year ago.

Digital reported a 10 percent revenue gain to nearly $927.5 million for the
quarter compared with $839.4 million recorded in the year ago period.

The earnings decline was anticipated by the company and Wall Street
security analysts, and some analysts believe Digital will continue to
experience profit pressures through the second quarter.

Profits were hurt by substantial new product development and startup costs,
related advertising and marketing programs associated with a personal
computer series and reduced product pricing, Alfred M. Bertocchi,
vice-president of Finance and administration, said.

Comany sales were flat except for the VAX-11/730 computer system, two new
mass storage devices, the personal computer series, and office automation
products, said Bertocchi.

...

Digital reported spending $101 million in research and development
expenses, or 10.9 percent of its first quarter revenues.  That is about $27
million more for research and development than the comparable period last
year.

The company also reported having $760.4 million in cash and cash
equivalents for the quarter.  At the end of fiscal 1982, it had $764.67
million, a company spokesman said.

                        --------------------

Also reported in the Globe today:

Gulf Oil Corp. reported a 54 percent drop in 3rd quarter profit yesterday
while two other oil companies reported smaller declines.

Standard Oil of California reported a 13 percent drop, Shell Oil reported a
6 percent profit decline.

And Ford Motor Company reported a $325 million loss for the 3rd quarter and
blamed it on slumping sales and the high cost of introducing new products.

Sudden recall. Another line-never-to-be-believed:

"Of course I'll respect you in the morning."

There is another line, but inasmuch as it deals with a sexual
practice not sanctioned by Senator Helms or practiced by Phyllis
Schlafly, I am loath to broadcast it over Desperado.

Also,

"This'll hurt me more than it'll hurt you."

"You won't need novacaine for this."

"It's not loaded."

"Suggestions for improving [whatever] will be greatly appreciated."

There is actually a published book of these, titled something like "The Three
Biggest Lies".  It gives the Big Three for a variety of subjects.

Other than the famous "Your check is in the mail", most of the best ones I've
heard are raunchy, including the immortal:

        Of course I'll still respect you in the morning!

and the all-time classic:

        I won't **** in your *****.
