YOUR CO-WORKER COULD BE A SPACE ALIEN, SAY EXPERTS

        ... Here's How You Can Tell

                By Michael Cassels

                        -- from a recent National Enquirer (of course!)

Many Americans work side by side with space aliens who look human--but you
can spot these visitors by looking for certain tip-offs, say experts.

They listed 10 signs to watch for:

        1.  Odd or mismatched clothes.  "Often space aliens don't fully
understand the different styles, so they wear combinations that are in bad
taste, such as checked pants with a striped shirt or a tuxedo jacket with
blue jeans or sneakers,"  noted Brad Steiger, a renowned UFO investigator
and author.

        2.  Strange diet or unusual eating habits.  Space aliens might eat
French Fries with a spoon or gobble down large amounts of pills, the
experts say.

        3.  Bizarre sense of humor.  Space aliens who don't understand
earthly humor may laugh during a serious company training film or tell
jokes that no one understands, said Steiger.

        4.  Takes frequent sick days.  A space alien might need extra time
off to "rejuvenate its energy,"  said Dr. Thomas Easton, a theoretical
biologist and futurist.

        5.  Keeps a written or tape-recorded diary.  "Aliens are constantly
gathering information," said Steiger.

        6.  Misuses everyday items.  "A space alien may use correction fluid
to paint its nails," said Steiger.

        7.  Constant questioning about customs of co-workers.  Space aliens
who are trying to learn about earth culture might ask questions that seem
stupid, Easton said.

        "For example, a co-worker may ask why so many picnic on the Fourth
of July," noted Steiger.

        8.  Secretive about personal life-style and home.  "An alien won't
discuss domestic details or talk about what it does at night or on
weekends," said Steiger.

        9.  Frequently talks to himself.  "A space alien may not be used to
speaking as we do, so an alien may practice speaking," Steiger noted.

        10.  Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near
certain high-tech hardware.  "An alien may experience a mood change when a
microwave oven is turned on,"  said Steiger.

        The experts pointed out that a co-worker would have to display most
if not all of these traits before you can positively identify him as a
space alien.

Just thought you might like to add a little story to the color-blindness
incident:

A few years ago I was working for a small consulting firm specializing in
doing "High Technology Projects in Developing Countries" (bringing computers
to people that with dirt roads and agricultural economies.  The
project at the time was to install a large computer center (Burroughs
mainframe, HP minis, data entry machines...) for the government of
China in Beijing. All of this was funded by you and me courtesy of
U.S. donations to the United Nations Development Programme.

Anyhow.. we had gotten all of the export licenses and the hardware (DEC just
didn't know how to put together a competitive bid) and I flew over to do the
site inspection about a week before the machines were supposed to show up.

The Chinese had followed my instructions perfectly, and the computer center
had been built exactly to specifications. Everything looked fine... they even
got the raised floor right this time (the last one collapsed). I finally got
around to inspecting the electrical wiring and EVERYTHING was wrong. All
wiring was supposed to have been done according to international codes, but
here half of the wires were correct and the other half were completely screwed
up (seemingly at random).

I couldn't figure it out (that had been so meticulous on everything else) and
then I got a hunch. I cut off a length of each of the wires (red and green no
less) and brought in the electricians. I tested each one and found more than
half of them were red-green color blind!! I had the other ones redo the
incorrect wiring, and everything turned out fine.

I found out later that color blindness is much more prevelant in China than it
is here.

Subject: Strange Laws............

        I was reading in the Boston Globe a few weeks ago, that in
the city of New Bedford,Mass., it is illegal to carry your pet snake
in public.  Seems an individual was taking his 10' ptython for a stroll,
and scared a women half to death.  The woman complained to her City
Councilman, and the law was passed.....

Oh, it is also illegal to bring a whale into the state of Kansas.  Really!
Seems back in the late 1800's, a circus promoter managed to obtain a
dead whale, and placed same on a cart, and toured the carcass thru the
country.  In Kansas, the dead whale reeked so much, the circus promoter
left the state, and whale behind.

mention the Connecticut law (or was it Missouri?) that stated that
when two trains meet on a track one shall not back up until the other
does so.

        What was the motivation for the derogatory comment
        about Aztec in that desperado memo?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, it's like this.  The Aztec dual disk drive has a fixed and
removable disk mounted on the same spindle, a low-cost high-capacity
medium, but designed (as I was saying) without any thought for what
the software would do with it.  In the first place, you have to stop
the fixed disk in order to remove the removeable disk.  I asked, 'Why
no clutch?' but they laughed.  Anyway, removing the removeable disk
requires that the operating system go into a state called 'stall-I/O'
which is the absolute reverse of what operating systems are all about.
The system has to hang on to all its I/O until the disk gets spun back
up and then do it all at once.  And, backing up an Aztec requires a
series of operations reminiscent of ferrying the fox, the chicken, and
the grain across the water.  First you take the chicken across and
then you come back and get the fox and take the chicken back and then
you take the grain across and then you go back and get the chicken.
A good debate topic:  should the fixed or removeable disk be the
system disk?

That was the motivation.

     Subj: The REAL emergency at Digital

     Ken Olsen's recent memo on the "emergency" at DEC has  spawned  a
     lot of discussion.  Although the memo cites real problems, I feel
     that it misses the global issues.  We don't have an emergency but
     a  disaster;   the plane went down a long time ago.  The disaster
     is corporate-wide and runs from top  to  bottom.   Unfortunately,
     DEC management is still looking for the plane while our customers
     have already booked on a competitor's flight!

          I have been at DEC now for 10 years  this  month,  and  have
     seen  the company transformed in many ways.  Despite what we tell
      ourselves or read in the trade press, we have gone from  a  small
     friendly  company  to a large unfriendly one.  The company is not
     responsive  to  its  employees  or  its  customers.   I  sense  a
     tremendous frustration from our engineers.  Many excellent people
     have already  left  --  many  are  just  waiting  for  the  right
     opportunity.   I  can't  hope  to  define  all  of  the company's
     problems, nor can I suggest remedies.   However,  it  is  crucial
     that  we  be honest about our problems and the weaknesses that we
     have.  Following are, from my biased engineer's  point  of  view,
     some of the major problems.

          1.  The company suffers from a lack of leadership.   Digital
     needs a leader to establish our corporate goals and determine our
     strategies.  For the last several years, it's been  unclear  what
     business  we are in, who we're competing with, and what our model
     of the future is.  People in the company have lost confidence  in
     upper  management.  Digital was formed by people who had a vision
     of the future.  Now we see managers with only  a  vision  of  the
     past.

          2.  We have an incredible ignorance about our  own  business
     and  marketplace.   The computer industry has been revolutionized
     over the past 5 years.  I'm constantly amazed at  the  number  of
     managers  and  engineers alike who have no idea what is CURRENTLY
     available from our competitors.  We're still  designing  products
     for  the  70s  while  everyone else is well into the 80s.  If you
     haven't taken a good look outside of Digital  for  even  2  or  3
     years, then you don't know what's going on.

          3.  We have a protectionist attitude towards  our  products.
     We're  so  afraid  that  someone  else  will  make  money  on our
     computers;  we would rather turn down a million dollars than  let
     someone else make a nickel.  We didn't allow people to easily add
     hardware and  software  to  our  PCs,  so  they  have  difficulty
     competing.   We  didn't  allow  another company to build a PDP-11
     microprocessor (or VAX for that matter) early in the game, so now
     the  Motorola  68000  and  Intel  8086  are the industry standard
     16-bit machines.

          4.  We have  a  misplaced  sense  of  our  position  in  the
     computer  industry.   People think that we have some super power:
     that if we decide not to make a product, nobody else  will.   Ken
     argued  that mangers don't want computers on their desk -- now an
     IBM desktop computer is a status  symbol.   Recently,  those  who
     prefer  VMS to Unix argued that we shouldn't support Unix because
     it would legitimize the "little guys".  Now IBM  is  aggressively
     attacking  our  university  market  with  Unix  on 4300s, AT&amp;T is
     supporting Unix as the basis of its new market thrust, and  we're
     the  little guys running to catch up.  The point is, nobody cares
     whether   we   like   personal   computers,   Unix,   mice,    or
     high-resolution  displays;   these  things  are  requirements for
     competing in today's marketplace.

          5.  We're afraid to change with the times.  Our  failure  to
     build  a  workstation is a NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT.  Our lack of a
     product in this space is no less a threat to DEC than our lack of
     a 32-bit computer was in 1975, but nobody seems to care.  We have
     lost the confidence of much of our high technology customer base,
     including  universities.   The  success  of  the  VAX-11/780  has
     crippled us into thinking that all computers  must  look  like  a
     780.   We  could  have  made hundreds of millions selling systems
     based on the Motorola 68000, but we couldn't see the  writing  on
     the  wall  because  of  our  bias for the VAX and VMS.  Note that
     IBM's failure to see a new  market  spawned  a  new  industry  --
     minicomputers;   our  failure to see a new market has spawned the
     workstation industry.

          6.   We  have  an  organization  whose  goal  seems  to   be
     prohibiting  the  marketing  and  manufacturing  of new products.
     Everywhere you turn in Digital people are  telling  you  why  you
     can't manufacture in less than 2 years, why you can't go into new
     markets, and why what you're doing doesn't make sense.  I  had  a
     product  manager  for  workstations  tell  me over dinner that he
     didn't believe in local area networks or  single-user  computers.
     How could he possibly help us get into the workstation business?

          What do we do?   First,  recognize  that  the  industry  has
     changed.  Digital no longer has a monopoly on the construction of
     computers.  Any two guys in their basement can build a system  as
     fast  or faster than a VAX-11/750, and can get venture backing to
     market it.  Therefore, Digital must compete as  never  before  in
     quality,  cost/performance,  and  time  to  market.  Software has
     changed also, and  along  with  it  customer's  expectations  for
     software.    We   can't   outproduce   the  myriads  of  software
     applications companies.  Therefore, we must  make  it  easy  (and
     interesting) for them to produce software for our systems.

          I think that we're in a vicious cycle:  DEC  is  not  making
     interesting  products  and  so it is unable to hire top technical
     people:  because we can't hire top technical people, we're unable
     to  build  interesting  products.  I think that DEC needs a major
     change in attitude.  This change must be initiated from the  top.
     There  must  be  a  commitment to COMPETE in the marketplace.  We
     cannot sit on our VAXes and think that we'll be OK because  we're
     DEC.   Nobody  is  guaranteeing  that  DEC  will  survive without
     competitive products.

          I think that lots of DEC's engineers would love to hear  Ken
     make a statement like:

               Digital  has  always  been   a   leader   in   the
          construction  of  computer  systems  for  sophisticated
          technical users.  We have made systems that  were  used
          and  highly  respected  by those customers.  During the
          last several years, our position  in  this  marketplace
          has  slipped.   As  of  now,  we  are  making  a  major
          commitment to renew our  leadership  in  the  technical
          computer  industry.   We will not be prejudiced by past
          successes  or  failures.   We  will   once   again   be
          cost/performance  leaders,  and  we  will  use whatever
          technologies we need to take us to the future.

          The DEC I joined in 1974 was a highly-respected manufacturer
     of  technical  products.   Our products were used for research in
     industry  and  universities.   New  ideas  were  tested  on   our
     equipment.  People developed new systems, such as Unix and Tenex,
     on our equipment.  An entire generation of engineers, scientists,
     and  programmers  was  educated on our computers.  Now those days
     are gone.   The  next  generation  is  being  educated  on  Suns,
     Apollos,  and  yes, IBMs.  I think we need to return to our roots
     -- to making computers that technical  people  like  to  use.   I
     think  that  I  speak  for many engineers when I say that I don't
     want to work for Burroughs, CDC, Honeywell, or NCR.  Many of  our
     people have left already.  Is it too late to change?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I don't know if I buy the whole argument.  The idea of making it
easier and more interesting to develop applications for our systems
could take us a lot of places our 'old' market never took us.  And, if
technical people like to use our computers, well, the people who write
applications are technical people.  Let's help them out.

What really gets me is that so much of what he describes is what I
see.  And he is out west and I'm down in Maynard.  As the old saying
has it, 'One sip tastes the whole sea'.  He put his dipper down in
Seattle and came up with a cup of the same salty brew that I can dip
up by the bucket back east.

I've had a lot of fun at DEC but the motto I learned when I came here
in 1978 was 'Do the right thing' and it's getting harder and harder to
do.

I'm still having fun, by the way, and I see plenty of interesting
things to do, but I'm worried.

So, are we living inside a dead dinosaur?  Or what?  I think the
creature's still alive.
