                     Student Center Becomes Beach
                            By DAVID FOX
                        Associated Press Writer

   EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) - In bikinis and baggies, the college
students built sand castles and played volleyball, enjoying a day
at the beach - 15 tons of sand dumped in their student lounge.
   It was dreary and about 40 degrees Thursday at Southern Illinois
University, but it was still time to forget exams, wind chill and
cold capsules and to dig out surfin' records and head to the Goshen
Ocean.
   For the third time since 1980, students turned the the center's
Goshen Lounge into a makeshift beach, holding swimsuit, muscle-man
and sand castle-building contests and, generally, forgetting winter
for a day.
   "The idea is that we're in the dead of winter, it's pretty
dull, and we're in the middle of winter-quarter studies,"
university spokesman Sam Smith said. "This is just a way to bring
a little enjoyment into the students' lives at a very dreary time."
   It seemed to work. Six students wearing floral shirts, shorts
and moist sand between their toes built castles as hundreds
cheered, and occasionally groaned when a tower would topple.
   Across the beach, Mary McIlvoy of Granite City lay on a towel
under the florescent lights and studied calculus, seemingly
oblivious to the rock 'n' roll music and volleyball game in front
of her.
   "I probably won't get any studying done," said the 21-year-old
junior. "But who cares? It's fun, something different."
   The beach party originated in 1980 as a successor to the annual
winter festival on the SIU campus here.
   "At the time, they talked about 10 tons of sand, sail boats and
palm trees ... since most people don't like winter," Smith said.
"It was quite successful.
   This year was no different, with people standing 10-deep around
the plastic-lined lounge area filled with sand.
   "We only had two for the sexy swimsuit (contest), so we had to
invite the guys to enter, too," said Kathy Klein, the event's
student coordinator. "You're pale at this time of year. You don't
want to show off your body when you look like that!"
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I myself have just signed up for a session with a local tanning parlor's
Facial Machine, which imparts a delicate glow to the features, and reduces

Subj:   Guests's quotes

From Frank McGowan, on the distinction between Creole and Cajun food:

    To quote that well-known culinary authority, Pete Barbuti, "Creole
    food is made by putting a lot of living things into a pot. When
    they're all dead, you eat. Cajun food is just like Creole food,
    only older."

    Pete is the same guy who plays blues piano with his
    rather prominent nose, and, prior to performing this feat, points
    to the Steinway and says, "For all you folks out there in Kansas,
    this here's a piano. Bet you never saw anything this big didn't
    have 'John Deere' written on it!"

"Texas Crude" by Ken Weaver

    Ken Weaver, 42, has been in the Air Force, played with the '60s
    rock band the Fugs and worked in the oil fields of Texas, his home
    state, where he gathered these jewels from Lone Star tongues. "I
    worked with geniuses in the oil fields," he says. "They didn't
    know anything about Chaucer, but Chaucer whould have loved them."
    He now studies Russian and linguistics at the University of
    Arizona. -- Joe Kane.

Okay, gang, it's nostalgia time.  Remember all those luscious recipes your
mother used to cook, like Coke-basted ham and Twinkie cake?  Yeah, me too.
Well, there's one that nobody who ever came in contact with it can forget.
So, for the amusement of all and sundry, especially any WWII veterans, I offer
the following, quoted verbatim from US Army TM10-405, GPO, 1942:

                        DRIED BEEF, CHIPPED ON TOAST

        2 pounds fat, butter preferred
        1 pound flour
        4 13-ounce cans evaporated milk
        4 gallons beef stock
        7 pounds chipped or sliced beef
        2 bunches parsley, chopped fine
        1/2 ounce pepper
        130 slices bread, toasted

        Melt fat in pan and add flour.  Cook a few minutes to brown flour.
        Add milk and beef stock, stirring continuously to prevent lumping.
        Add dried beef and cook 5 minutes.  Add parsley and pepper.  Serve
        hot on toast.

Now if there is some poor masochistic soul out there who would like the home
version of this gem, let me know and I'll dig it up for you.

Subj:   THE YASSIR ARAFAT LOOK IS FINALLY "IN"!

        (From Forbes, 10 March 1986, Page 8)

The close shave is out, the three-day beard is in, sparked by Don Johnson,
star of TV's *Miami Vice*.  To cash in on the fad, San Francisco
songwriter-chief Robert Warner, 37, approached Sterling, Ill.'s $50 million
Wahl Clipper Corp. in January with an idea for Miami DeVice, a beard
trimmer that lets men keep their stubble at one short length.  Wahl already
had five-length beard trimmers with gradations of up to 5/8-inch, which had
more than doubled the company's consumer division sales since 1983. Now it
plans to pay Warner royalties for the Miami DeVice name.  (The new model
will keep the beard shorter and grungier.)  After repackaging, it will be
test-marketed at $25 to $30.  "We probably won't sell it much to the
regular office worker, whose boss or wife won't like the three-day look,"
admits Wahl's marketing director, whose name, believe it or not, is B. J.
Cornstubble.

        A Scots kilt was originally made from 9 yards of material, which
        was bought in a 3 ft. width, and made from pure wool - hence, all
        wool and a yard wide.

        To economise on the material, instead of triple pleats at the back
        of a kilt, it was found that double pleats gave the same appearance,
        but only used 7 yards of material, and could be made from inferior
        cloth.

        My kilt (hand made for me by the Kiltmaker to the Scots Guards) is
        "all wool and a yard wide", and also, "the full nine yards".

I seem to remember that when you were an Avon lady, a whole batch of

    True stories:

    As a high school science teacher, I asked some students to help
    clean out and repair the old alcohol lamps.  Remember those?  Labs
    that didn't have enough bunsen burner outlets had these little glass
    alcohol lamps with wicks.  There were several hundred of these things
    in the storeroom (this was a BIG high school: Maury High, in Norfolk,
    Virginia, with over 1200 students).  While most students pitched
    in willingly, several simply lounged around in the back doing nothing.
    After all the lamps had been trimmed and prepared, some of these
    lazy students asked me for new wicks, since the lamps they had been
    given didn't have any.  "No", I replied, "there is no wick for the
    rested."

Did you all see that article in the Sunday Examiner about yawning? Page 3
of the Sunday Punch section, in case you missed it.

Three clinical psychiatrists had a paper in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry
entitled "Unusual Side Effects of Clomipramine Associated with Yawning",
describing 4 patients who, while taking the the anti-depressant drug
Clomipramine (brand name Anafranil) reported the unusual side effect of
spontaneous orgasm every time they yawned.

The first case of this was a female patient who had been depressed for 3
months, but under treatment "Complete symptom remission occurred within 10
days". She then asked how long she would be allowed to go on using the drug,
since she had observed that every time she yawned she had an orgasm, and she
was able to experience orgasm by deliberate yawning.

Apparently it can work for guys too. One male patient said that while he
found the repeated climaxes "awkward and embarrassing, he elected to continue
the medication because of the therapeutic benefit he obtained. The awkwardness
and embarrassment were overcome by continuously wearing a condom".
