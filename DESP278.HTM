 If you like the drug war, you're just going to love it when nicotine
 is added to the list of illegal drugs. We already have armed
 smugglery bringing low-tax butts into Boston from North Carolina.  If
 nicotine is delegalized, it will take every nonsmoker in the country
 to enforce the law.

 "He was a New Yorker who joined the Air Force and was sent South and
 learned Karate and twenty-eight ways of killing a man with the
 nipples of your breasts, shorn of hair.  He thought that justice for
 all men was okay and why not justice for the colored man?  That's
 okay stuff.  He had outsold every insurance man in the state of
 Georgia.  He had killed the enemy in Guam in 1957 with piano wire
 thrice or more and he was prepared to show me how it was done.  He
 had defused bombs at Turner AFB that Cyrus Citizen would never know
 existed.  He had run down a Yugoslavian spy with a fire truck after
 watching him toss a napalm bomb into the cockpit of a plane that
 Alvin Average would never know existed.  'I meant to kill him.  That
 was orders.'" -- Jack Chatfield, field report, Southwest Georgia

&gt;  Well, yes, encrypt everything, and pay cash for everything while
&gt;  you're at it...

Hmm...  Maybe it's my natural exhibitionist tendencies, but I've always
liked the idea that maybe someone at the credit card company or in my
company's security is monitoring my purchasing or e-mailing habits.

I've always imagined some grunt worker stuffing my mastercard bill into an
envelope and checking out the geographical variety of the places I've been
charging, or the different kinds of stores I shop in or mailorder from.  Of
course, they're stuffed by machines with no ability to be impressed.  (Not
unlike many government beureacrats.)

I recently moved to a new apartment where I can effectively recieve UPS
packages.  I thought this would be a great relief, that I wouldn't have to
waste my time driving to the UPS center or have to haul heavy boxes of
weird shit on the El (Chicago public trans).  It is more convenient, but I
miss the awe of my colleagues at seeing me unpack a box of giant capacitors
or something and hear them say "what the hell are you going to do with that."

Subject: Encrypt everything

Tom --

&gt; Its time to start encrypting everything, no matter how mundane.

Gee, I just assume everything has been encrypted all along.  Why else
search for meaning in everything?  All that stuff in Desperado over the
years ... you mean it actually MEANS what it SAYS?

Now I'll have to revise my whole view of chili.

 Error message of the day:

&gt;Error transferring to GRUMPY mail.box; Server error: Cannot write to file
&gt;  (possibly it is READ-ONLY or the disk is out of space or not ready)

 That final flurry of duh possibilities notwithstanding, I think
 GRUMPY pretty well covers it.  The biggest drain on my Desperenergy
 is dealing with mail.  In this particular case, the mailer returned
 the entire last ish back to me without mentioning any error.  I don't
 want all the bandwidth, I just want all the bandwidth that my
 bandwidth touches, as Hitler put it.  Please, mailers human and
 software alike, please always include the full text of my messages in
 any error message you return me, lest my bandwidth jones not be fed.

In Re: things in bell jars and microwaves...

Wait till Easter (or Halloween when Easter candy shows up in the stores)
and get yourself some of those marshmallow Peeps.  Put one on a paper
towel and microwave it for about 30 seconds....Way better than
Peppermint Pattys!

    At lunch yesterday,  Alan Kotok was telling a war-story about how he
    once demoed a DEC-10 running Digital's first computer-synthesized music
    hack, to Lord Mountbatten of England, during a 1975-ish computer
    exposition in Britain.  General reminiscences about Mountbatten ensued,
    including his untimely death at the hands of IRA terrorists a decade or
    so back.  Jim Gettys recalled that he was, among other positive
    qualities, an inveterate gadgeteer and technology-wonk manqui, and
    Kotok added in proof that Mountbatten had actually understood the
    explanation of how the music was coded, synthesized, and produced...

    One of the other internet-freaks at the table said "It's a real pity he
    was killed -- he'd really have loved the Web."

       "True," I said.  "He could have been the Duke of URL."

JAVA JIVE
Sun CEO Scott McNealy sees using Sun's HotJava program to distribute free
software over the Internet.  The free software would be developed at
universities in exchange for donated equipment.  McNealy sees hundreds of
"20-year-olds in computer science labs, working all night on Jolt Cola and
Twinkies, who would be thrilled to death to create a better word processor
than Word and make it available for free."  (Financial Times 7/17/95 p.9)

[HotJava is the latest development of James Gosling, instigator of Sun's
NeWS, circa 1984-86 -- an early contender in the distributed UI space that
lost out to the X Window System. Like NeWS, HotJava features a prominent
role for executable code downloaded from a server and executed on a client.
Gosling seems to have a thing for that particular technique. HotJava might
be appropriate for distributing small chunks of code, akin to the "parts"
that make up an OpenDoc application; but I can't see how it's suitable for
anything like a modern, hyperbloated word processor.]

DISCARD AFTER 5,000 YEARS
Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed a data storage
technique that uses an ion beam to inscribe data in a space the size of 500
atoms and saves it for up to 5,000 years.  The technique has been used to
store the equivalent of 12,000 diskettes (or 180 CD-ROMs) onto a 1-inch
long pin of stainless steel.  (Information Week 7/24/95 p.12)

[A recent article in Scientific American (Jan. 95) made clear what librarians
and archivists have been discovering for years -- that electronic media just
aren't archival. The media don't last and the technology for producing devices
to read the media is also fugitive. Where do you inscribe the instructions
for building a needle-reader? Nothing lasts like paper (unless it's papyrus).]

DEVIANCE -- COMPARED TO WHAT?
Peter Huber, author of "Orwell's Revenge" and senior fellow at the Manhattan
Institute, points out that "community standards" are no longer definable in
cyberspace.  "'Deviance' loses its meaning, when communities of the
like-minded are formed entirely by consent.  Freedom of association is so
complete in cyberspace that traditional limits on freedom of speech become
almost impossible to justify constitutionally."  (Forbes 7/31/95 p.110)

[If this view gains adherants it could crimp the style of the Tenessee pro-
secutors who download offensive material from California bulletin boards and
then bring suit in Tenessee on community-standards grounds.]
