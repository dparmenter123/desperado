This is an old posting by an old friend and long-time "yucks" member.
Somehow, it got resurrected and here it is again (I hope I didn't post
it recently)!

BTW, I've tried some of these, and they *are* effective.

Furthermore, it's easy to have intense experiences.
You just have to think big.
Throw away all those crutches and boogaloo.

        next party

This must be an odd fellow.  I mean, maybe he has stretched all his bolts
already, his lack of an award at Cannes has dimmed his interest in Claymation,
the EPA's after him for using bitumenous coal in his lawn mower, and besides,
you can only wear one pair of lizard-skin socks or high-heeled shoes at a
time, but selling the SaladSpinner??  Has he lost his mind???

        Dear Mr., Mrs., or Ms Customer,

        It has come to our attention that the weasel/marmoset assemblies
        delivered with our Runstibitzer 2040 Version 2.19-A-QZ-9.44234-Z
        fail to preform as designed.  In keeping with our commitment to
        customer satisfaction, we are contacting all owners of this model
        to inform them they are on their own as we are getting out of
        the business.  Officers of the Runstibitzer Corporation may be
        reached care of the American Embassy in Bolivia after 12-SEP-1990.

        NOTE:  Failures of the weasel/marmoset assemblies are invariably
        fatal to those in the immediate vicinity of the Runstibitzer 2040.

        The following events may occur during or precede any weasel/marmoset
        assembly failure:

             High-pitched, metallic screaming followed by powerful explosions

             Silver-blue bolts of extreme high-voltage electricity emanating
                from the 2040 and grounding on nearby furniture or personnel

             A sudden, ominous silence during operation

             Apparently normal operation

        Should you experience any of the following symptoms when operating
        the Runstibitzer 2040 Version 2.19-A-QZ-9.44234-Z, we suggest you
        sit on the floor, spread your legs, and kiss your ass goodbye.

        We take this opportunity to express our gratitude for your
        past patronage of Runstibitzer line of fine electronic components.

Subject: New Look and Feel case
To: eit@athena.mit.edu

In a surprise move today, Judaism filed suit against the Catholic Church,
claiming Catholocism copied the "look and feel" of the religion.
Judaism, which has held the patent on the concept of a mono-theistic
religion for over 3500 years as well as the copyright on Yahweh(R), The
Old Testament(C), and the use of "CH"(tm) for the "H" sound, is suing for 2000
years of back royalties.  They are also asking that the court disallow
the use of the term "Judeo-Christian" from all textbooks.

The Pope was unavailable for comment, but a spokeman from the Vatican
stated the suit was unfounded as the patent on the concepts shared by
the two religions has long expired, and that the suit violates the
separation of church and state.  More news as the case develops.

Well, I try to keep mine from getting too boring.  The following
recordings seem to have been enjoyed by most of our callers.  Fun
recordings just take a little imagination and a little time.  Anybody
else got any good ones they'd like to share? (BTW, Dave is my roommate,
and Waldo is our cat.)

"Hi, this is Gene.  Neither Dave, Waldo, nor I can come to the phone
right now.  We're being detained by the authorities due to a
misunderstanding about some underage sheep.  If you'll leave your name,
phone number, and the time of your call after the tone, we'll get back
to you just as soon as we can post bail.  Baaah-baaahh."

"Hi, this is Gene.  Dave, Waldo and I are currently on Neptune helping
to thwart an invasion by the evil lizard men and their sinister
companions, the brain moles.  If you'll leave your name and number
after the tone, we'll get back to you as soon as we return
victorious....or as soon as the drugs wear off and reality reasserts
itself."

"Hi, this is Gene.  Dave, Waldo and I aren't exactly here exactly now.
We're out testing a new time machine.  If you'll leave your name and
number after the tone, we'll get back to your as soon as we return.  In
fact, if the test is successful, we may even call you before we leave!"

"Hi, this is Gene.  Dave, Waldo and I are on a secret mission with the
galactic patrol and we can't answer the phone.  Since call forwarding
doesn't extend outside the solar system, we've set up this little
miracle of modern electronics.  Just recite your name, phone number,
and planet of origin after the 'beep', and we'll call you back upon our
return."

At Christmas:

"Ho, ho, ho!  This is Santa.  Dave, Gene, and Waldo can't come to the
phone right now because they're out practising pulling my sleigh.
It seems those new elves I hired were actually fairies, and all my
reindeer are down with AIDS.  The boys have agreed to pull my sleigh in
return for my not releasing the photos which illustrate why they're not
getting anything but coal in their stockings this year.  Leave your
name and number after the tone, and I'll unhitch them and have them
call.  Merry Christmas!"

And for the next few weeks:

"Hi, this is Gene.  Dave, Waldo and I can't come to the phone right
now, because we're taking a hypnotism lesson.  But you don't mind,
because you're feeling so relaxed.  Your eyelids are feeling heavy and
you are getting very drowsy.  You're asleep.  After you hear the tone,
you'll leave your name and telephone number.  Then you'll hang up and
mail us all your money.  Then you'll dress up in a rubber chicken suit
and gather twigs to build a nest in your front lawn.  After that, we'll
either return your call or visit you in the home."

The first really big use of those "equally meaningless in all known languages"
symbols was at the World's Fair in Montreal (1970 or thereabouts).  They used
an obviously male figure, standing arms akimbo, as the symbol for "men's
room".  For "women's room", they used an obviously female figure, standing
in the same position.

Question:  What was the woman doing?

Our Encore Multimax just crashed in a way that seems like poetic justice:

    On the console terminal appeared a fragment of somebody's paper about
multiprocessor interconnection networks.  The last readable sentence was:

    "...it is difficult to build shared memory procesors
    "
    "^%%^$#$%#%$#it is difficult to build shared memory$%#%$#it is difficult to
    "build shared memory$%#%$#it is difficult to build shared memory$%#%$#it is

Almost too good to be true :-)

    The chaos that tends to engulf couples steeped in wedding
    preparations has been dramatically groomed by a software program
    from newlywed Chris Irwin, La Mesa, Calif. The $20 Wedding Organizer
    shareware product stores guest invitations, creates 'to-do' lists,
    and provides a budgeting spreadsheet to keep track of costs. In
    addition, the program plays "The Wedding March" when booted,
    displays a famous quote on marriage at the top and each screen, and
    provides users with a G-rated wedding night tip before exiting.

Subj:   An architecture to end all architectures
[some forwards removed, but do we have an author?]
From:   STAR::PV1201::DUTKO "Nestor, VMS System Management Engineering

                AN  ARCHITECTURE TO END ALL ARCHITECTURES
                -----------------------------------------

        DNA (Digital Network Architecture), DSA (Digital Storage
        Architecture), VIA (VAX Information Architecture), PCSA
        (Personal Computing System Architecture), SMA (System Management
        Architecture), DDTA (Digital Distributed Transaction Architecture)
        ...What do they all mean?  If you are confused by the number of
        architectures you have to remember, hold on -- help is at hand!

        In one of the most significant strategic announcements of the
        decade -- and certainly the most elegant -- DEC has announced a
        framework within which all other architectures must be  developed:
        DAA (Digital Architecture Architecture).

        DAA is a response to questions like 'What is an architecture?',
        'When do you need one?', and 'What should it comprise?'.  Naturally
        it is not possible to give a full definition here, but briefly
        DAA defines a framework for the architecture in which it itself
        recursively provides the model architecture.  It is believed to be
        the first ever use of recursion at the architectural level.

        DAA also has a complete architecture developed toolset, including
        its own IPSE based on DECwindows and a conversion tool to assist
        in migrating existing architectures into the DAA model, although it
        is not yet clear whether customers will be able to buy them.

        This architecture architecture promotes DEC's ability to lead the
        industry in strategic developments to and beyond the year 2000.
        It is being applied to all branches of engineering worldwide.
        Existing architectures and products will be retro-fitted at their
        next major release, and 1990 will see more major architecture
        announcements than ever before.

        Such is the importance of this announcement within DEC, that existing
        products that end in 'A' (and therefore clash with the architecture
        naming standard) are being re-engineered.  For example, 'adapters'
        such as UDA and DEUNA will become 'interfaces', namely UDI and DEUNI,
        respectively.  Products such as VPA (VAX Performance Advisor) will
        become VPE (VAX Performance Expert).

        The future of longstanding products such as ADA is still to be
        decided.  It is rumoured to be easier to get engineering budget
        within DEC these days for an architecture than for an actual product.

        Realistically, there will be little short-term benefit to the
        userbase at large.  However, DAA provides a plank to support future
        developments.  It enhances DEC's current strategic architectural
        domination over IBM, which is believed to have formed a task group
        at the highest level with a brief to close the architectural gap.
        DEC will almost certainly rub it in by proposing DAA as an ANSI/ISO
        standard.

        And if you were able to peek inside DEC's furthest out research
        projects, you would get a hint of its game plan for the ultimate
        domination of the strategic architecture market.  As other vendors
        attempt to introduce their own rival architecture architectures,
        DEC will trump them all with an overall architecture to encompass
        and embrace all other architecture architectures.

        If this audacious attempt succeeds, the computer world of the 21st
        century really will belong to DEC.  If you look back 20 years from
        now, you will realise that 1st April 1989 was the turning point.

        DAA DEFINITION OF AN ARCHITECTURE

Architecture definition:A framework within which the subject
                        will be developed.
Naming Conventions:     Architectures must start with 'Digital'
                        and end with 'Architecture', and must
                        have a TLA (Three Letter Abbreviation),
                        or ETLA (four to five letter Extended
                        Three Letter Abbreviation).  In addition,
                        the TLA or ETLA must be unpronounceable to
                        ensure it is not an obscene word in any
                        language.
Architecture scope:     The scope of each target architecture will
                        be recorded on an architecture database within
                        DEC to ensure there is no overlap between rival
                        architectures.
Interfaces:             The boundary and interfaces between target
                        architectures is tightly controlled to
                        ensure full consistency and orthogonality.
Compliance:             Every architecture will be tested for
                        compliance with the Architecture Architecture
                        by a new compliance group within DEC. (A
                        strange omission is that there is as yet
                        no check that an actual product complies with
                        its own architecture).

Subj:   2 Live Crew jury laughs at witness for prosecution

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla (AP) --- Jurors in the 2 Live Crew obscenity trial
laughed Thursday as a flustered detective stumbled through her
testimony, unable to understand a tape she made of the group's rap
songs.

The officer had recorded the allegedly obscene Hollywood, Fla., concert
that led to the arrest of three band members, who were charged with
violating community standards of obscenity by singing about oral and
anal sex, among other things.

Broward County sheriff's Detective Debbie Werder was one of eight
undercover vice officers who taped the June 10 performance.
Proasecutors asked her to play a few seconds of the cassett tape, then
tell jurors the lyrics.

She had trouble understanding the scratchy recording and repeatedly
asked it to be played over.  Jurors, who worked through lunch, were
clearly irritated, shaking their heads and laughing.

``The isn't the type of music I listen to every day,'' Werdner explained
to the court.

The misdemeanor charges against Luther Campbell, Mark Ross and Chris
Wongwon could bring yearlong prison terms and fines up to $1,000.

On Wednesday, Judge June Johnson gave jurors permission to laugh in
court after some of them confided that their efforts to keep from
laughing during some testimony had left them aching.  The jurors had
sate stone-faced during the trial but were seen doubled over in laughter
in the hall.

    Sex &amp; the Bomber
     'Northrop Takes Offense at New Stealth Condom'

        The Northrop Corp. has taken legal action to prevent a
    Texas company from marketing a new product Northrop says
    might be confused with its B-2 Stealth bomber.

    The product: Stealth Condoms.

        In opposing the company's application for a trademark,
    Northrop contends that the use of the name "is likely to
    cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive" people
    in the marketplace.  It does not specify how this confusion
    might occur, or how dire might be the consequences of such a
    confusion.

        Northrop also charges that the Stealth Condom slogan
    could bring the military hardware manufacturer, and its
    products, "into disrepute."

        The slogan?

Subj:   stealth

        TAYLOR, Texas (UPI) -- Northrop Corp., the giant defense contractor
which makes the B-2 Stealth bomber, is trying to shoot down a tiny
Texas-based business -- Stealth Condoms.
        Los Angeles-based Northrop has taken legal steps to deny John Hughes'
application for a trademark for his kitchen-table business.
        Hughes, 28, who says he's trying ``to put some fun back into condom
buying,'' is selling a red, white and blue condom in a cardboard package
resembling a Stealth bomber.
        But after he applied for a trademark last year, Northrop's attorneys
filed a petition with the trademark office to block the application.
        ``If they stop my trademark -- if they can -- we're out of business
automatically,'' said Hughes. ``They know I'm not a big company. If they
make me spend enough money, sooner or later I'm history.''
        The attorney representing Northrop declined to comment without the
company's permission, and Northrop officials were unavailable for
comment.
        The petition filed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board said
Northrop believes it will be damaged by the trademark for Stealth
Condoms because ``its use by applicant (Hughes) is likely to cause
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.''
        Hughes, who also has a tile-laying business in Central Texas, said
his condoms have a better reputation than Northrop's airplane, which has
been the subject of much debate in Congress.
        ``The condoms perform better than the bomber,'' he says. ``Our
package will even fly over 40 feet -- they don't do well in wind, though.
They're totally radar-proof, can fly low and don't require a great
length of runway to land.''
        Hughes said even if the government became confused and spent $865
million on his product instead of buying a Northrop bomber, it might not
be such a bad deal.
        ``I could provide an incredible amount of protection for that kind of
money,'' he quipped.

I thought some here might get a kick out of this.  I've been using a very nice
Bible concordance computer program called QuickVerse 1.21 from Parsons
Technology.  Recently they offered me an upgrade to QuickVerse 2.0 which I
promptly took and recently received and installed.  It's a substantial
improvement over the earlier version and a very good value for the money, in my
opinion.  There was just one problem with my RSV upgrade.  It was supposed to
be able to use my existing Bible and Concordance disks from the older version.
Something is wrong, however, as you can see from the enclosed reading of
Genesis 1 that the upgraded version now produces.  I called Parsons and they
are quickly working on a fix to the upgrade.  Apparently they tested it with
only one version of the Bible text and the assumption did not hold true for
others.  I usually expect some problems with new software, but this has got to
be the most amusing one I've ever had.  Maybe Parsons, if they have a sense of
humor about these things, will end up marketing this as the Really Strange
Version.

  Genesis 1 (RSV) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. {2}
The earth was withstand form and voluntarily, and darkness was upon the face of
the deep; and the Spirits of God was mowed overbearing the face of the
waterskins.  {3} And God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. {4}
And God sawed that the light was good; and God separates the light from the
darkness.  {5} God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Nighthawk.
And there was evening and there was mornings, one day. {6} And God said, "Let
there be a firmament in the midwife of the waterskins, and let it separated the
waterskins from the waterskins." {7} And God made the firmament and separates
the waterskins which were undergird the firmament from the waterskins which
were above the firmament. And it was so. {8} And God called the firmament
Heaven.  And there was evening and there was mornings, a secret day. {9} And
God said, "Let the waterskins undergird the heavens be gathered tohu into one
placed, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.  {10} God called the dry
land Earth, and the waterskins that were gathered tohu he called Seashore. And
God sawed that it was good.  {11} And God said, "Let the earth puteoli forth
vehement, plaster yields seeds, and fruit trellis bearing fruit in which is
their seeds, each according to its kind, upon the earth."  And it was so.  {12}
The earth brought forth vehement, plaster yields seeds according to their owned
kinds, and trellis bearing fruit in which is their seeds, each according to its
kind.  And God sawed that it was good. {13} And there was evening and there was
mornings, a thirds day. {14} And God said, "Let there be lights in the
firmament of the heavens to separated the day from the nighthawk; and let them
be for sihon and for seat and for days and yellow, {15} and let them be lights
in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so.
{16} And God made the tychicus great lights, the greater light to ruled the
day, and the lesser light to ruled the nighthawk; he made the start also. {17}
And God seth them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth,
{18} to ruled overbearing the day and overbearing the nighthawk, and to
separated the light from the darkness. And God sawed that it was good. {19} And
there was evening and there was mornings, a fourth day. {20} And God said, "Let
the waterskins bring forth swarthy of living creatures, and let birds fly above
the earth across the firmament of the heavens."  {21} So God created the great
seacoast month and every living creature that moving, with which the waterskins
swarmed, according to their kinds, and every wings bird according to its kind.
And God sawed that it was good. {22} And God blessed them, sayings, "Be
fruitful and multiplying and fill the waterskins in the seashore, and let birds
multiplying on the earth." {23} And there was evening and there was mornings, a
fifth day. {24} And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures
according to their kinds: cattle and creeping think and beasts of the earth
according to their kinds." And it was so.  {25} And God made the beasts of the
earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and
everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God sawed
that it was good. {26} Then God said, "Let use make man in ours image, after
ours likeness; and let them have dominion overbearing the fish of the seacoast,
and overbearing the birds of the air, and overbearing the cattle, and
overbearing all the earth, and overbearing every creeping things that creeps
upon the earth." {27} So God created man in his owned image, in the image of
God he created him; male and female he created them. {28} And God blessed them,
and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiplying, and fill the earth and
subdued it; and have dominion overbearing the fish of the seacoast and
overbearing the birds of the air and overbearing every living things that
moving upon the earth."  {29} And God said, "Behold, I have given young every
plantations yields seeds which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
trees with seeds in its fruit; young shall have them for food. {30} And to
every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that
creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every
green plantations for food." And it was so.  {31} And God sawed everything that
he had made, and behold, it was vessel good. And there was evening and there
was mornings, a sixty day.

is, save that it must be the subdomain jvd.msk.su

Maybe nobody but me cares about this, but I'm pleased as punch to get
mail from the Soviet Union. I've tracked down the path. The mail took
this route to get to me:

                I KNEW HIM BEST AS A BOUNCING BABY BOY
              AND APPARENTLY HE'S STILL HANGING IN THERE

Subj:   Bungee jumping

Tom,

I read the part on bungee jumping in the last issue of Desperado with
interest. I went on a little excursion with the Bungee Adventures crew
a few weeks ago, and had the pleasure of throwing myself off a construction
crane with elastic cords attached to my chest. Quite an experience (I
haven't told Betsey about this yet!).

By the way... Bungee Adventures isn't allowed to use the ballon for jumps
any more. The FAA shut them down because they didn't like the modifications
BA had made to the ballon's basket.

Yr gdsn,

James

In this case, "gdsn" stands for "godson" and I admit I once held this
intrepid system mangler in my arms and swore I'd raise him as an
Episcopalian if I ever had a chance.  The Betsey referred to above is
his dear old ma, who is safely away from California in Australia.

And, on that personal note, I'm signing off to head for the hills of New
Hampshire for my traditional Thanksgiving camping trip.

Stay tuned for some stuff about the Dean Drive.  Send me some stuff about the
Dean Drive if you have any and haven't sent it.

Yr bdy,
Tom Parmenter
