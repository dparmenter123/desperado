                            FLAG-BURNING UPDATE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    We burned two American flags on our Thanksgiving camping trip.  My
    brother Jim bought both flags at a yard sale in Texas back when he was
    a hippie.  Flags were a popular decoration in those days.  (A woman I
    know hitched all the way across the country in winter wearing nothing
    (nothing) but sandals, a coat, and a minidress made out of an American
    flag.)

    We'd been using one flag as our camp flag for eight years or so and it
    was pretty faded and stained.  We decided it was time for it to go.  So
    we ran up the newer flag and prepared to get rid of the old one.  As
    all flag tenders know, you dispose of a flag by burning.  So we built
    up a huge campfire and burnt it.  We all stood up and raised a cheer
    for the flag and the first amendment and it burned away beautifully.
    One guy sang the Marseillaise in French on the general principle that
    freedom was indivisible.

    As we were striking the newer flag at the end of the camping trip, we
    discovered that our fireworks had burnt two large holes in the new
    flag.  Quite spontaneously, we started singing the "Star Spangled
    Banner", picking up at the part about "the rocket's red glare".  And
    our flag did look a lot like the one from Fort McHenry.  So, now we'll
    be getting another flag and burning another flag.  We still haven't
    been forced to burn one to honor the first amendment.  I can wait.

Subj:   An Amendment for the 90's

Amending the Constitution is in vogue these days.  George Bush
 supports no less than 4---count 'em---4 amendments, 3 of which
  place restrictions on the 1st Amendment.

Since amendments are, as I said, in vogue, I'd like to propose
 a new one.  Like Poppy's, it restricts the 1st Amendment.  We
  should forbid anyone from publishing any sentence that makes
   reference to "the 1990s" (or its other form, "the '90s"; and
    anyone atttempting to write "the 90's" will be sentenced to
     work in the computer field).

As experience with past decades indicate, such sentences make
 little sense, and just serve to waste paper.  The environment
  ---in particular, the greenhouse effect---is emerging as the
   issue of the '90s.  Since trees help mitigate the problem,
    we want to use as few as possible.  As we move into the
     1990s, we have to make some hard choices, and this should
      be one of them.
       &lt;_Jym_&gt;

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
And, Jym, just what are the other two Bush attacks on the first amendment?
I know about the flag-burning one, of course.

And, just to be tedious, 1990 is one of the ten years of the *eighth*
decade of the 20th century and 2000 is the *last* year of the 20th century.
If I live that long, I'm going to suffer a lot, so I might as well prime
you all up for suffering along with me (if *you* live that long).

Other things not worth knowing that will cause you to suffer if you know
them:

    A "cap" has either no brim or just a bill.  It's not a "hat".  Each
    time I call a cap as a hat, I remember this.  Just after.

    "Cactus" is a word of Greek, not Latin, origin, so "cacti" is not its
    plural.  That leaves you with either "cactodes" or "cactuses".  I use
    the latter, but of course "cacti" is a favorite of the erudite.

Speaking of the Marseillaise, my son Dan believes that the reason the
French love Jerry Lewis so is that they think he is a perfectly typical
American, ignorant, goonish, clumsy, in ill-fitting clothes and moronic
mental trappings.  They also think, he opines, that Americans don't like
him because his satire is so cuttingly accurate.

Subj:   A possible desperadum?

I really didn't realize the extent of Yuppie Disease here in the burbs of
Eastern Massachusetts, until I read an article in the Action Unlimited of
October 23, describing a lecture, "sponsored by 17 area schools and
organizations":

  "Find out how parents can avoid the subtle sabotage of affluence".

I suppose this should make me content, since I don't think we have that problem
in my family.  ...unless there's another lecture on the subtle sabotage of
living paycheck to paycheck...

Announcement:

   On November 1, InteLex Corporation will release electronic editions
of the works of John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. These
works will be bundled with the most sophisticated search and retrieval
software yet developed for personal computers - Folio Corporation's
VIEWS.
   With the VIEWS program, every word of the text database is indexed.
VIEWS supports boolean searches (and, or, not), as well as wildcard,
literal string, nested, and proximity searches. In addition, VIEWS
supports hypertext linking: for example all of Berkeley's references to
Locke are linked by tokens, which allow the user to go immediately from
the Berkeley to the Locke. Finally, the VIEWS indexing process results
in databases roughly 60% the size of the original ASCII text files. The
contents of any window (including the opening window which contains the
entire database) may be output to disk (as an ASCII file) or printer.
   Minimum system requirements: IBM PC, PC AT, PS/2 and compatibles,
512K RAM, one hard drive, and one 360K, 720K, or 1.44MB flopy drive.
For MacIntosh systems, the text will be sold as ASCII, without the
Folio VIEWS system.
   InteLex is releasing the following texts, based on the editions

&gt;From today's New York Times:

    BRASILIA, Brazil -- With Brazilian presidential elections two weeks
    away, one of the country's most popular television personalities has
    suddenly entered the race, and a public opinion poll shows that he
    could win.
        The new candidate, Silvio Santos, a street vendor turned
    television showman, enjoys the allegiance of millions of Brazilians
    who tune in every Sunday to watch his 10-hour program of games,
    raffles, samba bands and scantily clad women.
        "What brings me to run for president is the obligation to serve
    our country, the determination I have to make my contribution and to
    return to the people a little of what the people have given me,"
    Santos said on Tuesday.
        In a nation where three-quarters of the households have television
    sets but only half of the 82 million voters have finished primary
    school, the possibility of Santos's candidacy was dreaded all year
    long by other candidates. His announcement on Tuesday threw the
    vigorously contested race into an uproar.

Can you imagine?  A brainless entertainer takes advantage of his popularity
with the uneducated populace of his country to seize control of its
political system.  Frightening to think of what a huge country could do
with someone like that at the helm.

Subj:   Complaints

    And I went to the bank and the pen was tied to the table by a cable
    that was short and twisted which made it hard to write with and I told
    someone at the bank it was hard to write with and they said, "We
    haven't had any complaints about it" and I said "What about me?" and
    they didn't say anything and the damn thing's still there.

The solution to this apparent paradox can be solved by simply
replacing the phrase "Well, we haven't had any complaints" with
"Nobody is going to blame ME for the problem that you're pointing out,
and I will not accrue any personal benefit by doing anything about it,
so why should I bother?".  Another shorthand synonym is "Don't blame
me, I just work here."

How to deal with the Avis person on the phone with her lawyer: you
must think in terms of making it worth her while to deal with you.
For example, reach over the counter and press the switch-hook button
on the phone, hanging it up, and make clear by word and deed that you
will be an awful nuisance, whom she can get rid of most easily by
renting you the car.  If that's too impolite for you, just walk over
to the Hertz counter, but in circumstances where there is no
alternative supplier handy, you must use what resources you have.

A new ethical low in the legal profession was set this year by Michael
Abbell, who advises the reputed bosses of Columbia's Cali drug cartel
on how to avoid extradition to the United States.  Until 1984, Abbell
headed the Justice Department's office charged with extraditing drug
traffickers.  The New Republic (Oct 23) describes this as "switching
sides in the middle of the game and taking the playbook with you."

phone call, and this is very important protection for them and for us -
otherwise, they would have to monitor every phone call and censor it as they
thought fit to protect themselves from lawsuits.  Just like TV!  This is what
is in store for us when the press becomes primarily electronic - censored,
controlled, safe, the realm of established money and power.
&lt;end quote&gt;

Good use of counterpoint -- clearly the most danger is presented by
electronic text editing.  I envy your subtlety in working that in.

     The Wonderful World of Nature

     There are moe sperm in the testicles of the indian elephant than
     there are Ants in the entire Gobi Desert. But each of those ants
     possesses within it is genetic blueprint of infinte complexity
     that is but part of a greater blueprint held within the entire
     species.

     This blueprint is, in itself, a genetic jigsaw of such astronmic
     elaboration that it would take a human brain nine feet in
     diameter simply to begin to comprehend it. Nine feet also happens
     to be the lenght of the gonad of the sperm whale.

     In on hour the sperm whale consumes plankton equivalent to the
     entire polar bear population in the last 10,000 years. 10,000
     years is also the time taken by the sand lizard to mutate into
     the Texas Blind Salamnder, and yet in the same time period the
     appearance of the king penguin has varied little as does the
     apperance of one ameoba from another.

     Such wonders, such variety. Boundless in diversity but united in
     the common bond of the life cycle. It is beyond us to understand
     why these things should be. What incredible forces should bring
     this wonderous kingdom of animals to life? From where do so many
     strange, unusual and incredible creatures come?

     So many questions, so much to marvel at, loads of different kinds
     of animals, so many numbers and sizes to remember. So many big
     facts about small animals to get in such a short column.

     Dear Dave,

         I am a great fan of your wonderful writing style and would
     like to offer you to try my latest recipe that I was given by a
     mate of mine who works for 'The Department of Transport'.

         This is an impressive dish which will appeal enormously to
     roads planners and architects, while causing untold havoc and
     misery to hundreds of local residents.

                             Baked Alaska

             Ingredients
             16 oz Icing sugar
             3 tons Cement
             40 Wrought-iron pillars
             3 oz Flour
             15 tons of creosote
             2 Eggs

     1. Mix the cement with water and beat in two eggs

     2. Spread the mixture evenly over ten square miles (make sure
        that you have planning permision, or at least a piece of paper
        that looks like you have) and leave for 30 mins

     3. While the base is still soft, add the wrought iron pillars t
        regular intervals while making as much mess and noise as
        possible.

     4  Heat up the creosote in a large-ish vat and sprinkle the
        flour in gradually until the mixture  resembles a large-ish
        vat of creosote.

     5  Now pour it onto the base until only th tips of the pillars
        are visable.

     6  Leave to dry

     7  Add some glace fruit if desided; this will have the effect of
        making the whole thing look stupid.

     8  Stand back and wait for a public enquiry.

     I can only recomend this recipe as it is the one that was used
     to build all the motorways in the UK.

      Disorder in the Court: a Collection of 'Transquips'
       by Richard Lederer

      Most  language  is  spoken  language,  and most words, once they are
      uttered, vanish forever into the air.  But such is not the case with
      language spoken during courtroom trials, for there exists an army of
      courtroom reporters whose job it is to take down and preserve  every
      statement made during the proceedings.

      Mary Louise Gilman, the venerable editor of the  National  Shorthand
      Reporter has collected many of the more hilarious courtroom bloopers
      in two books - Humor in the Court (1977) and More Humor in the Court,
      published a few months ago. From Mrs. Gilman's two volumes, here are
      some of my favorite transquips, all recorded by America's keepers of
      the word:

      Q.  What is your brother-in-law's name?
      A.  Borofkin.
      Q.  What's his first name?
      A.  I can't remember.
      Q.  He's been your brother-in-law for years, and you can't remember
          his first name?
      A.  No.  I tell you I'm too excited. (Rising from the witness chair
          and pointing to Mr. Borofkin.) Nathan, for God's sake, tell them
          your first name!

      Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in New York?
      A.  I refuse to answer that question.
      Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in Chicago?
      A.  I refuse to answer that question.
      Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in Miami?
      A.  No.

      Q.  Now, Mrs. Johnson, how was your first marriage terminated?
      A.  By death.
      Q.  And by whose death was it terminated?

      Q.  Doctor, did you say he was shot in the woods?
      A.  No, I said he was shot in the lumbar region.

      Q.  What is your name?
      A.  Ernestine McDowell.
      Q.  And what is your marital status?
      A.  Fair.

      Q.  Are you married?
      A.  No, I'm divorced.
      Q.  And what did your husband do before you divorced him?
      A.  A lot of things I didn't know about.

      Q.  And who is this person you are speaking of?
      A.  My ex-widow said it.

      Q.  How did you happen to go to Dr. Cherney?
      A.  Well, a gal down the road had had several of her children
          by Dr. Cherney, and said he was really good.

      Q.  Do you know how far pregnant you are right now?
      A.  I will be three months November 8th.
      Q.  Apparently then, the date of conception was August 8th?
      A.  Yes.
      Q.  What were you and your husband doing at that time?

      Q.  Mrs. Smith, do you believe that you are emotionally unstable?
      A.  I should be.
      Q.  How many times have you comitted suicide?
      A.  Four times.

      Q.  Doctor, how many autopsies have you peformed on dead people?
      A.  All my autopsies have been performed on dead people.

      Q.  Were you aquainted with the deceased?
      A.  Yes, sir.
      Q.  Before or after he died?

      Q.  Officer, what led you to believe the defendant was under the
          influence?
      A.  Because he was argumentary and he couldn't pronunciate his words.

      Q.  What happened then?
      A.  He told me, he says, "I have to kill you because you can
          identify me."
      Q.  Did he kill you?
      A.  No.

      Q.  Mrs. Jones, is your appearance this morning pursuant to a
          deposition notice which I sent to your attorney?
      A.  No.  This is how I dress when I go to work.

      THE COURT: Now, as we begin, I must ask you to banish all present
                 information and prejudice from your minds, if you have
                 any.

      Q.  You say you had three men punching at you, kicking you, raping
          you, and you didn't scream?
      A.  No ma'am.
      Q.  Does that mean you consented?
      A.  No, ma'am.  That means I was unconscious.

      Q.  Did he pick the dog up by the ears?
      A.  No.
      Q.  What was he doing with the dog's ears?
      A.  Picking them up in the air.
      Q.  Where was the dog at this time?
      A.  Attached to the ears.

      Q.  When he went, had you gone and had she, if she wanted to and
          were able, for the time being excluding all the restraints on
          her not to go, gone also, would he have brought you, meaning
          you and she, with him to the station?
      MR. BROOKS: Objection.  That question should be taken out and shot.

      Before we recess, let's listen to one last exchange involving a child:

      Q.  And lastly, Gary, all your responses must be oral.  O.K.?
          What school do you go to?
      A.  Oral.
      Q.  How old are you?
      A.  Oral.

  From your header, perhaps you are a bat freak?  We get them in our
building twice a year during migration.  I caught 20-30 in a 2 weeks
this fall - I catch them in nets, put them in boxes and release them
from the roof at sunset.  Our building is 200+ ft high, and I'm on the
top (17th) level, which is where I find nearly all of them.  I've got
people used to the idea that bats aren't bringers of death and destruc-
tion, and certainly not 'bugs'.   We have the largest urban colony of
bats right here in Austin, they live under a bridge by the river, and
are a great sight when they leave at dusk.  Bat Conservation Inc. has
its HQ here in Austin too.

Bats for ever!

bolted to foundations (an inadequate, piece-meal
solution that obviously discriminates against the poor)
to urging us to write to our local scientific institution
demanding research into bolting the continental plates together
with large, seismic sheer pins.  (If you think this
technology doesn't exist, just remember that this is just

Called it.  They claim to have prevented "another" earthquake last week.
This week's tip (paraphrased):  "Slow down your life.  Sociologists,
anthropologists, and psychologists claim that the pace of modern life is
unparalleled.  Rush!  Rush!  Rush!  People rushing to work, rushing home,
*even* rushing through meals.  All this rushing generates nervous energy
that some scientists say may be absorbed geologically.  So, to prevent
earthquakes, slow down, take time to smell the roses, maybe even drive
below the speed limit."

              NEWSPAPER WINS HONOR FOR BEST LIE OF THE YEAR

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - The national Liar's Hall of Fame cited the Des Moines
Register as teller of 1989's tallest tale in a story of a drought-stricken corn
farmer who gave new meaning to the phrase "knee-high by the Forth of July."

The newspaper deserved the top award for its report on an Iowa farmer who "was
doubly proud last summer when his corn was knee-high twice before the Fourth -
once on the way up, once on the way down", Hall officials said Thursday.

The hall of fame ceremony in Dannebrog was billed as the 65th annual awards
banquet, although sponsors admitted they might be lying.

Bill Orr, husband of Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, won the Mendacity Diplomacy Award
when he notified the hall officials he would be unable to attend next year's
dinner because "I have an important funeral to attend that day."

Last year, politicians were banned from the competition because the winners
must be amateurs, said Roger Welsch, the hall of fame's founder and director.

This central Nebraska town, population 356, welcomed celebrities in the black
shirts and white ties to the Dannebrog Convention Center, Welsch claimed.

"The gala day began with the first ever Formula One Grand Prix Race in the
streets of Dannebrog, with the favorites - Andretti, Unser, and Sullivan -
finishing first, second, and third," he said.

"Fred Andretti expressed his appreciation and said it was worth driving over
from Grand Island for the event, but he had expected something more than $5 off
a bearing pack over at Mel's Sinclair and a warm six-pack of Mountain Dew,"
Welsch said.

He said Gaylord Unser and Lumir Sullivan filed protests with race officials
because Andretti repeatedly rolled through stop signs in downtown Dannebrog.

Jim Knapp, a Kearney attorney, won the Karma Award for his naming of the three
things necessary to become a successful trial lawyer - "sincerity, sincerity,
sincerity." He said once you learn how to fake it, you can get away with almost
anything.

 [my brother tells this one]

I was sitting behind a car at a stop light the other day and I noticed
that it had a bumper sticker that read "Honk if you love Jesus".  So
I thought about it a bit and since I loved Jesus, I honked my horn.

I was very suprised when the driver of the car got out and yelled,
"The light is still red you asshole!!!!" got back in the car and drove
off through the light which had just turned green.

Subj:   Chinese Students Need Your Help

Congress has passed (by unanimous House vote and by voice vote in
 the Senate) a bill allowing Chinese students to stay in the United
  States even after their visas expire.  Thousands of these
   students have been outspoken in support of the democracy
    movement in their country, and can expect persecution if they
     return anytime soon.

George Bush plans to veto the bill so as not to strain relations
 with China.

You can call the White House to let the President know what you
 think of his intended veto.  It's a simple thing to do:  call the
  White House at 202/456-7639.  The bill in question is HR2712.

If the bill is vetoed, you can call your representatives in
 Congress at the Capital Hill Switchboard:  202/224-3121.

(Phone numbers are provided because this matter is urgent.  Letters
 won't arrive on time.)
