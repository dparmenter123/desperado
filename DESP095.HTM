Tom,

I haven't finished reading your first message on computers, but I have to
respond before I forget it and say to myself that it isn't that important.
I've heard the phrase 'happy horseshit' - in the US Army.  And I haven't
heard it since.

But to my excitement.  Just this very morning, while sitting on the hopper
trying to relieve myself and wake up, I read a very touching article in the
February Smithsonian about some crazy physical therapists who use the talking
computers to teach severely handicapped children to read, write, and speak.
They have had amazing results with children who have been accustomed to
sitting in corners and not speaking, not even making eye contact with
people.  They've sat the children in front of the talking computers and
flashed visual images on the screen.  The children learn to touch the keypad
that has the same image that's on the screen and the computer says the word.
The children have immediately started speaking the words.

The doctors doing the work were amazed at the results.  They wondered why.
The only answer they could come up with is that educators have been busy
teaching the 'exceptional' children what they have the hardest time doing
and telling children what they can't do.  And the children from the earliest
age have believed what the educators have been telling them.  One educator
was quoted as saying that a child would only attain the intelligence of
a 5 year old.  The implication was that this was pathetic.  And the doctor
commented that being a 5 year old was really wonderful.  Just think what
a 5 year can do, what energy and creativity is there.

After reading this article, I was near tears.  The Globe may indulge in
'happy horseshit', but I still believe in my favorite phrase about computers
( the title of a children's book) Computers Are for People.

              HOPEFULLY, TWO CONTRIBUTORS TRY TO LIMIT THE USE OF
              "HOPEFULLY" TO THE WAY IT IS  USED IN THIS HEADLINE

Here are two contributions on the "hopefully" controversy, followed by
the final word on the subject.

Subject: Hopefully this will help you to understand.

Tom,
        The use of "hopefully" as in the subject header above is considered
incorrect (by me at least) because it is an adverb which does not modify any
of the 'verbs, adverbs or other adverbs' in the sentence it which it is used.
The replacement of a phrase is not a grammatically recognized use of an adverb,
as in the use of "hopefully" to replace the phrase "I hope that".

From: ALIEN::REGINA::DCL
To:   ALIEN::PARMENTER
Subject: hopefully

The problem with "hopefully" is not with the word at all, of course,
just with the way it's very commonly used.  It's perfectly kosher when
the verb's action really does take place in a hopeful manner, as in
the Tom Swiftie

    "Is that portly comedian on TV tonight?", he asked hopefully.

The problem with the popular use of the word is that it doesn't make
sense grammatically.  It's an adverb, and as such modifies a verb,
telling when, where, or how the action described by the verb takes
place. In the sentence

    Hopefully the next Desperado will arrive soon

the only verb is the future tense "will arrive", so the adverb must modify it.
But the "arriving" itself won't take place in a manner that is "full of hope"
(it may, but that's not what the sentence is trying to say); the real intent is
to apply the adverb to the ENTIRE SENTENCE that follows. The English language
does not have any provision for distributing an adverb over an entire sentence;
adverbs must modify specific verbs.

It's been years since I studied (natural language) grammar formally, so the
above may not be 100% accurate.  But it's my understanding of the problem with
THAT WORD.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Apparently some Desperados think an adverb cannot modify a whole
sentence. Happily our good English adverbs are tougher than some
Desperados think they are. Probably most people in their everyday
speech and writing use adverbs in this way, including some of the most
improbable.  Obviously sentences are not damaged be being modified all
at once by one lone adverb.  Evidently the case against "hopefully" is
that it is a a *new* adverb on the list of those adverbs that can
modify whole sentences and not just one measly verb, and great big
grownup sentences, quite complex, though still diagrammable,
sentences, not that being diagrammable is all that big a deal
sentencewise.  Mercifully the newness of "hopefully" will not will not
last forever and the word can settle down to its apppointed task of
modifying whole sentences.  Presumably there will by then be some new
controversy alarming the planet.

Among the synonyms and superior substitutes for "hopefully" that have
been offered by the pundits are the pompous and wordy "it is to be
hoped" and the laughable "hopably" and the forlorn "hopingly".

Clearly I number myself among those who see nothing wrong with using
"hopefully" as the genius of the language dictates, and not as some
dry grammmar book decrees.  Hopefully this completes the discusion.

How to Recognize a Company Car -

        We found an entertaining article and, with permission of the National
Association of Fleet Administration, have reprinted it here for your enjoyment.

        Why are company cars so popular? The reason seems to be that they have
special features not found in private cars. We would like to cite these
examples.

1.  They travel faster in all gears, especially reverse.
2.  They accelerate at a phenomenal rate.
3.  They enjoy a much shorter braking distance.
4.  They have a much tighter turning radius.
5.  They can take 'bumps' at twice the speed of private cars.
6.  Oil and tire pressures, battery and water levels do not need to be checked
        nearly so often.
7.  The floor is shaped like an ashtray.
8.  They burn only gas with the highest trading stamp rate.
9.  They do not have to be geared at night.
10.  They can be driven up to 100 miles with the oil warning light flashing.
11.  They need cleaning less often, especially inside.
12.  The suspension is reinforced to allow concrete slabs and other heavy
        building materials to be carried.
13.  They are adapted to allow reverse to be engaged while the car is still
        moving forward.
14.  The tire walls are designed for bumping into and over cars.
15.  Unusual and alarming engine noises are easily eliminated by the adjust-
        ment of the radio volume control.
16.  No security is needed. They may be left anywhere - unlocked - with the
        keys in the ignition.

From: ORC::SEIFERT
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER
Subject: Desperado, Roll over, Beethoven!!

In 1952, the Buffalo Symphony orchestra was celebrating its tenth anniversary.
In an attempt to mount a celebration worthy of the occasion, they contracted
with the son of the great Serge Kousevitsky to conduct a gala concert to be
climaxed by a rousing rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

For those who are not familiar with the Ninth Symphony, it is a long piece
climaxed by a fourth movement that features a full chorus and four vocal
soloists. The theme to this movement is introduced early in the movement by
the double basses after which point the basses sit idle until the last few
bars of the piece.

This is some 30-35 minutes of idle time and, to add insult to injury, the
piece is played so frequently that it has become a cliche to most orchestral
musicians and bores them to death. Only their true professionalism sees them
through the piece.I

Well, it turns out that the Buffalo Symphony at the time was not the most
professional of orchestras, and the bass section in particular consisted of a
bunch of rowdies fresh from the docks. The basses were sitting around after
rehearsal one night, grumping about again being sentenced to sit through yet
another Beethoven's Ninth, when one of them suddenly hatched one heck of an
idea: since the basses sit at the back of the orchestra right next to the
curtain, they could leave without causing any disturbance. Why not play their
introductory theme to the last movement, then sneak out behind the curtain and
run across the street for a symbolic beer? They could finish a beer easy and
be back in plenty of time to play their parts of the last few chords in the
piece. A splendid idea indeed.

During rehearsal on the day of the big concert, word of the plan spread like
wildfire throughout the rest of the orchestra. The son of the great Kousevitsky
soon got wind of it, however, and called the bass section aside.

"What the heck are you guys trying to prove? This has got to be the tackiest
scheme I ever heard of! Haven't you guys got any sense of propriety at all?"

"Don't sweat it Kooz baby!" they replied, "We'll be very quiet and be back in
plenty of time for the big finish."

"What about all the noise you'll make shuffling through your scores looking
for the right spot when you get back?"  "Not to mention the distraction if
they fall off the music stand as you leave!"

"Piece of cake. Before leaving, we'll tie back our scores to the right place
with rubber bands. That will not only keep them from rustling or falling but
will also make sure we have the right place when we get back. Don't worry...
we won't let you down."

The son of the great Kousevitsky was not impressed, but there wasn't a whole
heck of a lot he could do about it. After all, he was only the SON of the
great Kousevitsky and besides, he basically didn't give a rat's hat. He
shrugged his shoulders at the smirking basses and left.

Well, the great night came and the concert went splendidly (as splendid as the
Buffalo Symphony could do at the time, anyway) all the way up to the last
movement of Beethoven's Ninth. The movement started, the basses played their
introductory theme and then, grinning broadly at each other, tied their scores
back to the final chords. Then, ever so slickly, they slipped behind the
curtain noiselessly, and out the stage door they went. Across the street
they sprinted, and once in the bar, ordered a round of triple martinis to
celebrate their cleverness.

They belted down their drinks and, noticing that only a few of their 30-or-so
minutes had passed, quickly ordered another round, then another. You guessed
it. They drank so heavily so quickly that they were totally snockered in
15 minutes and lost all sense of time.

Meanwhile, back in the concert hall, Beethoven's Ninth was fast reaching its
conclusion. The final chords approached and the son of the great Kousevitsky
turned to the bass section to cue them, only to find their seats vacant.

He was outraged. Imagine his humiliation and frustration. Here it was the
bottom of the Ninth, the scores were tied, and the basses were loaded!
