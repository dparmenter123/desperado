                           Quote of the Week

    Ken Olsen, president of Digital Equipment Corp., asked during a
    Q&amp;A session after his plenary address at Autofact about any
    security problems with DEC's in-house communications network
    which he had earlier told the audience allows some 128,000
    employees worldwide to exchange notes, responded: "It tolerates
    some impertinent comments - mostly about me," drawing a roar
    from his standing room only listeners.

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.  This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

Dear Tom,

Considering that the Bush/Quayle victory was due in large part to the
ineptitude and quality of the Democratic opposition I feel that it is
appropriate to dust off and emend my 1972 bumper stick to:

Thank you,

Subj:   drag them through the streets and kick them to death

I too have sympathy for the beleagered smokers. If it weren't so unhealthy, I
would begin to smoke myself, in solidarity with their persecuted lot, because
anything that is so antisocial can't be all bad.

And I have a deep suspicion for all these people that are 'allergic' to smoke
all of a sudden. Damned sissies and liars, as far as I'm concerned.

When I was a kid uncle Walter who smoked big fat stogies used to come up from
Dorchester every Saturday to play cards and drink. He'd bring me packs of
Beemans, Clove, and Blackjack gum. A while back I noticed the reappearance of
all three, and bought a pack each. Or tried to. Only had a buck, and instead
of a nickel, they cost an un-nostalgic 45 cents a pack. Had to put the
Blackjack back, Jack. You can't go home again, not even to old gum. For 45
cents, the Beeman's and Clove tasted lousy. Maybe they always did outside the
environment of ceegar smoke, beer and uncles. Or maybe I'm allergic to gum
these days. Yes, that's it - I'm ALLERGIC to gum!

Keep those dirty gum-chewers away from my cube. In fact, I vote we drag them
through the streets and kick them to death. Nah, that's too good for them. If
they want to engage in their filthy chaw, make them stand around in hallways
and corners like the stinking rotten lowlife they are.

Subj:   Xerox never does anything original...

(Reprinted from Harvard Lampoon's parody of USA Today; )

   Xerox officials held an emergency press conference Wedensday to
announce a total recall of all Reprotron 5000 Three-Dimensional Copy
Machines.
   Xerox stock has plummeted to a new all-time low since the release of
the innovative device.  Xerox hailed the Reprotron 5000 as a "new
revolution in copying" when it introduced the machine just two weeks
ago, and market insiders were certain that the copier would send Xerox
stock through the roof.
   At a demonstration of the Reprotron in August, Xerox staffers made
full three-dimensional copies of an Oriental vase, a bowl of fruit, and
a perfect red rose.  Reporters were invited to sample apples and oranges
copied from the original fruit, though Xerox technicians did warn that
the copied fruit might taste slightly of toner.  John Thompson (inventor
of the Reprotron) stepped forward to make a copy of a Manhattan phone
book, but accidentally copied his hand and forearm.  He quickly disposed
of the highly detailed, frantically wiggling half-limb as it slid out of
the copier's delivery slot.
   But Xerox wasn't ready for what happened next.  "We assumed that
people would behave as responsible, thinking human beings with this
copier, and obviously we were wrong," Thompson states.  From all across
the USA, reports have been filing in of the copier being used in what
Thompson calls "sick, greedy ways."
   At a Copy Center in Austin, Texas, a couple was arrested for making
15 copies of their three-year-old son, Jeremy, and then refusing to pay
for the copies, claiming that some of the new children were "smudged."
Local authorities were uncertain as to which charges should be pressed.
   In Union City, Arizona, Treasury Department officials are
investigating reports of a secretary who allegedly copied a single bar
of gold bullion 150 times.  A task force investigator stated, "Granted,
it takes money to make money, but we're almost certain that this action
is in violation of some laws."
   Xerox officials are also under fire from consumers, due to rumors
that the three-dimensional copying technology is imperfect.  Harold Butz
of Peoria, Pennsylvania, made a copy of a common cement brick
spray-painted gold.  Butz claims he was "shocked and dismayed" when he
discovered that the machine-made copy was 22-karat solid gold.  "All I
wanted was a really good copy of a cement brick spray-painted gold'"
Butz stated.  "What the hell am I going to do with this thing?"
   Xerox plans to scrap all the machines they are able to recall, but
Thompson expressed concern over the so-called "black market Reprotrons."
   "Apparently some sick and greedy people discovered that if they had
two machines, they could use one to make a working copy of the other,"
Thompson revealed.  "To tell the truth, we only sold two machines in all
- - to the Cappelli family, a New Jersey based Meat packing firm.  These
copy pirates should be aware that as with anything that is copied from a
copy and so on, there are bound to be defects in the copies produced.
We have no idea what kind of stuff will pop out of the slot when a
person copies something on a fourth- or fifth-generation machine."
Thompson declined to comment on reports that hundreds of the pirated
machines have a human thumb attached to the coin slot which constantly
wiggles - the result of a person's thumb getting in the way during one
of the original copier-to-copier copies.
   "Ultimately, we're not too worried," Thompson stated.  "People owning
the copiers will eventually run out of the fluid that make the machine
work, and we've taken all the fluid off the market.  A machine can only
last two weeks or so without a fluid refill, and there won't be any
fluid refills."  When asked why people with copiers couldn't simply make
copies of the fluid cannisters they already have, Xerox officials
hastily ended the press conference, stating that they "need to
reconsider a few things."
