The Culture of Technology
by Arnold Pacey, MIT Press, 1983.

Perhaps the most thought provoking, troubling,  comforting, illuminating
book I have read in a long time: It is going to have its influence on
the rest of my professional life. This book presents a cogent view of
technology as a very HUMAN processes.

Pacey starts off by calling attention to the fact that the traditional view
of technology - a deterministic process that is valueless, unstoppable,
truly rational, and based solely on the techniker's trained judgement -
is rather naive. Technology is a result of many things: a manic desire
for virtuosity, national pride (the moon shot), fear (the arms race),
as a means of artistic expression, as a means of social service, etc, etc.
As such many different values go into the making of technology. It has,
however, traditionally been very "MALE"  throughout history; it enshrines
male values, and a male perspective.

Pacey then explores important attitudes and experiences of
techno-person in the modern world - what is progress?  How adequate
are our resources?  Who is an expert and how does he/she think?  What
is creativity?  Several illuminating quotations, anecdotes, field
studies, statistics are presented. He makes a comparison between Sri
Lanka and Kerala (a province in South India). both of which have
achieved  drastic reductions in infant mortality, and similar
improvements in nutrition, by way of completely different approaches.
Very inspiring.

In one chapter, Pacey presents an exciting view of women and their
potential impact on technology. Women's contributions to social
well-being have always been denigrated; Women's attitudes towards
technology, have therefore had little impact. Pacey presents an
exciting vista of the potential contributions that women technologists
(with their "traditional" bias away from individualistic virtuosity,
aggressive competetiveness and more  towards people/community
oriented,  organic, nurturing, user-driven, humanistic technology)
can make to future generations. Very inspiring view indeed, but I
don't see the practice of technology NOW changing as a result of
talented women coming in; The institutions we work have too much
inertia for the built-in male values to yield. What seems to happen is
that many women adopt the institutional norms (become
white-male-ized), some give up on making a difference, etc etc. I have
seen strong women who really change bad things (macho displays,
sexism, aggressive competition etc) but NOT ENOUGH. Its time they got
paid more attention.  And that responsiblity, says Pacey, is in the
hands of those holding the reins. The lessons are hard to learn, and
may determine our survival as a race.

Pacey criticizes the narrow minded, bureaucratic, undemocratic
practice of technology by such institutions as the Atomic Energy
Commission (in the UK), multinationals,  (with their unrelenting
pursuit of profit), and the military industrial complex. These
institutions have shifted the political balance away from the
democratic process, and have fostered a linear, myopic practice of
technology, carefully cultivating an atmosphere of secrecy and
misinformation, and making decisions away from public scrutiny.

He restresses the fact that technology is a human  process, and that
there no right or wrong answers in most situations. He sees technology
as functioning best as a &lt;&lt;dialectic process between entirely
different view points&gt;&gt;. In this  context, he emphasizes the need for
public interest research groups, better dissemination of technical
knowledge etc. This promotes a wider awareness, and therefore more
informed, creative dialogue.  He cites as a shining example of this
kind of dialogue a study conducted by Justice Thomas Berger on the
feasibility of an Oil Pipeline from the north in Canada. Berger
described the wider (ecological, social political) implications of the
pipeline, and carefully exposed the different value systems (economic,
frontier-adventure spirit, technical excellence) and how they
interacted in the progress of this project.

This is a radically different view of technology from what is taught
in Engineering schools; I for one, was taught to design my circuits by
very clear, well defined criteria: reduce components, reduce
dissipation, reduce delay times, keep duty cycles within power ratings
etc etc. No body told me about designing my power amplifiers so that a
barefoot mechanic in a hut near Chidambaram could fix them with
nothing more than a soldering iron. The vast majority of Indians live
in villages that are barely electrified (by western standards). Yet,
the only values I learned as an engineering student were those of
technical virtuosity, up-to-dateness, etc. Why?  Didn't know any
better. No dialogue, no learning.

Pacey raises many thought provoking questions for all of us poor
nerds. Why are we doing what we are doing?  Would a speech pathologist
or a cowherd in Punjab see what we are doing as valuable to him/her?
How much are the values and merit rating system of our technical labs
influenced by empty macho values?  What is good engineering?  How can
we best infuse the views of women and third worlders (such as me) into
technical life?  How do we ensure that  technology progresses in a
direction that is democratically chosen?  Should there be an
engineer's "Hippocratic oath"?  [pacey] How do we pay off our debt to
society?  How do we balance between "technically sweet" and "useful"
solutions?

You tell me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Well, to begin with, I don't see that technology 'throughout history'
has been strictly a male process.  Technology is using tools and the
human race uses more tools than any other animal.  Men, women and
children use tools and understand their use, and they understand tools
better than the otter that puts an oyster between two rocks to break
it or the ape that uses a stick to dig grups out from bark.  Step back
10,000 years, to the dawn of history.  Did male creatures invent
knives, needles, spoons, spears, weaving, pants, mirrors, hammers,
pokers, tongs, rope braiding, fences, wheels, tubs, traps, benches,
saddles, bridles, mortars, pestles, cornmeal, paint, paintbrushes,
walls, roofs, floors, staircases, roads, streets, alleys, mascara and
the multiple myriads of tools that were invented before anybody wrote
anything down while the female creatures just sat around?  I doubt it.

The purpose of tools is to make things easier and I don't doubt that
women are as efficient as men.  True, the industrial age has been
dominated by men and narrow technical solutions, but the word 'narrow'
makes us aware that there are also broad technical solutions.  If a
tool doesn't make things easier, it's not much of a tool.

An excerpt from Elizabeth Drew's article in the October 8 NEW YORKER

"Reagan's ads come off like commercial commercials--soothing, pleasant, Miller
time.  They fit right in with what people who watch television are accustomed
to seeing.   Mondale's ads, by contrast, come off as political, didactic, and
jarring--because they are intended to jar, to raise questions about nuclear
war, the deficit, and so on.  But they are no fun to watch.  Moreover, it is
not just the fact that Reagan himself is better on television than is Mondale,
but that Reagan is projecting many of television's prime-time values:
toughness, heroism, the simple resolution of problems--and is thus reinforced
by, and compatible with, the dominant culture.  A friend of mine who is a
close student of television says that he thinks that perhaps the only person
who could defeat Ronald Reagan is Clint Eastwood."

Here it is -- the most perfect illustration yet of a point you made
a few years ago.

From SF-LOVERS:

Yes, Frank Herbert is involved in the Dune movie, and yes, he is
happy about it.  But I'm not happy about the other Dune books he's
done (say, the last three), and I'm not particularly happy about
many of the other books he's done, so I don't find his happiness to
be that comforting.

So Herbert, the creator of the Dune books, is not to be trusted with
guardianship of the screenplay;  this fan, like countless others, knows
better.

                     W. EDWARDS DEMING,

        the man who taught Japan about quality, believes:

                        YES, WE CAN !!

        W. EDWARDS DEMING, 83 years old and crusty, little time to waste
on politesse, hard of hearing now, the man who more than anyone else taught
the Japanese about quality, has come to Detroit this day in high style.  It
is a city which long scorned him.  That was when it was rich and mighty, and
limitlessly confident of its power and vision.  Now its back is to the wall,
and it will listen.  The Society of Automotive Engineers is holding its
annual convention here, and it has asked Deming to speak.  He assents, the
prophet finally honored in his own country.

        Still, Edwards Deming is not in an altogether jolly mood.  The
morning's copy of the Detroit Free Press quotes Bill Brock, the U.S. Trade
Representative as saying that the automakers have done just about everything
they can to compete with the Japanese.  Brock has said this to Congress in
asking the Congressmen to reduce budget deficits, but this does not
mollify Deming.  It encourages him.  He believes in his heart that the sins of
American industry are of its own making, that the Japanese challenge may offer
American business the last chance to save itself--- by waking it up.

        Often his speeches are rich, semi-theatrical critiques of American
Industry.  He chides, he skewers, he assaults.  Few are spared, certainly not
most American chief executives, certainly not the nation's business schools or
its banks.  Nothing gets sharper criticism than the management class in
America.  "The one thing we must never export," he says, "is American
management-at least to friendly countries."  On this day, he talks with
contempt about the head of a company in California who had called, wanting his
service.  Come for only one day, the company manager had pleaded, and as they
talked Deming had decided that the man was not serious about product, that all
he wanted was some quickie fix.  "Instant quality," Deming said with disgust.
"When I told him I could not spare a day, the man asked me to come for half a
day."

        His contempt while telling the story is palpable.  What he has to teach
took 50 years to learn, and he cannot do it in one day or half a day.  As such,
the main forum for him has been the four-day seminar, and he gives about 30 of
these a year.  The one time he seems to explode on this day is when someone
asks whether America can meet the Japanese challenge.  Of course it can, he
answers angrily, and continues.  What is left unsaid is that, to do this,
American industry had better pay more attention to manufacturing and product.
It had better pay more attention to its customers instead of its bonuses.

        He is both crusader and curmudgeon, prophet and architect of the new
economic order in which American goods must compete with those from countries
where manufacturing is held in higher esteem.  There are colleagues who
consider him the most important man in American industry at this moment, and a
number of them, both in Japan and the United States, have nominated him for the
Nobel Prize.  William Conway, the former head of the Nashua Corporation, a
company he helped save, refers to him as the father of the third wave of the
industrial revolution.  The first wave was the coming of the factory based on
machinery, the revolution wrought by Eli Whitney.  The second was the mass
production wave, which started with Henry Ford.  The third is the revolution of
Edwards Deming, using statistical controls to improve quality.

        He is passionate and on occasion intemperate but also wonderfully
gentle with anyone he believes is making a genuine effort.  He has little time
to waste in what he believes are the false amenities of the world.  Knowing
that his seminars are filled with high-level managers, he often delights in
chiding them and telling how they have become strangers on their own factory
floors.

        In the past, some of his associates worried about the way he jumped on
people whose questions irritated him.  They warned him that he had to change,
that there was no such thing as a stupid question.  "Want to bet?" he replied.
He thinks time is running out, not so much on him but on America if it does not
change its ways.

        His dicipline is statistics, and what he offers companies in the most
narrow sense is called statistical quality control, that is, a means of
improving quality by statistical methods.  In simplest definition, it is the
use of statistical controls to find out the messages that your machines and
products are sending out.  It can monitor fluctuation and, done regularly,
intelligently and at close intervals, can give manufacturers far greater
control over their assembly lines.  It can tell you whether you are buying from
the right supplier and whether the products coming down your line are reaching
a maximum level of quality.

        But to think of him as only a statistician is a mistake.  In any true
sense, he is suggesting to American companies that they rethink who they are,
what they are doing and why they are doing it.  He is particularly critical of
the modern phenomenon of the executive who comes right out of a top business
school, with expertese in finance but none in the product end, and who becomes
an all-purpose interchangeable manager, able to go from a sausage factory one
day to a newspaper company on the next and an industrial company on the third.

        "What is the motivation of men like this?" he asks.  "Do they even know
what they do anymore?"  Are they in business just for maximum profit in the
shortest possible span, or are they there to make a product and to make it with
true excellence and to create in the process a harmonious workplace?  "These
men," he says with great contempt, "are the masters of all the visible numbers,
but they know nothing of the invisible numbers.  Who can put a price on a
satisfied customer and who can figure out the cost of a dissatisfied customer?"

        What is the purpose of life and what is the purpose of work? he seems
to be asking.  In that sense, says Ron Moen, a Deming diciple who works for the
Pontiac program at GM, he sees work as a kind of Zen experience, and it is the
reason Moen believes that Deming has been so successful in Japan.  There, his
own value system transfers readily.

        He is listened to now in America for one reason alone, and that is the
success he is credited with in Japan.  The Japanese are his prize students, and
he is their great teacher, a man they revere.  Just about the greatest honor to
befall any industrialist in Japan is to win the Deming Prize.  But that success
came because when he first started teaching the Japanese, in the immediate
post-war years, their backs were completely to the wall.  He was a
statistician, a disciple of a man named Walter Shewhart, who had been a pioneer
in using statistical methods to gain quality control.  Some of Shewhart's
teachings were put in use during World War II in the Pentagon, but in the
immense affluence of the post-war years.  American management, its markets
seemingly guaranteed, turned away from quality and concentrated its efforts on
a variety of short-range goals.  The importance of quality diminished in
industrial companies; indeed, the power of the manufacturing people diminished
within the same companies.  Manufacturing was taken for granted.  There was no
real competition in heavy industry, or at least no international competition.

        In the words of Hal Sperlich, a brilliant former Ford man now at
Chrysler, "We thought we were competitive, and we were, in a limited, protected
way.  But we were like club tennis players, had a terrific game going every
weekend.  And then when we ran into the Japanese, it was as if Bjorn Borg and
Jimmy Connors walked on the court."  In American industry in those days, a
power went to men who could use numbers and who were in the financial systems,
and men from marketing, who could help carve up the rich, ever-expanding
middle-class market that was opening up in front of them.  Manufacturing became
a backwater, and quality suffered with it.  America was living the arrogrance
of affluence.  The trouble, Deming decided, was that he had lit a lot of fires
but they had all been on the factory floor and not at management level.

        So it was that in 1950, on his third trip to Japan, when he was asked
to give a series of lectures on quality control to Japanese engineers, he was
determined that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated in Japan.  He
insisted that he would not meet with them unless he met with the heads of their
companies as well----quality had to be a companywide issue.

        "Otherwise," he said, "you will go on like the Americans and
make the same mistakes as they are making."

        The Japanese were desperate at the time.  They had been ravaged by the
war, they were poor in natural resources, and the reputation of their products
was terrible.  Deming expected little response from his request, but it turned
into a command performance.  The head of a Japanese business organization sent
out telegrams to 45 industrialists.  All 45 showed up.  Deming was launched in
Japan.  In order to keep their hopes up, he told them that if they listened
to him, they would be able to compete with the West in five years and that the
West would soon demand protection from them.  One Japanese executive wrote in
his diary at the time:  "Here was this tall, strange American telling us that
we would be an important force in five years if we listened to him.  We really
didn't believe him, but in order not to lose face we did what he told us, and
it worked."  Shortly afterward, a wire company reported a 30 percent increase
in productivity.  Within months, other companies were reporting comparable
improvements.  For Deming, those early lectures were remarkable.  The Japanese
were desperate to hear every word he had to say, to understand every secret.
Everything he said was taken down, passed along.  He was not so much being
deified as codified.

        He became a guru to them, more than just a technical adviser, more of a
spiritual one.  The Deming Prize was endowed in 1951 to reward the Japanese
companies sustaining the highest level of quality.

        This famous American believed in them more than they believed in
themselves at the start.  Crusty and caustic he might be with fellow Americans,
but he was sensitive and gentle with them.  He constantly reassured them about
the inevitability of their success.  When Japanese productivity teams visited
America, the one person they always wanted to see was Edwards Deming, and for
them it was a kind of pilgrimage.

        What impressed them most about Deming was his modesty.  He was
passionate about making products better, but he was not interesed in money, and
he seemed to have only a marginal interest in material things.  The Japanese
were impressed that someone who was to them so famous lived so simply, his
office in his own house, his wife working for him.  This, they decided, was the
old-fashioned American Puritan ethic that they read so much about in history
books.He was not some highly paid expert who dealt with them first and foremost
to make money.  He was different from most American industrialists that the
Japanese teams visited.  Americans were always lecturing the Japanese, and the
lectures were in part a means of showing that the Americans were richer and
more powerful than the Japanese.  Deming, more than any other American, seem to
listen.  He seemed oddly apologetic about the fact that no one in his own
country paid very much attention to his teachings.  The Japanese thought that
was very puzzling.

        His word received very little notice in America, until the industrial
crisis deepened in 1979 and for the first time Americans began taking stock of
their industrial core.  In June 1980, NBC did a documentary which contrasted
Japanese quality with American quality.  If anyone was the star of the show, it
was Deming.  It did not, predictably, get high ratings, but it remains, says
one NBC official, the most requested transcript for a documentary that NBC has.
It also established Deming as the major authority on the subject of quality in
the world, a man who taught the Japanese and might yet teach the Americans.
With that, the phone began to ring.  Soon he was in demand everywhere and
signed contracts with two of the big three auto companies, Ford and General
Motors.

        These projects, about three years in progress, are critical to him.
"We in America will have to be more protectionist or more competitive," he
says, "The choice is very simple.  If we are to become more competitive, then
we have to begin with our quality."  That process, he believes, must begin in
Detroit.  So far the results, albeit early, have been relatively positive.
There seems to be support at the very top in both Ford and Pontiac.  The
workers like Deming, in no small part because he listens to them, pays
attention to their grievances, and because he has often stated that poor
quality is 85 percent a management problem and 15 percent a worker problem.

        At Ford, executives are working on varying means to release their
colleagues from short-range attitudes and give them more room for long-range
planning.  Because past meetings were often dominated by managers who came in
laden with reams of paper, one of the experiments being tried limits each man
in the meeting to one sheet of paper.  An in-house movie candidly documents the
difference between a transmission part made in Japan and in the U.S.  The Ford
manager notes that while the American part is good, the Japanese part is damn
good.  That kind of candor is new.  In the past, one of the problems with a
place like Ford was that the answers tended to be molded to the needs of the
questioners.

        But the problems are immense.  It is already late in the competition,
and there are those who think that the Japanese are improving at a faster rate
than we are.  More, companies like Ford and GM, for all of their good
intentions, have deeply ingrained cultures that are essentially the antithesis
of what Deming teaches.  They have rewarded (handsomely, with huge bonuses)
those who have maximized production and minimized costs.  They have rarely
rewarded efforts to improve quality.

        Deming takes his experiments with Detroit seriously.  Though every
workday for the next two years already is scheduled, and though he fends off
almost all additional requests, these two programs retain high priority.
Detroit is at the core, not just itself but also in its ability to influence
subsidiary companies.

        In many ways, say his friends, it is the most important thing he has
ever undertaken in this country.  If the quality programs succeed, everyone
will be the beneficiary.  If they fail, he warns, it will not be long before
Americans will not be able to sell anything.  That urgency, his friends add, is
why he is so crusty and sometimes even rude.  He is obsessed with the challenge
from Asia and the lack of American response.  He believes there is very little
time.  He must be listened to.  This is not because his ego is large, though he
is not without a considerable sense of his own importance.  Rather it is
because the alternative is so bleak.  He hates the stupidity and waste that
result when things are done poorly, of customers dissatisfied, their money
squandered, of the jobs lost, and they companies which may be closed.  His ego
lies in the fact that he believes if people will listen to him, it need not
happen.

Thanks Dave. But the apl function doesn't meet my requirments.
It is a solution. Just as the following command file is:
        $ create foo.com
        type foo.com
        ^Z

But it does not qualify because it must reference the file by name to work.
just as the apl function must know it's name. In cases such as this renaming
the function, program, or file makes the code incorrect. A valid solution
is one in which the code can change names and still be correct.

Subj:   Of Chili's, Powders and Curry

What's all this in Desperado about Chili "POWDER"!!! Shame on you purists!

I was converted to using original ingredients many years ago at U.M.I.S.T.
(that's the English equivalent of MIT) by a Hindu exchange student who
made the most devine curries imaginable - pause for mouth to water in fond
remembrance. Until I met this veritable maharishi of the cullinary art, I
too dwelled in the wilderness of Spar Instant Curry mix, or even Tesco's
own Madras Curry Powder. No more - the instruction received in those far
off days on the use of exotic spicea with unpronouncable names (they do
however understand in the local Asian shops) was never to be forgotten
and the pleasure in creating YOUR OWN blends far outweigh any cost or
time disadventages.

However, to return to chili's. Powder's are what old spinsters take to
relieve the ague (look it up!) - chili pods are for chili's. The means of
preparation varies, but they should NEVER be dried and powdered - the loss
of flavour cannot be forgiven - the delicate oils from fresh fruits can only
be appreciated by the true chili eater. Try using a pod or three in future -
cook in your usual manner, but put in the pods instead of the powder, and
allow at least 3 hours cooking time in a WELL-SEALED pot over a VERY LOW
HEAT.

Appreciate it!

An Indian (Kashmiri) friend of mine in college was invited to a
Hoosier home for Thanksgiving.  In his honor, they served curry, which
they had apparently never made before.  In his words:

        "She brought this gray soupy stuff out to the table and then the
         lady ran from the room.  She came back with a little can and
         said: 'Oh!  I forgot the curry powder!'  and shook the can of
         yellow powder all over the gray soup."

Tom,
        Since Mike Duggan once haunted Colorado Springs, I can attest to the
greatness of his chile.  It is a little known fact the the main reason Mike
left here for New Mexico is the fact that he entered his chile in a local
cook-off and they told him to use tomatoes.  Two things belong with chile
but not in it, and they are tomatoes and beans.  Outside of the southwest, I
have seen few people who appreciate good green and red chile.  Most people
around here think that spicy spagetti sauce with hamburger is chile.

P.S. One addition that will improve most beef based chiles is adding about a
cup of beef bullion to each gallon of chile prior to the 4 hour min. cookdown.

P.P.S. Another use for green chile is the morning after, its great on omelettes
or scrambled eggs.

                                Hot on the trail of the better chile pod,

Boy, it's fun to be back doing these things regularly.  I am actively
