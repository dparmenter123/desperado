The original question: What to do about rodent roommates in my Somerville
apartment?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: DOSADI::BINDER
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER

My experience in evicting roommates of the rodent persuasion is that they
really do fall for the classic ham-in-the-moustrap gambit.  Cheese ain't
all it's cracked up to be, despite the common epithet "rat cheese", applied
to cheddar.  If the undesirable cohabitant is named Rattus Rattus or Rattus
Norvegicus, I suspect that a somewhat larger capture device would serve.
In any case, though, my experiences were uniformly disgusting and messy -
but my erstwhile companions never bothered me again.

in the house, and barbara is afraid of mice...as well as dust balls,
moving feet, and sunlight.  but i'm sure they could intimidate your

        This is to the person who found a small rodent sharing living
acommadations with them. When I lived in San Antonio, I found myself in
a similiar circumstances. I solved the problem thusly. I placed pieces
of Polish sausage around the kitchen (like under the sink, and in a few
of the cupboards that I knew it liked to visit). In the middle of the
floor, I then placed the biggest rat trap I could find and baited it
with two Maalox tablits. The mouse gorged itself on the sausage and
the rest is history.

        If you're interested, I could recount my tales of giant roach
hunting, and great roach recipes (I only kill what I can eat).

Regarding the killing of rodents:

The best way is to use a mousetrap.  No one ever built a better
mousetrap than the classic, cheap, spring-loaded wooden ones.  They
are effective, and they are disposable, which is important.  I think
they come in sizes, in case you have a rat instead of a mouse.

Don't hire an exterminator to come in and spray poison gas in your
apartment.  Also, don't leave little tins of poison in the cupboards.
If mice get poisoned, they hide in your wallboards and then die.
Then they decompose, and they stink.

A recent DESPERADO sought assistance on ways to serve an eviction
notice to unwanted (undemocratic) rodents that don't share the rent.

I had a similar problem - perhaps the following will help:

My ecological friends said to try one of these gentle traps that look
like swiss cheese with some sticky tape inside an otherwise empty
wedge-shaped box. Put a dab of peanut butter in it and the roommate is
supposed to go for it, but get his feet stuck in the goo. You can then
carry him (live) somewhere and do something to free him.

I found no rodent dumb enough to think a cardboard box looked like
cheese - especially since it smelt of peanut butter.

So I tried stronger medicine - D-CON. Well, my friends (I had more than
one) LOVED IT! In fact they kept coming back for more. I'd be there in
the den, watching the evening news and one by one they'd come in and
feast on the box of CON - night after night!

That got expensive so I abandoned that method.

So I resorted to the old, reliable u-snap-it trap. Plunk a dab of
peanut butter (it doesn't dry out like cheese) on the trigger and set
it in a corner traversed by said guests. Nothing happened for a while
till I noticed one night the peanut butter was gone and the trap was
still set.

Being warm, the ants got to &amp; ate the whole thing.

Eventually though, I prevailed. There were more ants than mice. I knew
I had them all after I put out the trap and twice in a row the ants
got to it first.

It's been quiet ever since.

Regarding rats and mice, I live in Cambridge and we get our share,
most frequently in the Spring and Fall.  I can't see we have all
the answers, but here's how we deal with mice:

1.  ALL food is protected.  We've got lots of jars and canisters.
It's actually not a bad way to live.
2.  We use Victor traps.  Accept no substitutes.  It takes a bit
of practice to set a Victor trap - they're very sensitive - but
they work well.  Bait the traps with peanut butter or cheddar
cheese.  Stuff the bait into the bait holder so the mouse can't
just lick the food off of it.
3. Put the traps in dark covered places where the mouse or mice
are likely to feel secure.  They won't look for food out in the
open unless they're desperado.  They love being under the sink
and under and in the stove.  We put traps under, not in, the
stove, for obvious reasons.
4.  Mice usually won't go for a new source of food until they've
seen it for 2 or 3 days, so be patient.
5.  Mouse poison, like D-Con, seems to be just good wholesome
food to Cambridge mice.  I don't recommend it unless you plan to
domesticate the darlings.
6.  You might try a high frequency generator to keep mice away.
I bought a few, and I think they work, but this Fall will be the
test.  You can get them at Masse's Hardware in Cambridge, but
they are expensive ($45 each, I think).
Good luck!

                            TESLA RECOIL

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: HYDRA::NUEBLING     "Ron Nuebling"
To:   PARMENTER

        The Nikola Tesla Museum is in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. "not exactly
a noted social venue, is it ??" ; to quote the Hitchiker. The socialist
republics have never missed an opportunity to glorify one of their own.
All his work was done in the U.S., but here he was condemned, vilified,
and forgotten.

        The credit for this injustice belongs to Thomas Edison and George
Westinghouse; with plenty left over for the - then - unquestioning public
and press. Edison built the first power station in New York City for
operating his electric lights in streets and houses. This was the famous
Pearl Street station. The power was generated and distributed as D.C.
Direct Current has the disadvantage that at moderate voltages the resistance
of the wires prevents it from being distributed over long distances. Further,
it cannot readily be 'transformed', i.e.; stepped up or down in voltage.

         Along came Tesla with not a mere invention, but an entire system.
Alternators to generate A.C., transformers to step the voltage up and down
before and after transmission (and with very little loss), and new motors
(induction) that would run on this new form of electrical power. Motors that
were quiet, powerful, and needed little maintenance because they had no
brushes !!

         Edison was riding the crest of an immense wave of popularity from
his previous inventions. The public thought he he could do no wrong. And
here came this eccectric, impoverished immigrant who threatened to diminish
Edison's reputation by proving his system inferior. A man that Edison had
dismissed for being insubordinate. It was intolerable. So the great man
stooped to lies and slander. He began a campaign to discredit Tesla personally
and professionally. He lied about the capabilities of the new system, when
he knew his company had failed in every attempt to send D.C. over long
distances. He said his lights would not work properly, or reliably on A.C.

He made vicious personal attacks on Tesla; attacks that were totally unjustified
and uncalled for. Edison even went so far as to take dogs from the city pound
and publically electrocute them with A.C. to show how dangerous this new
power was. The press and public ate it up.

             This was the age of the industrial 'robber barons'. The public
was used to being led around by the nose. One man saw the potential of Tesla's
work. A man who had himself changed the order of things with an invention;
and who had become wealthy by so doing. George Westinghouse had invented the
first effective, reliable, and fail-safe brake for trains: the air-brake. Up
until this invention, train wrecks from brake failure were common.

             Westinghouse approached Tesla, and made him a proposition. With
no one else interested, and Tesla's lack of greed and business acumen,
Westinghouse got an exclusive license to Tesla's system for a modest cash
payment and future royalties. Later he falsely claimed business difficulties,
and got Nikola to sign over the complete patent rights so he wouldn't have
to pay the royalties. Thus was born Westinghouse Electric; a sordid story
if ever there was.

             Denied recognition or reward for his achievements, Tesla turned
his faculties to other areas: radio-control, and high-frequency transmission
of power. This is the work for which he is most known. He retired to Colorado
Springs, and with the money remaining from Westinghouse, built a large
laboratory for conducting his energy transmission experiments. He succeeded
to an extent that baffles modern engineers. Some of his experiments have never
been duplicated. I have a picture in my office of him sitting between four
of his huge coils taking notes, while overhead is a huge ball of lightning,
with bolts 12-15 feet long striking out around the room. It is an awesome
sight. This happened in 1893 !!

For what it's worth, I won my junior high school science fair by
building one.  Used the cardboard tube some linoleum came in for the
core, the high-voltage section of a broken tv for the first stage of
voltage amplification (I later replaced this with a neon sign transformer),
and half a storm window for the capacitor that the tv set's high-voltage
section charged.  It produced a 6 or 7 inch spark, lit flourescent
bulbs fifteen feet away, and electricuted half the inhabitants of a small
ant farm I'd been keeping at the time.

There are others of us around who've built Tesla coils, too.  I know at
least one.

Tesla eventually went insane, either from organic causes, or a broken
spirit, or both.

Tesla was Croatian.  Atanasoff, inventor of the computer, is a
Bulgarian, and has been honored by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

I hate to clog up the airwaves with special bulletins, but it's better
that everyone gets the word at the same time.

I've accepted a position on the Technical Staff of Symbolics, Inc. of
Cambridge, effective next month.  My last day with DEC will be Friday,
September 9.

Symbolics is probably known to some of you as the maker of the Lisp Machine
and the 3600 Workstation.  (I have a couple of pages' worth of further
information, if anyone is interested.)  I'm joining the company as their
first editor, and will work on the complete revamping of their documentation
set.

Digital (specifically the wonderful Lorrie Doyle, my guardian angel, and
the thoroughly estimable Kathy Butler) picked me out of the job gutter
(almost literally;  as Lana Turner was discovered at Schwab's, so was I
discovered while tidying Ms. Doyle's bathroom), cleaned me up, and gave me
a job.  I've been with the company for over three mostly enjoyable (and rarely
routine) years;  it's not easy to leave my friends and the memories behind.
But my new position at Symbolics is an opportunity for significant personal
and career growth that I can't pass up.

I've been lucky enough to work with two exceptionally talented groups of
people in Engineering (where my heart e'er dwells) and Ed. Services.  You
will not be forgotten.

Excerpts from "Ham in Space" QST September 1983

          "At periods of time during the nine-day
           flight of STS-9 (rescheduled for launch on
           October 28), radio amateurs will have a
           chance to make a two-way contact with
           Owen Garriott, W5LFL.  During the odd
           minutes of this time period, Owen will
           scan the earth-to-space frequencies and
           log those call signs he identifies.  During
           the even minutes, he will transmit on
           145.550 MHz (the primary space-to-earth
           frequency, with backups available) and
           read back those call signs he has entered
           in his log."

For those interested in the Shuttle Program, you can monitor the
space-to-earth communications using a good Police Scanner tuned
to 145.550.  If you're a ham, you can talk directly to Astronaut
Garriott as explained above.  To make it more of a challenge, the

for only 8 minutes sometime during the end of the week of October 31.

Here are a few random offerrings from the CSC in Colorado Springs.  First, to
start out with a few (entirely true) overheard telephone conversations:

SPECIALIST:  You want to know what the NOP instruction does?

My personal favorite is the customer who called up the day after thunderstorms
raised havoc with his computer room.  This is true (I spoke to him myself):

CUSTOMER:  "Well, we had a bad rainstorm and my roof leaks.   This morning, the
CPU wasn't running (it had water all over it...), the RK07 with my system disk
has no lights on, and the other RK07 has a fault light on.   Since the first
RK07 has my system disk in it and I can't get the door open, would it be OK if
I put may backup system disk in DM1: and used it?  That drive has less water
on top of it..."

or this:

CUSTOMER:  "I think I've found a bug in RSX.  I've got 10 users on my 11/34,
and if I watch the system with RMDEMO, I notice that tasks keep moving around
in memory!".

Hmmmm, truly 'dynamic storage', methinks.

Under the 'At Least He's Honest' catagory:

A customer who hadn't gotten a Software Dispatch for a while:  "Yeah, we've
ordered those things three times before.  I guess the guy who used to work
here gets 'em at home.  But, what the hell, order them again.  Hell, we're the
government--we'll pay for anything!"

To really enjoy the previous statement, you have to imagine a 'good old boy'
from the deep south with a drawl to match.

From the Boston Globe, August 30, 1983:

        Navy Secretary John Lehman has recommended that Capt. Grace
        Hopper, a 76-year-old computer pioneer, be promoted to the
        one-star rank of commodore. "This promotion is in recognition
        of Capt. Hopper's continuing extraordinary contribution to
        both the Navy and the nation," Lehman said in a statement
        yesterday. Capt. Hopper is the oldest military officer on
        active duty. She is widely recognized as one of those earliest
        in computer technology. "One of her many accomplishments...
        was creation of the widely used computer language COBOL,"
        Lehman said.

'Bout time, too.

        I have seen many definitions floating around for "hacker".  I
remember the list of items for  "Millrats".  Well, I thought it was time
for all volunteers to go at it  and give there best definition of
hacker.  Entries should be limited to 50 words are less.

        How about it?

If anyone would like to get involved with Greenpeace activities, I
can supply the names and addresses of people to write to regarding
current events.  Send mail to BABEL::LISA_DAVIS.  Some current hap-
penings to write protesting about are:

        1.  The capture of 100 Orca Whales by Sea World.
        2.  Friendly Ice Cream - they buy fish from whaling countries.
        3.  Good ole James Watt's plans to drill for oil and gas in
            the Outer Continental Shelf.
        4.  The assistant commissioner of education (that's right, the
            US of A) - he is negotiating buying fish for schools from
            whaling countries.
        5.  Your unwilling contribution to a $40 million dollar campaign
            promoting nuclear power by the US Committee for Energy
            Awareness.
