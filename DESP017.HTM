According to those who have looked into this, it is not--as it
appears--a pipe dream.  It is a real device that will change our
world:  A cheap read-only disk with cheap media and immense capacity.

A REPORT (SORT OF) ABOUT THE MEETING THAT INFORMED US ABOUT
THE OPTICAL DEVICE THAT DIGITAL IS BUILDING

IN SUMMARY:

        o  This device is inexpensive. It will probably be less
           than $1000

        o  It is small

        o  It has enormous storage capacity

        o  Because of its size and cost and capacity, it is an
           ideal medium for release distribution and on-line
           documentation.

The meeting presented many facts and numbers.  Because I am a
poor note taker when the information is delivered faster than I
write, I can only give you the salient points presented at the
meeting.

The essence of the information is this:

Digital is building an optical reader device.  It should be
working by early next year.  Its price should be a $1000 or less
to purchase.  It uses a laser beam to read optical holes in the
surface of the disk and the disk may be able to be read on two
sides.  Two-sided disks may come later.  The technology is being
developed by Digital in conjunction with Phillips, a European
company.  The disk is not large, less than 20 cm. in diameter.
Phillips has the technology to both create the master disks and
reproduce them.  Digital does not at the present time have the
technology available to reproduce the disks.  However, Digital
can obviously come to a business agreement to be able to both
produce disks and reproduce them.  Initial creation of the master
disk is expensive (I forgot the numbers) but reproduction of the
disk in quantity brings the price per disk down into the
neighborhood of $10-$20.

This disk and its reader is a read-only device.  The storage
capacity is enormous (trillions of bytes per disk).

The obvious and not-so-obvious uses for this device are as
follows:

 o  A high-density storage medium on which the entire system and
    ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION may be placed.

 o  The disk has so much storage capacity that the system and
    documentation may be recorded several times on the same disk.
    This allows multiple reads of the same information at different
    locations on the disk to enable error recovery in case bits
    are "dropped."  Information (bits) may be dropped during the
    reproduction process after the master is made.

o   On-line documentation means, for this device:

    a.  Manuals, as currently produced but displayed on the
        screen in page format; printable at the customers
        option.

    b.  Manuals, produced in tree structures or hierarchies
        of information.

    c.  Manuals, produced in screen sized (24x80 or 23x80 pixels)
        "frames" rather than pages as they are currently
        formatted.

    d.  Manuals, produced in a way that allows self-teaching
        and learning in an insidious way (like Computer Assisted
        Instruction)

    e.  For bit-mapped terminals (and graphic printers if the
        manuals are printed on-site), all the graphics that we
        can currently produce with conventional art.

    f.  Color is possible (future interest) for color terminals
        and with the proper writer tools/programming methodology.

    g.  Even animation is possible with the "right" design system
        and writer tools/programming methodology

This device can well alter the future of computer documentation
in a fundamental way.  IBM is delivering such a device next year,
though I doubt they have been able to do much yet with their
documentation. XEROX already has delivered such a system for the
Library of Congress.  Digital certainly intends to produce and
sell similar devices also.

The attractiveness of this device and its storage is obvious for
large information systems and mini-computers like ours.  For
example, a new release of the system (media, system code,
manuals) could be delivered (in an envelope to the customer via
mail) for about $20 media cost.

This is not only a revolution is storage capacity but a
revolution in cost and simplicity.  It also requires a revolution
in our own thinking about how we do things and to what end we do
them.

                    MICHAEL PALIN'S NEW MOVIE

Subject: movie review

I recommend "The Missionary," but only if you know what to expect.  Don't
look for the laff riot promised by the TV ad;  it's actually a delightfully
British comedy, which is to say it's low-key.  Reminded me of some of the
Peter Sellers films I saw in my youth, before he went to Hollywood.  Not too
many movies of this kind get shown here, so it's worth seeing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Peter Sellers was pretty funny in Hollywood too.  He made "Lolita" and
"Dr. Strangelove" there, And also "Being There", not to mention the Pink
Panther movies.

It just occured to me that "not to mention" is a phrase never to be
believed.

Another unbelieveable phrase, "I don't mean this personally, but . . . "

And another, "No pun intended".

        I just got some of the mail on bizarre call letters. I thought I'd
throw my two cents in by adding these. In San Antonio, Tejas, there is
a rocker called "KISS"; Buffalo, N.Y has a TV station WIVB (channel 4)
and Colorado Springs has a station called "KILO" also a rocker. Perhaps
the most nepotistic is KLBJ in Austin Texas which is owned by "Lady
Bird" Johnson and plays rock........When the going gets weird, the
weird turn pro...

Subject: DESPARADO

In a paper in a new journal, "Science of Computer Programming", Edsger
Dijkstra (whom we all know and admire) presents an important new algorithm,
smoothsort.  I quote the abstract:

        "Like heapsort - which inspired it- smoothsort is an algorithm for
        sorting in situ.  It is of order N*logN in the worst case, but of
        order N in the best case, with a smooth transition between the two."

The desperado is a quote from the last paragraph of his "In Retrospect"
section:

        "Besides the possible interest in smoothsort I had another reason for
        developing it to the degree I did and for writing the above. (It
        took me three weeks, but I consider them well-spent.)" [!]

        [The article is written in the inimitable style of his "A Discipline
        of Programming" book].

Subj:   Paul went to this place.

At a Pensylvania college, which shall remain nameless, they have come up with a
solution to the gas crunch.  They have replaced automobile engines with melons.
A watermelon replaced a V8, for example, and a cantaloup replaced a  motorcycle
engine.  The melons worked extremely well, and had only one major drawback: you
couldn't use an  electric starter  on them;  they had  to be  cranked by  hand.
Also, each  size  melon  required  a  different  crank.   Rather  than  have  a
proliferation of cranks, a four-armed "cross" was developed.  Each arm was  the
appropriate crank for  a different  melon size.   This proved  to be  unwieldy,
however, and eventually the arm for the motorcycle was removed and made into  a
separate crank  that was  easier to  use.  The  multi-purpose tool  became  "T"
shaped (an arm for each  of 8, 6, and 4  cylinder replacements).  This tool  is
now known as a "CarEngine Melon UniversalTee".

                      A MADAME FOR DESPERADOS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Somewhere on your dial--such as Boston Channel 38--at some time--such
as 11 o'clock each night--you'll find the low-brow fun of Madame's Place,
starring Madame, the old-bat hand puppet with a warm spot in her heart
and another warm spot somewhat lower.

Madame is a Southern charmer who started out as a Whoopie Girl--"When
we did our 'Bottoms Up' number, there wasn't a dry seat in the house!"
and after many lovers--"When I was at Camp Lejeune more Marines
landed on me than landed on Okinawa!"--and 30 mediocre movies, has
managed to claw her way up to hosting a talk show--"It wasn't easy
climbing all the way to the middle!"

The show is structured something like the Jack Benny program or The
Muppet Show.  Part of the action is on Madame's talk show, called
Madame's Place and featuring Ivan Alhambra and the Madame's Place
All-Divorced Orchestra.  Her talk show always features wonderfully dumb
performers, such as a ventriloquist whose dummy was a TV set with the
ventriloquist talking on it. Or the guy who came out and operated a
lot of squeeze-bulb rubber toys.  One time, Madame appeared in a
multicolor fright wig singing a parody of "Bette Davis Eyes" called
"Barbra Streisand's Nose."  The rest of the action is off-stage and deals
with Madame and her family and friends and neighbors.

The pace is fast.  There's something new almost every night.  For the last
few nights, they've been haunted by the ghosts of Groucho and Harpo
Marx.  Madame's household consists of herself, her wacky repressed
secretary, Pinkerton, her former lover and present butler, and her
niece, Sara Joy Pitts, who has come to Hollywood seeking fame and
fortune.

Let me see how I can put this.  Sara Joy is a beautiful naive young
woman.  OR, Sara Joy is a dumb blonde.  She's played by Judy Denton,
who's just about the best dumb blonde since Goldy Hawn, and with a
figure that even Ms. Magazine would have to admire, although Ms. never
would, of course.  Sara Joy dresses lightly, but she wears it well.

The Madame puppet is owned and operated by Wayland Flowers, but,
unlike other times you've seen Madame on TV, you never see him.
Madame is completely integrated into the human cast, and although the
budget is not on the Muppet level, Wayland Flowers is a brilliant
manipulator.  You hardly notice the wires for the hands and the
unchanging facial expression because Madame's personality and style
are so engaging.  Her wardrobe is frankly fabulous, as they say in
Vogue.

I'd love to see Madame go up against Miss Piggy some day.

It ain't clever satire; it is low farce; but I like it like that.
