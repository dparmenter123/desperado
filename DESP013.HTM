I know the difference between it's and its.  An eleventh-grade English
teacher flunked me on a paper (otherwise A- work) because I blew it -
once.  I haven't had any trouble since, so the F was worth it.  There's
a moral here, but never mind...

(I also know what the word "comprise" means and doesn't mean, a
bit of knowldege that - like virginity - is becoming a vanishing
commodity in today's world.  Get my soapbox, quick!)

`BOS's list left off everything in the non-commercial part of the FM dial.
Although most of the stations down there are 10 watts, there are a few that
can be picked up in more than one or two towns.

I spend some of my free time at the University of Lowell radio station,
WJUL, 91.5FM.  We can be heard north to about Manchester and west to about
Hudson, MA.  What I do there is produce a local acoustic music series featuring
people from all over the area who are interested in performing folk, folk-jazz,
folk-rock, jazz-rock, and however many combinations I left off.  Most of these
amateur musicians have been very, very good.  If any Desperadoes have
musical fingers and would like to hear themselves "live on tape" on the radio,
they can send me a line. [The show "Underground Coffeehouse" can be heard
every other (or so) Sunday evening at 10.]

Along with the call letters, frequency and 25 letter characterization
you might request the derivation of the call letters.  I've always
found those fun.  Here a few I already know:

        GBH - Great Blue Hill
        TBS - Tech Broadcasting System
        CRB - Concert Radio Boston
        BCN - Boston Concert Network
        RBB - Radio Back Bay

Some of these meanings are made up after the fact and some before.  In
Chicago, WGN stands for World's Greatest Newspaper (the Tribune, which
owns WGN), and WLS (when they had Dick Biondi, one of the greatest Top-40
stations of all time) stands for World's Largest Store because Sears
once owned it.  As for after-the-fact ones, WIOD Miami Beach = Wonderful
Isle Of Dreams, and WSB Atlanta = Welcome South Brother.  WTBS at MIT
sold the call letters to Ted Turner for $50,000.  In the old days,
call letters had no meaning, hence WBZ, WMAZ, KDKA, WFAA.  Does
anybody know what KDKA and WFAA have in common?  WVBF is the Voice of
Boston and Framingham.  There are a whole bunch of black-programmed
stations with OK in the call letters, including my old favorite WAOK
in Atlanta, which had those letters before the term became common, and
also had the great deejays, Daddy Sears, Alley Pat the Alley Rat, and
*The* Piano Red.  We had an all-female-deejay station in St. Louis
called WSDM, which was Smack-Dab in the Middle of the FM dial.  The
great rhythm-and-blues station in Nashville, WLAC was owned by the
Life and Casualty Insurance Company. (This station is heard very
clearly all over the South and even in Canada and the Caribbean.  Its
music--played by Gene Nobles, Hoss Allen, John R., and Herman
Grizzard for various mail-order record stores--was greatly influential
in the development of reggae.)

Hi Tom,

        I saw a bumper sticker in downtown Hudson today which reminded
me of your former desperado pal, Armen. If you print the message please
list me as one of those phantom accounts.

        Old bridge players never die, they just sit around on their
        fat aces.

The lines from "Plan Nine from Outer Space" reminded me of another dialog
which would have been better omitted from a film. (In fact, the whole script
should have been omitted.) The movie is "Bilitis," directed by the English
photographer, David Hamilton. Desperados may be familiar with Hamilton's photo
portfolios, which consist entirely of gauzy, romantic treatments of young
girls who, apparently, are just reaching adolescence and are beginning to get
intrigued with themselves. (My photographer uncle, when he saw me looking at
a Hamilton book in a store, said, "That guy's work is just soft-core
pornography." "Whattaya mean Just?" I asked.)

Well, anyway, "Bilitis" is a feature-length film of which almost every
frame could be reproduced in one of Hamilton's books. (It IS visually
beautiful, boys and girls.) It was shot in France and has an
apparently overdubbed English script. Bilitis is a lovely young girl
attending a boarding school in the French countryside. She cavorts
with her school chums and gets some extracurricular training from local young
men and her beautiful older (female) cousin. If you can stomach this sort
of thing, you'd really like the film; however, you'll soon wish it were
silent. For example, in one scene, Bilitis gets flustered while trying to
perform in the school pageant and runs off the stage. Two ladies in the
audience make the following clever observations:

        Lady 1: It's only youth.
        Lady 2: Yes, it will pass with age.

As if this weren't enough, the lines are not properly synchronized with
their mouths. In another, she gets a little overwhelmed when a would-be
boyfriend tries to put the moves on her in a barn, and she takes off (Bilitis
runs away from things a lot). As he pursues her out the barn door, the
boy is accosted by a leering old peasant:

        Old geezer: Why's she running away? [Leer, leer]
        Boy:    [spreading hands in exasperation] She's a virgin!
        Geezer: Arrr-har-har!

After a few more equally banal declamations, I left in disgust, so I can't
tell you whether Bilitis ever gets over her squeamishness about men. Anyone
out there know?

One of my favorites came from "Target Earth" (a Richard Denning epic of the
mid-50's): a Martian robot has been captured, and is being examined by top
scientific and military brass in a high-security lab deep in the mountains of
New Mexico. The top brass look first at the robot, then at the multitude of
gauges and scopes attached to it, then at one another. Finally one of them
speaks.

        "So that's how they do it - electronics!"

Today is Guy Fawkes Day.  Every anarchist should take heed of it.

The following is from the Random House Encyclopedia:

"GUNPOWDER PLOT, conspiracy to blow up the English Parliament and
King James I on Nov.5, 1605, the day set for the king to open
Parliament.  It was intended to be the beginning of a great uprising
of English Catholics, who were distressed [I like that, "distressed"]
by the increased severity of penal laws against the practice of their
religion.  The conspirators, who began plotting early in 1604, expanded
their number to a point where secrecy was impossible [so much for
evangelism].  They included Robert Catesby, John Wright, Robert Winter,
Robert Keyes, Guy Fawkes, a soldier who had been serving in Flanders,
Thomas Percy, John Grant, Sir Everard Digby, Francis Tresham, Ambrose
Rookwood, and Thomas Bates.  Percy hired a cellar under the House of Lords,
in which 36 barrels of gunpowder, overlaid [see?  overlays aren't new] with
iron bars and firewood, were secretly stored.  [Whew!  Random House writers
love commas!]  The conspiracy was brought to light through a mysterious
letter received by Lord Monteagle [now at DG], a brother-in-law of
Tresham, on Oct 26, urging him not to attend Parliament on the opening
day.  The 1st earl of Salisbury and others, to whom the plot was made
known, took steps leading to the discovery of the materials and the
arrest of Fawkes as he entered the cellar.  Other conspirators,
overtaken in flight or seized afterward, were killed outright,
imprisoned, or executed.  Among those executed was Henry Garnett, the
superior of the English Jesuits, who had known of the consiracy.
While the plot was the work of a small number of men, it damaged the
cause of all English Catholics and led to an increase in the harshness
of laws against them.  Guy Fawkes Day, Nov. 5, is still celebrated in
England with fireworks and bonfires, on which effigies of the
conspirator are burned..."

All I really wanted was more entertaining examples from DEC documentation.

I know I may live to regret this, but I think Maloney's offer to be VMS
docko ombudsman is a great idea.  And I'd like to volunteer to do the
same thing for RSX documentation.  So, if you desperadi have anything
to say about RSX/RMS or AME documentation, send mail to KERMIT::CHARLA
and I'll see that the appropriate parties get the word.  Obviously we
can't promise to do everything you ask, but if you don't ask, we just
as obviously won't do it for sure.
