Not an official publication.  Forward with daring and whimsy.  Circle the earth.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Speaking of circling the earth, the one difference between
        Desperado and all the other flotsam'n'jetsam on the net is that
        Desperado is filtered and folded, by which I mean that I
        don't forward everything that comes my way and I don't forward
        anything right away.  I let it sit and stew for a week to a month
        in the hopes that there will be time for the cream to rise to the
        top and the sludge to sink to the bottom before I go to press.  (I
        also correct some mispellings and do a little reformatting, delete
        the Internet footers, and sometimes redistribute only part of a
        message.)

        As Desperado travels farther and farther outside its origins in
        the bowels of the world's largest private computer network without
        a REPLY/ALL feature in its mail system, we're in danger of running
        into a little difficulty that concerns me.  You folks outside of
        DEC can do a REPLY/ALL (generic syntax) to one of these issues and
        thus send mail to everybody outside DEC, plus Publisher John
        Covert.  John sends it to me, and I suddenly realize that people
        on the list are getting unprocessed data, contrary to the premise
        and promise of Desperado.

        Now, probably, a certain amount of this is going to happen,
        because that's the way these other mail systems work, but I sure
        do wish y'all would send your contributions directly to me
        instead.  If not, everybody else should know if they get something
        from John Covert, it is in fact coming from me and John and we're
        fully ir/responsible for it, no matter how garbagoid it may be.
        If it wings in from someone else, it ain't us, babe, no matter how
        brilliant it may be.

        Flags spotted between Flag Day and the Fourth of July:  three
        dozen little ones in with all the other picnic goods at the
        supermarket, T-shirt at the baseball game with 50 baseballs in
        place of the stars, Campbell's Soup collectible ad from the 1890s
        with 44 soup cans in place of the stars (O death where is thy
        sting, eh, Andy?), paper fans in flag motif, flags flying from
        every antenna in a used-car lot, gigantic flags flying over Burger
        Kings in New Hampshire, and Mike Royko's survey of the police and
        fire departments of the three largest cities in the country to
        discover not one single flag-burning incident reported.  Why
        Robert  Dole  and George Bush want to give three punk-politicos
        and 500 Iranian mob-incitement experts their own Constitutional
        amendment remains beyond me.  Royko's answer:  "They think we're
        kind of stupid."

        Royko asked the New York cops if anybody was burning flags.  The
        NYPD answer:  "Nah.  And if they do, nobody'd notice. It's not
        like somebody setting fire to himself.  They do that in front of
        the United Nations."

        Presumably not, however, a suitable case for Constitutional amendment.

  Taxonomically, or possibly even cladistically, the English recognise a
  sub-grouping of thorpes. In particular this involves the  duothorpes.

  There are two groups recognised:

  1. The straight (or conventional) duothorpes viz: | \ / _ -

  2. The bent duothorpes  viz: ^ v &gt; &lt;

     the bent duothorpes are more commonly known as Jeremy Thorpes for
     reasons best left unexplained here but well known to those people
     interested in English politics.

Subject:     Navstar GPS Status Reports on WWV and WWVH

National Institute of Standards and Technology time signal radio
stations WWV and WWVH transmit brief reports on the status of the
Navstar Global Positioning System.  These reports are prepared by the
U.S. Coast Guard's Omega Navigation Systems Center (ONSCEN) in
Alexandria, VA.  The broadcast from WWV is at 15 minutes past each hour.
A brief description of GPS is given in the preceding minute.  The
broadcast from WWVH is at 44 minutes past each hour with the
introduction during the preceding minute.  The broadcasts are updated
nominally once a day.

WWV, Fort Collins, CO, transmits continuously on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20
MHz.  WWVH, Kauai, Hawaii, transmits continuously on 2.5, 5, 10, and 15
MHz.  Only a simple shortwave receiver is needed to pick up these
broadcasts.

Both stations also transmit solar activity and geomagnetic field reports
as well as Omega navigation system status reports and weather.  The
"program" schedule for WWV and WWVH is as follows:

WWV
H:08  North Atlantic weather
H:09  North Atlantic weather cont'd.
H:10  East Pacific weather
H:14  GPS message introduction
H:15  GPS status report
H:16  Omega status report
H:18  Solar activity / geomagnetic field report

WWVH
H:43  GPS message introduction
H:44  GPS status report
H:45  Solar activity / geomagnetic field report
H:47  Omega status report
H:48  Pacific weather
H:49  Pacific weather cont'd.
H:50  Pacific weather cont'd.
H:51  Pacific weather cont'd.

Try as I may, I can't get the FORTRAN connection.  Perhaps our publisher,
who used to interview job candidates by asking them FORTRAN brainteasers
(and may yet), can supply the context.  Even without the connection I thought
it was entertaining.  As I remember, these government radio stations
communicate primarily by means of low-frequency thumps.

The following was received as an email message from a friend at Penn

The originator of this message is Dimitri Mihalas.

For those who want the condensed version, the software that
Perkin-Elmer used to polish the mirror was faulty.

Message follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
in case you have not heard: from a reliable inside source i found out
that the problem with ST is that the SOFTWARE driving the polisher was
defective. the corrections for spherical aberration were put in with the
wrong sign. consequently the mirror is not corrected for sph. abb., but
has an added dose of it.

the error was not detected during testing because no test with collimated
light was ever done. (editorial remark: unthinkable!) apparently this was
a $30M economy measure in the face of the Challenger accident. likewise
none of the optics were ever tested in vacuum. the primary was and is
"perfect" relative to the specified curve; but alas the specification
was wrong. sigh.

&gt;from my amateur astronomer days (does that include 1990?) i recall that
spherical aberration is EASY to detect with the foucault test, which is
done with a pinhole, not collimated light. it is hard to believe that
ANYONE could have made such a blunder..

the only reason that people know this much is that the same software
was used for AXAF. the errors there were so huge as to be immediately
noticeable, and when the software was corrected, the mirror was "perfect".
i don't know whether the information from axaf was available prior to
the launch of ST, but it seems that it had to be. in which case one
wonders why PE didn't issue a "hold everything!".

the future: no chance of bringing the whole telescope down for a refit.
best plan is to design compensating optics into the lightpath for future
instruments: relatively easy to do. but that will still take 3-5 years.

i suppose it's "win a few, lose a few..." but i personally think that
nasa, the government, and the people should stick it into PE and TURN
it hard until they agree to refund the cost of the mistake and of the repairs.
i'm sick of seeing defense and defense-related contractors get away
with bloody murder and just get fatter and fatter on the profits.

One of the more obscure forms of humor are the signs on the backs of
trucks warning drivers to pass on the left, not on the right.
Pairs such as "Pass -- Fail", "Win -- Lose", and "Heaven -- Hell"
are common.  My favorite, though, is "Grateful -- Dead".

The Army used to circulate a pair of bumper stickers, "CHOICE" for the
left side and "CHANCE" for the right side.  The Platonic classic, of course is
"PASSING SIDE" and "SUICIDE", which predates bumper stickers.  "Caution,
vehicle makes wide right turns" just doesn't cut it, even with the spiffy
graphic that shows a car getting crunched by a truck the point of impact
marked with a huge X.

Subj:   Marketing Man Gets Choice - Heaven or Hell

    This fellow who had worked in advertising/marketing died and, upon
    entering Heaven, met St. Peter.  St. Peter said, "In the interest
    of fairness, we want to give you the option to stay here in Heaven,
    or to go to Hell.  You can look around here for a few minutes, then
    go visit Hell for a while before you decide.  The catch is that your
    decision is final - no changing your mind."

    So, the fellow started walking around Heaven;  what he saw, he thought
    to be a bit boring.  People were playing horseshoes, bridge, drinking
    tea.  It wasn't bad, but it did look kind of slow.  He mentioned this
    to St. Peter, and asked for his visit to Hell before his decision.

    Immediately, he found himself standing in front of two huge doors
    imprinted with "HELL".  Expecting the handle to be hot, he reached
    gingerly for it.  Surprisingly, the handle was cool to the touch.
    Proceeding through the doors, he found a flurry of activity.  People
    were standing around eating, drinking, dancing - in general having
    a great time.  The marketing fellow thought that this looked like
    much more fun than Heaven, so he promptly returned to St. Peter and
    told him that he had chosen Hell.

    Once again, he found himself in front of the huge doors.  Reaching
    to open the door, he scorched his hand on the blisteringly hot
    handle.  After entering, he was faced with a wall of flame, and he
    could hear horrendous screaming and moaning.  He stood there, in-
    credulous.  The devil walked up and asked if there was some problem.
    "Yes," the fellow replied.  "I was just down here ten minutes ago,
    and it wasn't hot, and people were partying and having a great time!
    What happened?"
&lt;FF&gt;
        "Well, yes", the devil replied, "but that was a Demo!"

[The following is a lengthening and amending of the spring press release.]

Using large mobile machines, mechanical devices, explosives, and the
reactions of the audience, Survival Research Labs stages allegories
and dramas to explore, explain, and exploit the human condition.

Since the May 1989 San Francisco performance "ILLUSIONS OF SHAMELESS
ABUNDANCE: DEGENERATING INTO AND UNINTERRUPTED SEQUENCE OF HOSTILE
ENCOUNTERS" and the ArtSpace installation July 20 - Aug 11 several new
devices have been built or prototyped and a couple of shows have been
planned.

                         Shows and Videos

The next confirmed performance for SRL will take place in Seattle on
June 23, 1990.  The producer/sponsor is COCA (the Center on Contemporary
Art) who sponsored our 1986 show "FAILURE TO DISCRIMINATE:...."  The
site is an old railroad yard near the Kingdome.  The gods are angry, and
SRL will use this show to explain why.

There will be a show on September 1 at ArtPark in New York, and
probably a show in California in the fall.

In June a new video directed by Jon Reiss and Leslie Gladsjo and edited
by Leslie Gladsjo will be released.  It will include the May 28th "ILLUSIONS
OF SHAMELESS ABUNDANCE:..." and the ArtSpace installation.  Leslie has
included many unusual video clips including some on last summers's
SRL bomb hoax.

                        High-Energy Physics

One completed device is based on electromagnetic rail gun technology.
Rather than firing a projectile at high speeds for kinetic effects or
other droll, destructive military objectives this device employs similar
capacitor energy storage units to liquefy a metal bar and magnetically
eject the molten blob at about 200 mph.  It appears to the eye as a
comet-like beam that fragments on impact, tending to set fire to any
nearby combustibles.  This machine, with its long-distance, arson-like
capabilities is SRL's answer to George Bush's call for a thousand
points of light.

We are building a tesla coil based on the largest one Tesla himself ever
built.  The long streaming sparks will add a festive, apocalyptic touch
to the summer's performances.

The 80 kilojoule Shock Box is being refurbished, and will soon be ready
to accept and destroy gifts of cans, cabbages, calculators, and other
tokens of respect.  Its Death Grid will be augmented by a pair of probes,
allowing the machine to further extend its field of influence.

                        Noisemakers

The power supply and prototype of a powerful low frequency generator
have been completed.  It produces 2000 acoustic watts at 100 Hz
and creates disturbing but pleasant resonances in the human body and in
structures.  The finished device is based on a patent for the loudest
whistle yet built and will generate about 30 kilowatts at 80-90 Hz.  The
finished device will be radio-controlled and mobile and as it is a
phased array of whistles it will be directional as well.  Several
variations of other designs operating at lower frequencies will also be
constructed this spring.  For more detailed information on these devices
SRL will be cooperating with AMOK BOOKS in LA to print a book on sound
weapons and their effects with step by step instructions on their
construction.

Also along these lines is a prototype V-1 rocket engine, based on the
original German designs.  This irresistible force will be kept earthboud
by an immovable object, and the pair will be made free to roam the area.
The rocket will be vented through a whistle, producing 30,000 acoustic

                       Computer Control

Small mobile machines that exhibit flocking or mob type behavior are
being constructed.  Ultimately 30 to 50 of these devices are planned.
Each has an on-board computer and sensors to identify other swarming
machines and transmit its own identity.  A distributed radio link sends
data from a control computer to change the overall behavior patterns;
the machines are also capable of being completely autonomous, with
no interference from a human operator or any other controlling
influence.  Some of the machines will have whips mounted on them,
and others will have noise-making devices

The first flocking machine can follow people around now; its companions
are in progress.  This example of emergent behavior owes much of its
fabric to third- and fourth-hand military motors and gun-positioning
sensors.  Building and employing these devices in performances is a
response to the increased influence mob behavior has in determining
world events.

The Screw Machine, last seen in Copenhagen, is getting a new motor.
We are contemplating giving it a computer, but haven't figured out
how to make the machine navigate -- its drive and steering mechanism
are one and the same, and have enough chains and couplings in them to
move one to madness or ecstasy.  We have thought about using some sort of
inertial guidance system, or perhaps borrowing data from a convenient
geo-positioning satellite.  Suggestions are welcome.

                       Large Mechanicals

The Big Arm, sacrificed on a pyre of pianos at ILLUSIONS is being
reconstructed.  It will have a second, smaller arm added, giving it
increased grasping potential, and the ability to walk and carry at the
same time.

The running machine is in progress; it will be one of the fastest
machines with legs -- 6 m.p.h or so initially, and greater than
10 once the computer-controlled suspension is added.  It has
six legs, arranged as a tripod with two legs at each point.  Its
offensive weaponry is stil under consideration.

The hopping machine (a.k.a Stu's Spider) is being considered for
rejuvenation.  Since Stu has gone to that great big Habitrail (TM)
in the sky, we will use a Motorola 68HC11 to run it.  This will also
put to rest the lingering controversy about the respective merits of
digital control and guinea pig technology.

SRL needs and welcomes help with its work.  There is always lots to
get done just to keep the place running, and even more to get a show
ready.  What we need most are:

  metalworking ( e.g. welding, lathe operators)
  mechanical assemblers and engineers (hydraulics, engine work, and so on)
  electronics (small and large scale wiring, board layout and assembly, etc.)
  software (packet radio protocols, code for new machines, for example)

Closer to show time, we also need people to scavenge, build, and paint
props; prepare the performance site; and do lights, sound, and similar
production-related stuff.

Subject: A flare for the unusual
From: snider@inf.ethz.ch
Date: 20 May 90 10:30:06 GMT

Reading jerry298's story about the life-raft in the VW inspired me to write
down an incident that happened to me about 10 years ago.  Like Jerry, it
took me about 5 years to see the humor in it.

About 10 years ago, I bought a used van to drive back and forth to my cottage
on weekends.  It had previously been owned by a company called "Canada Dredge
and Dock".  This gave it some notoriety since they were at the time involved
in a big local political scandal involving rigged bidding on dredging
contracts.  One weekend at the cottage I was giving it a good cleaning out
when I discovered a red cylinder labeled "Emergency Flare" in one of the door
pockets.  I thought "Well, that's not a bad thing to have in the car." and
left it there.  Sure enough, on the way home that weekend, we had a flat tire.
I should say that our cottage is in the middle of a very popular vacation
area north of Toronto, and the weekend in question was the combined Canadian
July 1st and American July 4th holiday weekend.  So the entire world was
headed home on the same road.  I got out to change the tire and my
brother-in-law said "Have you got an emergency flare in the van?".  I told
him about the one I had found and he ran down the road a few hundred feet to
set it up.  I was under the van setting up the jack when I heard a loud pop.
I looked out to see Ron running towards me yelling "It's a marine flare".
That's right, Canada Dredge and Dock, being a largely marine based company, had
left a marine emergency flare in their truck.  In case anybody doesn't know,
a marine flare is like a very powerful roman candle, shooting balls of light
hundreds of feet up in the air so that drowning sailors will be seen by passing
ships.  They are NOT intended to be set off late at night on a busy highway.
The first ball had missed Ron's face by about 2 inches and the force had
tipped the flare over onto the little mound that he had made to hold it in
place.  Now, as each ball came shooting out, the force would spin the flare
on the little mound, so that no two went in the same direction.  One of them
shot right at us and passed between us as we stood no more than 5 feet apart.
One of them shot back up the road at 3 lanes of oncoming traffic.  One of them
shot up into a farmer's field and started a small fire.  Neither of us was
about to go back and try to pick it up.  Finally after about 7 or 8 shots,
it stopped.  Amazingly, the shots that went up the highway came between platoons
of traffic so nobody was hit, nobody even went off the road.  Ron went and
put out the fire, I changed the tire, and we drove to the nearest pull-off and
sat there shaking for half an hour.

Subj:   Democratic bug in AppleLink!

From: LAICHI.SPT@AppleLink.Apple.COM (Axis, Hector Rojas, Chile,ICC)

There is a peculiar bug in the AppleLink application which, taking into
account the country in which I currently live (Chile) made me sit up
and grin.  (The AppleLink application is a nice front end for Apple
Computer's worldwide electronic mail and bulletin board system.)

This is the bug:

  1  Write a new memo and save it using the name "General".
  2  Quit to the Finder or switch to it if you're using MultiFinder.
  3  Now try to find the file "General".  It's not there!

This problem occurs in both AppleLink version 4 and version 5....
As far as I only it only  happens with documents saved as "General".

[...]

However, after a while the logic behind the "General's disappearing act"
dawned on me: some of you may remember that only two months ago, Chile's
former dictatorial regime, headed by General Augusto Pinochet, was
replaced by the democratically elected president Patricio Aylwin.

So remember from now on: General will always disappear :)

Subj:   A wedding disaster

    I have married more than a thousand times.  Officiated as the minister
    at a whole lot of weddings and usually managed to get so involved in
    each occasion that it felt like I was the one getting married.  Still,
    I always look forward to marrying again, because most weddings are such
    comedies.

    Not that they are intended as such.  But since weddings are high state
    occasions involving amateurs under pressure, everything NEVER goes
    right.  Weddings seem to be magnets for mishap and for whatever
    craziness lurks in family closets.  In more ways than one, weddings
    bring out the ding-dong in everybody involved.

    I will tell you the quintessential wedding tale.  One of disaster.
    Surprisingly, it has a happy ending, though you may be in doubt, as I
    was, as the story unfolds.

    The central figure in this drama was the mother of the bride (MOTB).
    Not the bride and groom or minister.  Mother.  Usually a polite,
    reasonable, intelligent, and sane human being, Mother was mentally
    unhinged by the announcement of her daughter's betrothal.  I don't mean
    she was unhappy, as is often the case.  To the contrary.  She was
    overcome with joy.  And just about succeeded in overcoming everybody
    else with her joy before the dust settled.

    Nobody knew it, but this lady had been waiting with a script for a
    production that would have met with Cecil B. DeMille's approval.  A
    royal wedding fit for a princess bride.  And since it was her money, it
    was hard to say no.  The father of the bride began to pray for an
    elopement.  His prayers were not to be answered.

    She had seven months to work, and no detail was left to chance or human
    error.  Everything that could be engraved was engraved.  There were
    teas and showers and dinners.  The bride and groom I met with only
    three times.  The MOTB called me weekly, and was in my office as often
    as the cleaning lady.  (The caterer called me to ask if this was really
    a wedding, or an invasion he was involved in.  "Invasion," I told him.)

    An eighteen-piece brass and wind ensemble was engaged.  (The church
    organ simply would not do - too "churchy.")  The bride's desires for
    home furnishings were registered in stores as far east as New York and
    as far south as Atlanta.  Not only were the bridesmaid's outfits made
    to order, but the tuxedos for the groom and his men were bought - not
    rented, mind you.  Bought.  If all that wasn't enough, the engagement
    ring was returned to the jeweler for a larger stone, quietly subsidized
    by the MOTB.  When I say the lady came unhinged, I mean UNHINGED.

    Looking back, it seems now that the rehearsal and dinner on the evening
    before the great event were not unlike what took place in Napoleon's
    camp the night before Waterloo.  Nothing had been left to chance.
    Nothing could prevent a victory on the coming day.  Nobody would EVER
    forget this wedding.  (Just as nobody ever forgot Waterloo.  For the
    same reason, as it turned out.)

    The juggernaut of fate rolled down the road, and the final hour came.
    Guests in formal attire packed the church.  Enough candles were lit to
    bring daylight back to the evening.  In the choir loft the orchestra
    gushed great music.  And the mighty MOTB coasted down the aisle with
    the grandeur of an opera diva at the premier performance.  Never did the
    mother of the bride take her seat with more satisfaction.  She had done
    it.  She glowed, beamed, smiled, and sighed.

    The music softened, and nine - count them, nine - chiffon-draped
    bridesmaids lockstepped down the long aisle while the befrocked groom
    and his men marched stolidly into place.

    Finally, oh so finally, the wedding march thundered from the orchestra.
    Here comes the bride.  Proceeded by four enthusiastic mini-princesses
    chunking flower petals, and two dwarfish ringbearers - one for each
    ring.  The congregation rose and turned in anticipation.

    Ah, the bride.  She had been dressed for hours if not days.  No
    adrenalin was left in her body.  Left alone with her father in the
    reception hall of the church while the march of the maidens went on and
    on, she had walked along the tables laden with gourmet goodies and
    absentmindedly sampled first the little pink and yellow and green
    mints.  Then she picked through the silver bowls of mixed nuts and ate
    the pecans.  Followed by a cheeseball or two, some black olives, a
    handful of glazed almonds, a little sausage with a frilly toothpick
    stuck in it, a couple of shrimps blanketed in bacon, and a cracker
    piled with liver pate.  To wash this down - a glass of pink champagne.
    Her father gave it to her.  To calm her nerves.

    What you noticed as the bride stood in the doorway was not her dress,
    but her face.  White.  For what was coming down the aisle was a living
    grenade with the pin pulled out.

    The bride threw up.

    Just as she walked by her mother.

    And by "threw up," I don't mean a polite little ladylike *urp* into her
    handkerchief.  She puked.  There's just no nice word for it.  I mean,
    she hosed the front of the chancel - hitting two bridesmaids, the
    groom, a ringbearer, and me.

    I am quite sure of the details.  We have it all on videotape.  Three
    cameras' worth.  The MOTB had thought of everything.

    Having disgorged her hors d'oeuvres, champagne, and the last of her
    dignity, the bride went limp in her father's arms, while her groom sat
    down on the floor where he had been standing, too stunned to function.
    And the mother of the bride fainted, slumping over in rag-doll
    disarray.

    We had a fire drill then and there at the front of the church that only
    the Marx Brothers could have topped.  Groomsmen rushed about
    heroically, mini-princess flower girls squalled, bridesmaids sobbed,
    and people with weak stomachs headed for the exits.  All the while,
    unaware, the orchestra played on.  The bride had not only come, she was
    gone - into some other state of consciousness.  The smell of fresh
    retch drifted across the church and mixed with the smell of guttering
    candles.  Napoleon and Waterloo came back to mind.

    Only two people were seen smiling.  One was the mother of the groom.
    And the other was the father of the bride.

    What did we do?  Well, we went back to real life.  Guests were invited
    to adjourn to the reception hall, though they did not eat or drink as
    much as they might have in different circumstances.  The bride was
    consoled, cleaned up, fitted out with a bridemaid's dress, and hugged
    and kissed a lot by the revived groom.  (She'll always love him for
    that.  When he said "for better or worse," he meant it.)  The cast was
    reassembled where we left off, a single flute played a quiet air, the
    words were spoken and the deed was done.  Everybody cried, as people
    are supposed to do at weddings, mostly because the groom held the bride
    in his arms through the whole ceremony.  And no groom ever kissed his
    bride more tenderly than he.

    If one can hope for a wedding that it be memorable, then theirs was a
    raging success.  NOBODY who was there will EVER forget it.

    They lived as happily ever after as anyone does - happier than most, in
    fact.  They have been married about twelve years now, and have three
    lively children.

    But that's not the end of the story.  The best part is still to come.
    On the tenth anniversary of this disastrous affair, a party was held.
    Three TV sets were mustered, a feast was laid, and best friends
    invited.  (Remember, there were three video cameras at the scene of the
    accident, so all three films were shown at once.)  The event was
    hilarious, especially with the running commentary and the stop-action
    stuff that is a little gross when seen one frame at a time.  The part
    that got cheers and toasts was when the camera focused on the grin on
    the face of the father of the bride as he contemplates his wife as she
    is being revived.

    The reason I say this is the best part is not because of the party.
    But because of who organized it.  Of course.  The infamous MOTB.  The
    mother of the bride is still at it, but she's a lot looser these days.
    She not only forgave her husband and everybody else for their part in
    the debacle, she forgave herself.  And nobody laughed harder at the
    film than she.

    There's a word for what she has.  Grace.

    And that's why that same grinning man has been married to he for forty
    years.  And why her daughter loves her still.

Subj:   Foul ball

&gt;From the Globe:

"A couple in one of the rooms at Toronto's SkyDome Hotel that overlooks
the field made love in full view of part of a crowd of 40,000 Blue Jay
baseball fans at a game last week.  `We are are now going to post some
simple rules and regulations in the rooms,' hotel manager Ray Thompson
said Friday.  `There also will be an acknowledgment by the guest that
the room in effect becomes part of the stadium, just as if it were a
seat down below.'  The SkyDome Hotel is part of the domed baseball
stadium complex.  It has 348 rooms, 70 of which face the ballpark.  On
Tuesday, a woman wrapped in a towel and a naked man watched the Blue
Jays play the Seattle Mariners from the window of their hotel room.  As
the innings wore on, the couple apparently wearied of the game and
turned to more amatory endeavors.  The lights were off in the hotel
room, but the banks of ballpark lights revealed all.  `The fact that
people are sitting below you in the stands means we can't have people
doing things they shouldn't be doing, and in the public eye,' Thompson
said."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Reforms that resulted from this incident:  People who rent these rooms are
warned that thousands are watching; people who rent these rooms are
counted in the paid attendance at the game; bellhops come by and bring
them programs; vendors come by and sell them peanuts and cracker jack.

When I was a filthy journalist, one office was across from a big hotel in
downtown Chicago.  We had mapped the room numbers to their phone numbers
and on slow news nights we used to call people up and ask if they weren't
ashamed of themselves, etc.

I was reading in Science News (the "USA Today" of the chinless engineer

extinction theory -- that the impact in question happened in the Caribbean
basin.  Suddenly I was overcome by that old walkin' bass line and heard:

The Dinosaur Extinction Walking Blues

Millions of years before your birth
Giant lizzards walked the earth.
Until a flaming cosmic goober
hit the earth
and raised a welt named Cuba. *

Screamin "Commies killed our dinosaurs!"
'Cause even though he looks like hell,
He's younger than that

There weren't no Caribbean basin
But when it came hurtlin' down here, Matey
It trashed the 'saurs
'N shocked the quartz on Haiti.

It threw mud up on the shores
And cleaned the clocks of the dinosaurs
By puttin a mess of dust and dirt
In the atmosphere
Of Mother Earth.

The skies turned dark and awful grey
Like New England's nicer days
And everything died from tiny grains
Of sand that broke
The world's food chains.

But the story has a happy ending:
&gt;From mouse to man we began descending.
Mammals got their chance to be
Dominant
In (recent) history.

The thing that we all have to face
Is that some where out there deep in space
Dark and fearsome, like a hornet,
There's a rock
With our name on it.

So, it's coming up on the Fourth of July and the republic still stands,
flag-burning is still Constitutional and everybody except 2-Live Crew has
freedom of speech, and even we here deep within the ventricles of American
capitalism have carved out a little zone where we can say some of what is
one our minds, and the Lithuanians and the Czechs and Bulgarians are
hacking a bit of space out for themselves, and the Chinese and their buddy
George Bush are playing a losing hand (as the mantle of heaven has not
returned to the current emperor or China) and maybe, just maybe, we
Americans will find the rest of the world so caught up with us that we'll
decide it's time for us to go off on yet another tangent.  So, look out
everyone, lay on ground before lighting.

Your buddy,
