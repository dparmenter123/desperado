Subj:   dean-like drive

Some thirty years ago a fellow high-school student became fascinated by the
articles about the Dean Drive, and decided to construct one, or something like
it.

His version consisted of a metal bar, with a motor attached to the front end.
The motor caused a hammer to repetitively strike the rear end of the bar. The
principle of operation is quite simple. It is obvious that when the hammer
strikes the rear of the bar, that end of the bar moves forward. The shock wave
travels up the bar and eventually moves the front of the bar forward. Repeat
until you reach Mars.

He demonstrated the effectiveness of the drive by having it whack itself along
the floor. Of course its thrust to weight ratio was not sufficient for it to
lift straight up, due no doubt to his use of crude, low-tech materials. But it
would have worked in any direction in outer space, where there is no weight.

For some reason the reactionaries at NASA did not adopt the drive...

Subj:   A visit to italy

So here I am, in Italy for the first time in 25 years. Last time I was
here, I managed to visit every sight in Rome and go to sleep there (I was
fairly young at the time), outstanding in my memory is going to sleep in St
Peters...

This time, however, I have signally failed to sleep at all, due to general
unsettledness on the first night, a 4-hour-long loud thunderstorm the next
and last night, most spectacular of all, someone deciding that they'd sit
on top of a tall building in the same square as my hotel and lob glass
bottles onto the ground below to see if they'd bounce. Amazingly enough,
none did.

Thanks to this lack of sleep, I've discovered all kinds of, er, interesting
things on Italian TV. Well, there's "Il segreti di Twin Peaks" - I almost
caught what a damn fine cup o'coffee would have been but, there went
another bottle. There's also the games show that I caught the other night,
which seems to have 2 sections. In the first, the two contestants ( a man
and a woman ) answer questions whilst surrounded by scantily clad women.
Then there's a break wherein several of the scantily clad women do a strip
routine. Then the woman contestant does a strip. Then the man does.
Presumably on the basis of artistic impression, length of strip and amount
of exposure (all the way...) they then win what looks like BIG MONEY.
Except that with 2000+ Lire to the pound sterling, even a million lire is
only 500 quid /$1,000 - small potatoes by the standard prizes of most US/UK
game shows. Did I mention the hotel is opposite a cinema showing a film of
some name or other which appears to have a woman in it with large breasts
and a star on each nipple? No? Just as well.

Another program I caught was "Singin' in the Rain" in Italian.
Doo-be-doo-doo, doo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo etc translates quite well....

Late on into the night on Telesat, there's the juvenile porno films so
often found in US hotels for $2/hour or whatever. CNN come on the air here
at 3:30 until 7:30, when last nights CBS Evening News is shown.

All of which drove me out onto the roads to have an early morning run every
day so far. I never had so much respect for orienteers as now. How they
avoid running into trees I have no idea. navigating my way around Varese
via a map from the hotel and looking where I'm going too, is somewhat, er,
difficult. Yesterday I ran off the edge of the map. Finding my way back was
somewhat easy, I'm not sure, but I think I ran in on the hard shoulder of a
highway - several Police cars went by and I didn't get nicked though.

So far I'm the only runner I've seen. I expected to get strange looks as a
result, but obviously the locals have all seen men in yellow tights running
around at 6 in the morning before - not a strange look have I encountered.
Hashers heaven however - the bars are open for boozing even at that hour.

If I don't make it home, one reason may be the drivers. On my way up to
Varese from Milan (a 90 minute journey) I saw two fatal accidents and one
breakdown in the outer lane with the guy changing a tyre right there...
Traffic lights are advisory only and I've yet to see anybody heed the
advice.

When I arrived on Sunday, I went walkies around the town. The weather was
warm and sunny and, although the men were dressed in suit and tie, the
women wore absolutely bugger all. The fashion seems to be for hot pants and
long legs. Certainly you could hear some hot pants from me as I looked at
them wandering by. I'm buying some for Wendy, but may insist she only wears
them in the privacy of our home...

Damn expensive place too. I was pretty amazed to find that a cheap lunch is
up to 25000 lire - more than 10 quid/$20. I have this horrible idea that
DEC may have the notion that I'm meant to bear the brunt of this...

Anyhow, it's all fun and a new experience.

I used to hang around with the Yale Precision Marching Band sometimes (the
band that puts the Rock back into Rachmaninoff).  Among their various
stunts was a small repetoire of tasteful football cheers.

For those lovely occasions when adversity triumphs:

W-E  S-U-C-K, We Suck! We Know It!

For the referees, and their guide dogs (sung to the tune of "Clementine")_

Who's your father, who's your father, who's your father, referee?
You ain't got one, you ain't got one, you're a bastard, referee....

(Heard in the stands during one Yale-Harvard game:  "Gee, that was a
real who's-your-father calll!")

And a few others:

Seduce 'em! Seduce 'em!  Lay 'em all over the field!

Here's to the Sun God!  He's the only One God!  Ra, Ra, Ra!

Gimme an "S"!  Gimme a "U"!  Gimme a "C"!  Gimme a "K"!  Gimme another "S"!

What's that spell?  SUCKS!  Who sucks?  Harvard Sucks?  What?  Dead Goats!
How?  Incestuously!  At which point, everyone starts screaming
Harvard Sucks Dead Goats!  -- ya hadda be there....

The YPMB was the only marching band I knew that play the theme from
Mighty Mouse, Ride of the Valkeries, Scheherazade (a miked Stradivarius
on the 50 yard line), and The Stripper.  They had a crazy kind of class.
And a tamborine section, and a prop crew and a selection of "appogiaturas",
folks playing stuffed bananas, juggling, blowing across beer bottles
and being otherwise Divinely Inspired.

There is some disagreement as to how to use the word 'optimal'.
All the following 'optimal' phrases were actually heard at the
"The Third Symposium on the Frontiers of Massively Parallel Computation".
We have not actually figured out the most optimal use of the word 'optimal'.

Using optimal:

                                optimal
                          near  optimal
                          more  optimal
                          most  optimal
                         quite  optimal
                          less  optimal
                          semi  optimal
                         quasi  optimal
                      (not) so  optimal
                     optimally  optimal
                      not very  optimal
                      somewhat  optimal
                 in some sense  optimal
        provable in some sense  optimal
                 optimal in an  optimal lower bound sense
                                optimalish
                                optimally fast
                                optimally effective

A few of our creations:

                      way more  optimal
                     perfectly  optimal
    (with vigorous handwaving)  optimal
      it just doesn't get more  optimal than this

Webster's has this to say:

"optimal: adj., most desirable or satisfactory."

"Every one has a User Support Story"

In a past professional life I worked for an Executive Education firm, you
know, one that demystifies the computer for upper-level, Fortune 150 types.
Mostly showing them how to avoid trouble in DOS, build some models in Lotus
1-2-3, and concentrating on what they need to know to last about 3 minutes
in a casual, cocktail party, computer related conversation, leaving it  up
to them to steer the conversation away from computers after a few well
rehearsed techno-jargon-gems delivered with knowing authority.

Anyway, keyboard skills for some were a real problem, and then some others
followed every instruction to the letter, sometimes eschewing common sense.

We used an intro program to help break the ice and give them a warm fuzzy
right from the start.  It asked them to answer a few y/n questions and hit
the Enter key, "the key with the downward, backward pointing arrow with the
elbow".  One sunny day I was watching over the room full of execs. having
fun when what to my eyes I should see but on of the participants leaning
forward over the keyboard, right arm cocked straight up in the air, trying
to hit only the enter key with his elbow.  The good news is that after
mastering this contortionists feat, we let him know that more conventional
methods for striking the enter key would produce similar results.

Makes you wonder, or does it....

I once watched through a one-way glass as a novice user was trying out a mail
system.  He'd composed his letter and was ready to send it.  He pressed
Ctrl and nothing happened.  He pressed Shift and still nothing happened.
He finally found the S and pressed that and away went his mail.  For the
rest of the session he loyally pressed Ctrl-Shift-S every time he wanted to
send something.

$3.50/issue or $23/year (8 issues) -- or send something to review

Mike and his co-editors will review nearly anything that is sent to
them (videos, music, art, catalogs, software, games, T-shirts,
calendars, poetry), but the bulk of each issue is taken up with reviews
of around 1000 different magazines.  These include a few slick
commercial items, but the slant is to alternative viewpoints (artistic,
sexual, political, musical, and just hobbies).  Some of my favorite
reviews from one recent issue:

The 4-Square Mag: "Yes, it's serious, an entire zine dedicated to the
playground sport of four-square. ..."

American Window Cleaner: "The professional journal for window washers
continues to put out excellent issues.  This one will tell you how to
make a better working squeegee, show a method for climbing up the rope
if you work with a bosun's chair, and go into the physics of soap films.
Lots of short ads and product announcements help the window cleaner keep
an edge over the competition."

Cichlidae Communique: "Cichlids are a particular type of fish, and this
is for people who breed and raise them.  I learned all sorts of
things...  Whether I needed to know any of this is another matter, but
the photos are nice and the articles are well-done and even amusing on
occasion."

Condo Mondo: "Nancy sent along this single-page newsletter she does for
her condo association and asks if we'll review such things.  Well, sure,
why not? ... Possibly of purely local interest."

The Insider Gun News: "... #8 has a story on selecting a new handgun for
NY City cops listing three important considerations: (1) NYCPD cops are
not good at cleaning their guns (2) Their marksmanship is not so hot
either and (3) The bullets should be easily traced back to a particular
gun after firing, say the crime lab folks."

The Joe News: "...Who is Joe?  Why does he have a zine named after him?
Darned if I know.  Hipness oozes out of the writing here, along with
such dubious substances as Burl Ives."

The News of the Watchmen: "Apocalyptic update on how world Zionism,
Freemasonry and the Baal Priesthood of Rome, armed with secret
reality-altering magnetic weapons, are preparing to take over the world.
There's a personal note too--the author's struggles with the tyrants of
the Communist Democratic/Beast System from his 18 foot trailer mobile
HQ.  Calculations of the world's end-date (1994-5) based on counting
sabbatical years, make this an outstanding value.  ... Close call here:
the mission had almost run out of gas, but God provided a large number
of empty beer cans which could be returned."

No Mayo News: "A newsletter for people who really REALLY hate 'the white
slime.'  This ish addresses the perils of 'ranch' flavoring and 'special
sauce'--nothing but mayo in drag--and gives recipes for Mayo-free tuna
and potato salad.  Apparently in earnest, though quite arch."

Notes from the Dump: "Yup, Terry really does work at the dump, and when
he's not working he ruminates about life.  You never know what you'll
find here: quotes from Shakespeara and Goethe, the latest medical update
on residents of Acworth and Langdon, fast motorcycles (#74 inquires into
the first names of Messrs. Harley and Davidson) and slow days.  Great fun."

The Optimistic Pezzimist: "The only zine there is for collectors of Pez
dispensers and related ephemera. ..."

Sasquatch (pub. by the Prime Minister of Livestock and Heavy Machinery):
"If the name of the publisher hasn't already tipped you off, this is a
weird one.  The Prime Minister writes of nihilistic egoism and strange
metaphysical pigs and other deranged things.  Nice silly touches
throughout, culminating in the diode binding."

"On the Street with Crad Kilodney vol. 2": "Crad K. sells his books on
the sidewalks of Toronto.  He also carries a tape recorder...In [this
tape], he gets assaulted both physically and verbally, held spellbound
by a crazy Anarchist boxer, harassed by passers by, and otherwise
interacts with the street scene.  Amusing, frightening, and more than a
bit funny."

As the above should make clear, the reviews are worth reading for the
editors' droll sense of humor, if nothing else, but chances are
excellent that you'll find a few magazines listed here that you want to
subscribe to, too.  To mention just two publications that have been
featured in Desperado recently, there's The Funny Times and The Chicken
Boy Catalog for a Perfect World.

To be fair, though, I should point out that the above is *not* a
representative sample of what's reviewed.  Mike has deep roots in the
Science Fiction, APA, Anarchist, and other movements; there's also a
lot here on home schooling, and lots of punk music and zines.  The
literary magazines have been increasing lately, too.  And if Desperado
was on paper, I suspect it would get a favorable review.

If any of these names are familiar, you'll find several zines with
things either by or about them:  G.G. Allin, "Bob", Ace Backwords,
Whiteboy, tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE, The Church of Tina, Joe E., Bob
Black.  If you can identify more than a couple of these, you should be
sending your zine to Mike for review.  It's only fair to warn you,
though, that Jesse Helms would be very offended, not only by many of
the publications reviewed, but probably by FF itself.

Complete ordering information is provided for all items reviewed.  I
should also mention the copyright policy: except for the columns and

This morning's (28-Jan-1991) Boston Globe brings the following, buried back
with the obituaries:

LONDON PAPER SETS MOZART DATE RIGHT

LONDON - A British newspaper corrected yesterday its report from nearly two
centuries ago on the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The Observer said that on Dec. 25, 1791, it reported "the celebrated German
composer" Mozart had died 10 days earlier in Vienna.

"We are now able to confirm that the composer died on Dec. 5 and was, in
fact, Austrian.  As today is his birthday, we should like to take this
opportunity to apologize to the composer's family for any distress," the
weekly said.

Referring to The Times of London, the Observer added:  "We should like to
point out that news traveled more slowly in those days and the previous
day's Times committed the same error."  (AP)

Well. I'm glad *that's* finally settled.

Hi Tom,

Thought  you might be interested in the following bit of programming folklore:

 So you want to learn a new programming language?  There are only four things
you need to find out:

        - What does a semicolon do?

        - Are vector indexes zero- or one-based?

        - How is a compound statement formed?

        - Does it have macros?

If the answer to the last question is no,  forget it.

Clearly, ye perfons who suppofedly tranfcribed ye purported Bible
pafsage do not know ye rules for ufing ye two forms of ye letter `s'
yat exifted at ye time Bilton and Scaggs are fuppofed originally to
have publifhed ye fuppofed Buggre Alle Yis Bible.  So here, for ye
general edification, are yofe rules:

1.  Ye two forms of ye letter, in modern typography, are reprefented
    by ufing an `f' and an `s'.

2.  Ye firft form, ye `f', is ufed exclufively at ye beginning and in
    ye middle of a word.  It never appears at ye end of a word unlefs
    it is being ufed as ye letter `f', as in "Bread is ye ftaff of
    life."

3.  Ye fecond form, ye `s', is always ufed at ye end of a word, as in
    "He is a filly afs."

4.  Ye fecond form is never ufed at the beginning or in ye middle of a
    word unlefs yere are two occurrences of ye letter togeyer, as in
    "pafsel of fillinefs."  In yis exception cafe, ye `s' is ufed as ye
    fecond letter of ye pair.

Sharp-eyed readers will immediately notice a fufficient number of
incorrect ufages in the fuppofed Bible pafsage as to make one wonder at
the authenticity of faid Bible excerpt.

Further fharp-eyed readers will notice ye ufe in ye prefent
difsertation of `Y' and `y' to reprefent fome occurrences of `Th' and
`th' refpectively.  Thefe latter forms are modern reprefentations are
of ye obfolete letter called a thorn, and pronounced as a foft `th', or
more properly a `dh', and not as a `y'.   Ye fact that yere are no
inftances of a thorn in ye purported Bible text, defpite the modern
fafcination with calling purveyors of ufelefs objects names like "Ye
Olde Englishe Gifte Shoppe," gives further caufe to wonder whether we
are being had.

Here's an interesting one:

Microsoft Word 4.0's spell-check dictionary doesn't recognize the word
"childcare".  Instead is suggests the word "kidnapper"!  How can this be?
My understanding/experience with spell checkers is that they usually
select alternatives that are phonetically related or anagrammatic (ie,
reveresed letters).

Is this just a cruel joke put forth by the spell-check authors, or what?

Subj:   symbology becomes PCthink becomes physiology

   I assume everyone understands that providing numerically equal restroom
   facilities for men and women is tantamount to providing unequal facilities
   for  women.  Sort of like the reverse of the life-insurance problem, but
   more immediate.

No, I do not understand.

Please explain to us how providing numerically equal restrooms for
both sexes results in huge lines for the Ladies room.

Your reply, of course, will center, nay hinge, upon differences
between the male and female physiologies.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The fact, physiologically speaking, is that while the gentleman's wedding
tackle is located outboard, the lady, who has much more of such equipment,
has it all tucked inside her, leaving less room for the bladder.  Didn't
your Dad go over this with you?

Perhaps this next item will help.  Delicate readers are advised to tiptoe
cautiously around this. (Note to the author:  Dennis, you'll see I

Subj:   Women's rest rooms

I don't remember all the facts, so I don't remember if this was
enacted into law, or just proposed, but I think it was in Virginia
that all new rest room facilities have to be provided on a
numerically equal basis, and I remember some city (New York?)
arguing for a 2-1 ratio (obviously in favor of the women).

Whenever this subject comes up, and it always seems to at sports
events and amusement parks, I ask the women whether they'd be
willing to have their rest rooms outfitted with new toilets of my
own design:  There's a row of these standard porcelain bowls,
separated by partitions.  There aren't any tanks associated with the
bowls, and no place to sit down.  They're far enough out from the
wall that you can easily remove or reposition whatever garments you
feel deserve said treatment before use.  There aren't any doors, just
these partitions which should provide more than enough privacy.  It
doesn't really matter if you miss the because there will probably be
someone in to mop the floor in a day or so.  No takers yet.

What I really want to know is how the the legislators determine how
many fixtures in the Ladies' room correspond to each of the
following:

+ The "urinal wall," commonly found in Men's rooms in Fenway, in
which there are no urinals, just a sloping wall with a trough at the
bottom.

+ The circular urinal, which I'll have trouble describing but those
of you who've seen them will know exactly what I mean.  It's sort of
like a giant stainless-steel orange juicer about 5 feet in diameter.
Men stand around it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
In other words, would women put up with what men put up with in the public
john department?  Probably not.  If you want clean restroom, try Norway,
which has the best I've ever used.

I was driving home the other day behind a Massachusetts redneck's9 pickup

The first was a recently lettered home-made one which said:

        Taxachussets:  Where anything is FEEsable.

9 Massachusetts Redneck:  Any good redneck has a pickup truck with a rack
in the rear window.  Good rednecks carry a gun in the rack.  Guns are illegal
in Mass., so you carry (depending on the time of year) a 4 foot carpenter's

This was written by a field-service guy named Dan (SMOGGY::) Silva who

    Rap:  I don't get it at all.  Just program the synthesizers, and
    talk into the mic.  Most "songs" (what do you call them, poems?)
    are about the singer him(her)self, and how good they are at rappin'.
    One (I forget who) even compares himself to Jesus Christ!  Someone
    once said to me that we could get together, program a synthesizer,
    and read text from a service manual (that is, "rap" it) and make
    money!  (He's probably right.)  I also don't get all the names that
    sound alike (MC DJ T D... combine these initials or letters, and
    maybe add the word "Ice" or "Fresh" or "Cool")

    Manufactured product that simulates an actual artist or group. (Millie
    Vanilli)  This product was surely the brain child of some marketing
    exec's trying to create a product that would sell.  Find an individual
    or group of individuals who have a certain look that might make money.
    Provide musicians to perform the music, or try to train the "artist" to
    perform their own.  This isn't art, it's manufacturing/marketing.
    These exec's might as well be trying to market a new cola.

    Madonna:  Another marketing phenomenon.  Combining religious symbolism
    with sex.  A guaranteed sell, no matter what the level of talent.
    Too bad she lip sync's her music (which does nothing for me.)
    Apparently, it *is* her that does the singing, but it's in the studio,
    and gets fixed up before she lip syncs it.

    Well, that's about all I can think of right now.  Now if you'll excuse
    me, I've got to go make a recording.  I'm rappin' the RA90 Pocket
    Reference Guide.  (It'll be Millie Vanilli on the cover, tho'.)

    Yo! Listen up, if you're fixin' RA90's

    Examine and analyze VAXsim PLUS
    And make sure everything's cool on the Bus

(This alledgedly really happened in Canada.  I heard it from a
friend.  After posting it in rec.backcountry I got some requests to
post it here.)

Some guy on drugs jumped over a cliff but did not quite succeed in
killing himself.  The rescue team tied his unconscious body into a
Stokes litter and proceeded to evacuate by means of a "fixed line
flyaway."  This means that the litter is suspended a couple of
hundred feet below a helicopter which then flies to a level place
where they can set him down (carefully) and either load him in the
aircraft or otherwise take further care of him.  The patient is
accompanied by one attendant tied into the litter.

This patient began to regain consciousness during the flight.
Remember he is flying across the sky and being marginally conscious
(as well as probably still feeling the effects of whatever drug he
took) probably doesn't notice either the helicopter or the cable
attaching him to it.  The attendant, who happens to have a nice
bushy beard, notices that the patient is starting to "come around"
and in an effort to keep him calm says in his most soothing voice:

     Don't worry, I'll take care of you.  My name is Peter.

The effect was somewhat less soothing than hoped for and the
attendant decided that next time he would use a name other than
Peter.

LPS newsservice....The government, in a rare cooperative effort with the
nation's largest companies, announced its plans for pulling the country out
of the current 'significant downturn', before it gets further out of hand.
A spokesperson who spoke on the condition of anonymity was quoted as
saying: "We simply cannot leave a legacy to our grandchildren of having to
sit through endless years of horror stories about the great depression such
as we were subject to. I hated it from my grandparents, and I'll spare my
great grandchildren, or my name isn't Henry Farquar Goiosbaining IV."

The villain it seems, has been a reluctance of the consumer to take on
extra debt, which finances economic expansion. A sure sign of economic
retraction has been a loss of faith in the future, and the attendant worry
about making ends meet.

To counter this negative behavior, officials at the highest levels have
unveiled an unprecedented series of new charges and fee hikes which will
insure that citizens at all economic levels will have to finance day to day
expenses just to remain where they are. The new tax and fee programs are
expected to generate $15 billion in government revenue, but will cost
upwards of $200 billion to administer. "It's our way of setting an example"
says the spokesperson.

Large corporations have jumped on the new order bandwagon, with one
prominent technological corporation proposing to halve the number of times
it will disburse funds to its employees. "We'll do our utmost to see that
none of our employees will be able to live without doing his patriotic
duty" says a highly placed source within the company.

Reaction from Wall street was mixed, as most floor traders, unable to come
up with the new parking, entrance, telephone and restroom fees, spent the
day arranging new lines of credit for themselves.

Subj:   SRL?

I read with, uh, interest I guess, the account of the SRL show in Barcelona
that you provided to Desperado.  Are video tapes of these things available?
How can one get more details about the May show in San Francisco (e.g.,
specifically where and when)?

I don't know, len.  A little bird told me I may get a chance to see some

   Reported on radio station WZZ0, 95.1 FM, Bethlehem-Allentown, PA,
this morning.

   A woman reported her car stolen, advised the police that it was
equipped with a cell phone, and gave them the phone number for it.

   Police officer called the car, and lo and behold the thief
answered. Cop says "I hear you've got a car you want to get rid of..."
Thief and cop haggle on price, etc. for a while. Finally cop tells
thief he'd really like to see the car. A meeting place is established,
and when the cops show up, there's the thief, leaning against the
fender, arms crossed, waiting for his "buyer".

                     WELL, KING, THIS CASE IS CLOSED

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Well, here goes another one, not quite like the other one, and it's
        not even Friday afternoon.  This one has a certain sang-froid, for
        some reason.  They all have sang-froid, but they don't all have a
        certain sang-froid.  And some embody other knowing French
        expressions, which I can't spell either.

        Not only was there no gas rationing mentioned during the Great Gulf
        War (which I trust is well and truly over), there was no mention of
        issuing war bonds either.  And those invisible Iraqi casualties
        seem to have been in WWI proportions.

        But, it's almost spring.
