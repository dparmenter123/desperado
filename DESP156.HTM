I feel a certain compunction in including the first little news item
below. The item itself made me howl like a dog, but then my cautious
nature asserted itself. Would its inclusion inspire dozens of contributions
of limericks better left to the imagination?  Would I at long last find
out more about the hermit named Dave? But then I remembered the DELETE
command in MAIL, and decided to include the following economics lesson:

Subj:   A lesson in economics

A friend (Peter Pauling) in England sent this to me.  An illustration of
economic theory.

        A tired young trollop of Nome
        Was worn out from her toes to her dome.
                Eight miners came screwing
                But she said,  "Nothing doing,
        One of you has to go home."

This and the following limerick were often quoted by Professor
Schumpeter (the famous economist (ed)) to illustrate two basic
principle of economic theory.  The above poem illustrates
"marginal utility."  The said trollop carefully assesses the benefit
to be derived from the eighth miner against the marginal cost to
herself.  Cost and benefit curves intersect at the seventh miner.
The eighth miner, had he known, could have upped the price, but
        a) none knew who the eighth was, and
        b) he would have been most unpopular with the other seven.

In the event, all eight miners went home as an expression of 'solidarity' -
a factor unknown to marginal utility theory.

"The Law of Diminishing Returns" is illustrated by:

        A persistent old Harvard professor
        Tried once more with a whore from Odessa.
                She applied all her arts
                To his genital parts,
        But they only grew lesser and lesser.

The latest issue of Desperado made mention of the island of Montserrat.
We also just returned from that warm haven, and I urge you to not
spread the word any further! We loved the island, thought the people
were absolutely great (warm, friendly, etc.), and had eight of the
best days in a villa overlooking the ocean. Did not miss one single
sunset, sitting watching the sun set over the ocean with a cold beer
firmly in hand. Sailing, snorkeling, swimming, lots of eating. Ahhhh....

But one of the beauties of the place is that there are few other touristas
there. Which leaves us with a mini-moral dilemma. Should we tell our friends,
who in turn will tell others, about Montserrat, and then turn this
paradise into yet another island full of us ugly Americans, or should
we lie when asked about the island and say that it's just like the
"other" Emerald Isle in the winter - cold, rainy and dreary?

Subj:   On interactive toys

From:   FIZBIN::BINDER "It spreads like butter..."
To:     NINA
Subj:   FYAmusement

My local newspaper recently ran an article about the wonders of computer
science as applied to the latest big-bucks scheme in the toy business, namely
those fancy hi-tech marvels called interactive toys.  Interactive is a
buzzword that means, "You talk to me, and I'll give you syntax errors in
return."  Syntax is a buzzword that means - oh, no, that's another article.
Anyway, these cute little critters behave almost like fancy real live
critters.  They carry fancy price tags, too, I'll have you know.  The dumbest
ones will set you back about a week's groceries.

These darling little interactive baby beasts and baby people, and any other
objects that can be made in the right shape to have an entire IBM computer in
their innards, react to their surroundings.  Wave at one, and it'll blink.
Talk to one and it'll talk back.  Actually, it won't talk back.  It will say
something that an ingenious computer wizard programmed it to say.  Or it'll
gurgle or say whatever else it is that babies say.  Yell at one and it'll wet
its pants and cry.  Or if it's a darling baby bear it will bite you on the
ankle.

But I'm not here today to talk about charming, helpless baby things.  I have a
message.  A real important message, which everyone ought to read and copy and
post everywhere that you can stick a Post-it memo pad page.  And that message
is this:  The next step in interactive toys, according to the article in my
local newspaper, is interactive toys that watch TV.  That's right, they watch
television.  And they're just like real people.  They even have their own
favorite programs.  When their favorite programs come on, they do just like
the people on the TV do - they shoot each other and blow each other to
smithereens.  If you should happen to be standing between two of these
charming little creatures when they go on one of their murderous rampages, all
I can say is heaven help you.

Now of course you wouldn't be caught dead standing between two of these
delightful toys, would you?  But what about your dog?  I propose a massive
letter writing campaign. Send hundreds of nasty letters to all the toymakers
you know, and tell them that if their toys blow your dog to smithereens you'll
sue.  Or if that's too dire a threat, tell them that the least they can do is
include a tube of super glue with each toy so you can try to put enough of
your dog back together to impress a jury.

with decorative Japanese calligraphy:

A woman found a handsome Chinese medallion in an antique shop, decorated
with elegant Chinese characters.  She bought it and, soon after, wore it
to a dinner party.  Seated across from her was an elderly Chinese
gentleman.  As the dinner progressed, she noticed that he seemed to find
something very amusing about her.  After the dinner, she asked him what
was so funny, but he just smiled and wouldn't answer.  Later, she found out
that the inscription on the medallion read:

I think there is probably a name for the rhetorical quandary in which I find
myself. I did the wrong thing acting from a correct principle. I included in
the last issue a limerick illustrative of an economic principle. For reasons
of my own, which is the only editorial guideline I've got, I find marginal
utility very funny, and I thought the economic discussion overshadowed the
dubious limerick. I included the sucker. Several people sent me
thoughtful and kindly messages like the following:

         Just a note of caution - I'm sure you've seen the most recent
         New Hampshire View with its article on the new systems policy,
         "Proper Use of Digital Computers".  One of the things outlawed
         is "transmitting sexual...slurs or jokes", into which category
         I'm afraid your limericks fall.  Although the economic theory
         was interesting, I didn't personally think the limericks were
         all that funny even - but personal taste (for which there's no
         accounting - ouch, sorry) aside, I would hate to see a fine rag
         like Desperado bite the dust over a few no-account limericks!  :-)

and my personal favorite:

        Comment re limerick comments:  Now that we have an official
        computer usage policy, I think the limericks open up Desperado
        for possible actional offense.  Would advise not sending
        off-color or double entendre items.

        But, what can you buy for 2 cents anymore!

It offended one person who sent a series of furious messages that
included a threat to bring in Corporate Personnel. Corporate Personnel,
I'll trouble you! I talked with this person and defused the threat
with a request that we handle this issue a la Desperado -- that is, the
person should send me an amusing message on the subject, and I'd include
it in this issue, if I thought it was funny at the time. In my usual calm
and restrained manner, I talked to chums over lunch about this whole flap,
and attracted the attention of the Vogon News Service with the following
letter, edited for reasons of space and because I know you want me to
get to the funny stuff:
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
From:   2491::BINDER "Put it on my tab."
To:     DESPERADO

A letter I wrote to the VOGON News Service about the limericks in Desperado
#1144 got published. For those who aren't also VNS subscribers, here's the
verbatim text of that letter:

        Sir,

        There is in Digital an ad-hoc publication of amusing anecdotes,
        chit-chat and general foofaraw called Desperado.  It's been a vital
        part of the DEC culture for several years.  One of the charms of
        Desperado is that its contents are chosen in a manner that is, to
        quote its founder, "entirely high-hat."  What appeals to the editor on
        a given day goes in.

        Heard at lunch today:  Someone has threatened to turn Desperado in to
        Big Brother for having published two "sexist" limericks.

        This threat is yet another sign that the Familiars of the Spanish
        Inquisition and the religious leaders of 17th-century Salem Village
        are still with us, at least in spirit.  Right alongside them, scowling
        fiercely in self-righteous anger, stands the late Senator Joseph
        McCarthy.

        But the way to suppress wickedness of which one disapproves remains
        unchanged: search diligently for it, root it out wherever it is
        hiding.  Assume the worst, lest you miss something.  When you have
        found evil, be it real or imagined, proudly hold it up for all to see,
        condemn it to death, and say, "What a good boy --oops, person-- am
        I!".

        To quote the Bible out of context:  "Seek and ye shall find."  If you
        want to be offended, it's easy; the veriest child can do it.
        Knee-jerk reaction requires no thought.  The maturity to dismiss minor
        affronts is harder to develop.

        Yrs,
        Dick Binder

Now then, the amusing part of this is that since my letter hit the
VNS newsstand I have received no less than twelve mail messages from other VNS
readers.  They all looked similar to this one:

        Dick, would you mind telling me how to get on the "Desperado" mailing
        list?  We could use some "high hat" humour in snows of Colorado, as
        well as a little sexist bandy, heavens!!!
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
So, welcome to Desperado, VNSniks, and for heaven's sake, people, lighten up.

Note 96.0                My favorite repair story                 4 replies
WHYVAX::HETRICK "Brian Hetrick"                 48 lines   2-MAR-1987 17:26
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have to tell my favorite hardware repair story.

          In another life, I worked for a Massachusetts based US-wide
     retail chain.  They always had the latest and greatest IBM machines.
     They always got the first of anything off the production line -- as a
     result, what they got was often rather flakey, since the first one or
     two of anything are always learning experiences for the production
     crew, even for IBM.

          The IBM 370 model 168 this company had was relatively unreliable
     -- it would crash every day or two.  The local CEs (FS types to us
     Digits) couldn't find out what was wrong.  The regional CEs couldn't
     find out what was wrong.  The national CEs couldn't find out what was
     wrong.  The Model 168 tiger team couldn't find out what was wrong.
     By the time all these folk had poked around in the machine's innards,
     the people owning the machine were getting pretty fed up.  So, IBM
     called in -- The Designer, called in from his vacation in Europe.  The
     Model 168 tiger team is carefully neutral about whether this is
     advisable, in marked contrast to IBM's usual attitude that whatever
     they's going to do is *just* what you need.

          [Now, I don't know if this guy actually had anything to do with
     the Model 168 design.  But I sure hope so, 'cause if he didn't, they
     took an awful chance.]

          Came the day The Designer is to look at the machine.  In through
     the machine room door comes this *huge* man -- at least 6 1/2 feet
     tall, 4 feet wide, 350 pounds if he was an ounce, and none of it slack
     bellied.  He's wearing white buckskin with 2 foot long fringes along
     the arms and legs.  He stalks -- that's the only word for it -- over
     to the console, and sits down.  He watches the video display intently
     while manipulating the various dials and switches on the auxiliary
     console on his left, and flipping the multi-mode flashing lights
     display between several modes.  After no more than three minutes of
     this going on, in total silence, he stalks over to one of the cabinets
     -- pulls the door open -- open the card cage cover -- grabs one of the
     boards -- pulls it out [the machine is live, mind you] -- and
     *crushes* it in his bare hands.  He then stalks out, without having
     ever said a word.

          After we picked the CSs up off the floor, they power down the
     machine, replace the 18 inch by 24 inch, multi-layer board this hulk
     has just reduced to fiberglass splinters, and power the machine back
     up.

          No problem, then or since.

I received the attached on the TOPS-20 mailing list, and thought that it
might tickle the fancies of REC.MUSIC.FOLK readers.  There's no indication
of any particular music it could/should be sung to, but it scans pretty
nicely, and there are many songs with a "limerick" scansion.

                        VAXOLOGY

There is a computer named VAX,
Which is totally loaded with hacks,
   But the real piece of crap
   Is the overflow trap,
Which an old-PC register lacks.

It's got byte-string instructions galore,
But the packed decimal format is poor,
   And the halfword length means
   That it isn't worth beans,
Just like the 360's of yore.

Oh, the branch mnemonics are losing,
And the right to left numbers confusing,
   But the thing that's a pain,
   An efficiency drain,
Is the miniscule page size they're using.

Well, they give you lots of good stuff,
And the address space size is enough,
   But you can't do an "exch",
   And it makes you say "bletch",
When you see all the RSX cruft.

I got a very entertaining addendum to my home insurance policy recently,
and wanted to share it so others might realize the risks they're running
of being under-insured in case of a catastrophe.

The amendment was to the coverage for personal property, and lists the
following exclusions:

        o items of rarity or antiquity that cannot be replaced;

        o articles whose age or history contributes substantially to
          their value. These include, but are not limited to,
          memorabilia, souvenirs and collectors' items;

        o motorized golf carts and their equipment and accessories.

So, if any of the readership owns a Gutenberg Bible or a golf-cart cover,
be warned...

        Just came back from a meeting with Ed.  Seems "The Washington Times"
        has found out about the profits from the Iran arms sales.  Ed thinks
        that if TWT found out about this, well, it won't be long before
        the media vultures get wind.  TWT is responsible enough not to
        run with a story that hurts this wonderful nation of ours.

        So, we're going to fallback strategy.  Poindexter will resign.
        I'll be fired.  RR is pissed, but wants us to stonewall until we
        get a go sign from him.  Nobody, I repeat nobody, is to talk about
        anything until it's cleared with Regan.

        Most important, we've got to make sure we leave no trails.
        Meese has made arrangements that I'll "accidently" have access
        to my office after I resign.  So, I'll be destroying what little
        paper trail we've left.

        BTW, I've still got a tempest and secure modem at home.  So, I'll
        be talking to you.

 A toilet paper company has come up with a way to keep campers from
catching a rear end full of buckshot. They're selling camouflaged
toilet paper to use in the woods. Jim Carlberg of Innovative Paper
Products says it's not unusual for trigger-happy hunters to mistake a
"busy" camper for a white-tailed deer. That's why his company is
manufacturing toilet paper in a wide variety of colors other than
white. Campers can purchase toilet paper in shades such as "Don't
Shoot" orange, greens and browns!

                             One Day At the Coffee Pot

            Last Tuesday I began my morning in the usual way, by
            sauntering over to the coffee pot to get my first caffeine
            hit of the day.  The scene at the coffee area was, however,
            anything but usual.  To my amazement, there knelt none other
            than Desperado's own Therry Neilsen-Steinhardt, up to her elbows
            in coffee grounds, poring through the garbage barrel.
            My inquisitiveness got the better of me and I inquired about
            her situation.  Apparently, she had discovered the trick of
            removing the nozzle from the coffee maker when running a pot
            of hot water for tea so that the water would be ready in 30
            seconds instead of the 4 minutes it takes when running the
            water through the nozzle and a filter.  In doing so, she
            managed to lose the nozzle and had presumed that she had
            accidentally tossed it into the garbage.  Hence,  her
            frantic search through old grounds and wet, shredding
            filters.  Being somewhat perverse, I couldn't help teasing
            poor Ms N-S, and threatened to submit the incident to
            Desperado.  Amidst a glowing blush she said that
            if I wrote it, she was mature enough to print it and take
            her licks.  So, if you are reading this, I guess the proof
            is in the printing.  Congratulations Therry for being a good
            sport.

            Oh, by the way, after searching through all the grimy
            grounds and other assorted yuck, she did find the nozzle...on the
            floor next to the sink, nowhere near the garbage can.  Can we
            draw a conclusion about life from this?

from a Sex Pistols song that won't get me in trouble with Corporate Personnel.
It's for a Desperado header."

&gt;From the Boston Globe, Feb 25, 1987, page 2:

Imagine the Lawrence Welk fans who bought his new "Polka Party"
compact disc and got the hard-driving punk rock soundtrack to the
movie "Sid and Nancy". Welk Enterprises found the wrong labels were
put on the discs at a factory in Japan when they started getting calls
from women so shocked by the language on the record "they couldn't
repeat it," said Welk spokesperson Bernice McGeehan. The movie is
about former Sex Pistols member Sid Vicious, who died of a heroin
overdose before he could be tried for the murder of his girlfriend,
Nancy Spungen.
