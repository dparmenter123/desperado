The DIGITAL Dictionary Committee is seeking technical terms and definitions for
the Second Edition, to be published soon. If you have terms and definitions, or
know sources of such terms, that are not in the First Edition and are likely
additions to the Dictionary, please contact Bob Marotta, Dictionary Chairperson,
at RAINBW::MAROTTA.

The Dictionary is available on-line (as well as in hardcopy, from DIGITAL Press)
if you wish to check terms that are in the First Edition. The on-line version is
available through the Tools Clearinghouse.  (See METOO""::TOOLS$LIBRARY:
GLOSSARY.LIS for more details.)

Feel free to pass this message along to anyone who may represent a group that
would like product-specific technical terms added to the Dictionary.

Now this could be fun.  The First Edition of the Digital Dictionary
was undoubtedly tons of work, but there are some definite oddities
about it.  In the first place, the following terms are not defined:

        ALL-IN-1, COS-310, DATATRIEVE, DEC, DECdirect, DECmail,
        DECmate, DECnet, DECservice, DECsystem-10, DECSYSTEM-20,
        DECUS, DECwriter, Letter Printer 100, MASSBUS, PDP,
        Professional, Rainbow, RSX, UNIBUS, VAX, VMS, VT, Work
        Processor

Those terms, most of which are used in Dictionary definitions, come
from the list of trademarks that appears in the front of the DIGITAL
Dictionary.  The only items from the trademark list that are defined in the
Dictionary are:

        P/OS, RSTS, DIBOL

Defined in the Dictionary, but omitted from the trademark list:

        RT

There are some strange definitions in this book.

Here is the entire definition of abort:

        abort n.
        VAX/VMS

        An exception that occurs in the middle of an instruction and
        sometimes leave the registers and memory in an indeterminate
        state, such that the instruction cannot be restarted.
        See also exception.

Hmm.  Those VAX/VMSs are cranky, aren't they?

Here is the definition of ZAP:

        ZAP n.
        RSX-11M

        A utility used to catch task images.

Ah, I caught one of the little suckers!  Now what?

Some advice to writers from Section I, Readability/Translatability:

        Sometimes a writer switches terms within a single sentence or
        within a single paragraph.  The reader may be confused if a
        writer uses "CPU" one time, "computer" the next time, and
        "processor" another time.  The DIGITAL Dictionary is intended
        as a source for finding the "right term.  Once found, that
        term should be used consistently to refer to the same thing
        throughout a document.

Sound advice.  It turns out there's no definition for "CPU" or
"computer", and "processor" is defined as a VAX/DBMS program "similar
in function to a compiler . . . [that] lacks the size, scope and power
of a compiler."

O.K.

The Dictionary was apparently compiled from all those glossaries we've
been putting in our manuals the last few years.  I spotted quite a few
definitions from my glossaries, anyway. The dependence on specific
documentation leads to some other oddities.  For instance, "access
date" is defined as a TOPS-10 term for when a file was last accessed,
no doubt because the definition was gleaned from a TOPS-10 glossary.
So, we get the following identifications of terms:

        least significant bit-MINC,  procedure-VAX Datatrieve,  sequential
        record access-VAX/RMS,  server task-DECnet,  pad character-DECnet,
        pad-FMS,  nested conditional instruction-Terminal Display
        Management System,  named file-DECsystem-10,  lowercase-DECword,
        host system-VAX/VMS, addressing mode-VAX/VMS.

And since there was an excellent glossary in the RSX RMS documentation,
there are many, many words in the Dictionary that have something to do
with buckets.

There's an equally baffling set of terms identified as DIGITAL-specific:

        account name, ACP, allocation, application program, array,
        assigning a device, attribute, attribute character,
        auto-repeat, auto-wraparound, and auxiliary keypad.

And that's only the ones that start with A.

I wanted to see if "on-line" was "online" or "on-line".  It was listed
both ways, and identified as DIGITAL-specific to boot.

The Dictionary was funded by Ed Services and Central Quality.

Let's just accept the Dictionary as V1.0, where all the ducks are
gathered together, but it's time they were gotten in rows.  Everyone
who can should respond to the request for assistance.

Here is the epigraph of the Dictionary,

        The greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it
        has taken place.

How true!  How true!

Subj:   Encyclopedia Brit. and Cokesbury

I don't know if anyone has answered you on this one, but the reason the
Information Center (a.k.a. Library) in the Mill doesn't have the Macropedia/
Micropedia edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica in hard copy is because
it is available through Mead Data Central's database NEXIS.  It is searchable
full-text online (without charts or illustrations, unfortunately).  Thanks for
calling attention to the need for a sign over the old edition noting that
the latest edition is available online.
Incidentally, I searched for "Cokesbury" in the EB and came up zilch.
I did find a couple of references to Cokesbury College in the database
"America: History and Life."  It appears that Cokesbury College was founded
in 1784 as a Methodist college in Abingdon, Maryland, and was destroyed
by fire in 1795.  Still don't know where the actual word "Cokesbury"
originated (but the Oxford English dictionary gives it a definition of
a simple-minded fool, or one who is easily fooled. Sorry my modifier was
faulty; the word "cokes" is given the above definition, origin unkown, but
possibly derived from "Cockney."  I doubt that it has anything to do with
American Methodism, though.

I look forward to using the Encyclobrit on-line, but the lack of
pictures and diagrams and the difficulty of skimming and browsing make
me want to have a hard-copy edition around as well.  On "Cokesbury",
to reiterate, I'm pretty sure it's a portmanteau word from the first
two Methodist bishops, Coke and Asbury.

I'm interested in any information people have about uses of computer
technology by Central American governments.  I have a paper due
for a DP course and this is the topic I've chosen.

This summer I heard that the Guatemalan goverment is using computers
to monitor water supply usage.  The idea is if usage is
inappropriately high, then occupants may be harboring guerillas.

I've also read about AC-130 spy planes out of Panama and OV-1
Mohawks from Palmerola in Honduras overflying El Salvador 24 hours
a day.  According to U.S. officials, they map guerilla territory
with radar and infra-red computer analyzed photographs.

Finally, have read that info from CIA databases are made
available to government security forces.

Have just starting looking into the topic so I'm still somewhat
unfocused and my info is sketchy.  Would appreciate any input.

SGT. YORK CANNON FALLS SHORT DURING TEST IN N.M. DESERT

The Army's Sgt. York antiaircraft cannon yesterday fell short of duplicating
the sharp-shooting skill of it WWI namesake.

During a demonstration...the $6.8 million weapon required 60 shells to down
one remote-controlled helicopter.

Army officials, however, rated the demonstration a success, saying a civilian
unfamiliar with the weapon was at the controls....

Army officials have disputed as incomplete reports that the gun's radar con-
fused an actual target with an exhaust fan on a nearby outhouse earlier this
year. Officials said that the computer-operated detection system is so sensi-
tive that it was merely cognizant of the fan's movement and never zeroed in
nor aimed its guns on the outhouse.

        "At last - a kosher pig"

WASHINGTON - Animal husbandry researchers say they have
found a pig-like creature in the wilds of Indonesia that is
not only kosher but might make good eating for Jews and
Moslems, whose religions forbid eating port.
  A kosher pig?
  Because the tusked babirusa chews its cud and has a cloven
hoof, it would be considered edible by Moslems and Jews,
said Fuller Bazer, and animal husbandry professor at the
University of Florida who wants to visit a zoo on the island
of Java where 10 babirusa are in captivity.
  Although he has never heard of the babirusa, Rabbi Isaiah
Zeldin of the Stephen Wise Temple in Bel Air, Calif., said
that - based on its description - the creature would be
kosher.

Hi Tom,

Here in SHR we are attempting to use a DRV11-WA with a MICROVAX.  We are

candidate.

The DR11-W driver that is given in the "VMS Guide to Writing a Device Driver"
is only for machines with unibus adapters.

Here's the latest scam on the corporate smoking policy, cut down a
bit.  See the sender for a full length copy.

I am an ex-smoker.  I think the following:  No smoking in conference
rooms.  Every meeting longer than two hours has a smoking break.  Take
care of nonsmokers in office assignments, give them fans, do what
needs to be done.  Don't ostracize your fellow workers.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From:   INANNA::JFORTMILLER
To:     SYZYGY::SOPKA

A copy of the latest draft of the Smoking Policy has been discovered.
I personally am very disappointed with it, and will be sending
a memo directly to Ken Olsen today expressing briefly
my concerns, and requesting a meeting with him.

I believe the smoking problem, and our requests,  have been avoided by
upper management too long. This draft policy is even more watered down
than the previous draft that Personnel(Geoff Sackman)  put out.
It continues to leave it up to the nonsmokers to be the bad guys and speak up.

Notice that all the responsibility for deciding where smoking is allowed
is up to our facilities manager.  If your facility has a manager like
the one in my facility, we are in trouble.

Notice that the only forceful NO SMOKING is listed in the section on
protecting Digital's assets (computer equipment, etc -- not people!)

Here it is with a cover memo Geoff sent with it:

SUBJ: SMOKING POLICY FEEDBACK

Attached is the final draft of our proposed smoking policy.
The PMC asked that we have some organizational feedback
on how it is received.  As we discussed, would you, however you
choose, get a cross-sectional input of your employees
in as low key a way as possible.

                         SMOKING POLICY

While smoking is an individual choice, it is the policy of Digital
Equipment Corporation to identify smoking and nonsmoking areas when this
is judged to be in the best interest of employees or for the protection
of the Company's assets.  In all other circumstances it is expected that
employees will treat each other with mutual respect and work together
toward reaching mutually acceptable solutions when conflicting wishes
arise on smoking issues.

PRACTICE

WORK AREAS

Smoking will be allowed in areas of adequate ventilation and designated
as smoking areas by the host/facility manager.  Smoking will also be
allowed in undesignated areas where all parties agree smoking may take
place.

AREAS OF COMMON USE

Smoking will be permitted in enclosed locations such as conference
rooms and  classrooms only if all parties agree.  In larger common
areas, smoking will be permitted in designated areas provided there is
adequate ventilation.

SAFETY

Smoking will not be allowed in areas designated nonsmoking for reasons
of employee safety or protection of Company assets.

RESPONSIBILITIES

Managers - Managers are expected to provide leadership for smoking
problem resolution in accordance with the spirit of this policy.  In the
event the immediate manager cannot resolve the problem, the organization
or site manager should be consulted.

Employees - Employees are expected to resolve problems relating to
smoking through mutual accommodation and respect.

GUIDELINES FOR PROBLEM RESOLUTION

All Digital employees are expected to behave in a manner which values
and respects others.  Behavior concerning acceptable smoking practice
would encompass statements such as, "Do you mind if I smoke?" and "I
would prefer you not smoke".

People who wish to smoke in Digital facilities should take into account
that others may be medically affected by smoke and still others find
smoke annoying.  Employees who choose to smoke at work are expected to
do so in a manner that does not adversely affect other employees.

Captain's Log, NBS date 19840803.5, Captain Kirk reporting.  The Entryform,
on a routine mission to the planet Final Release, has encountered some
strange interference from an unknown source.  Science Officer Spock is
investigating.  All other ship's functions operating according to the APR.

{ Scene opens onto bridge of the Entryform }

Kirk:   Very unusual interference we're getting.  Lt. Uhura, can you
        pinpoint the source?

Uhura:  Not exactly, sir.  But it seems to be coming from dead ahead.

Kirk:   Mr. Chekov, plot a course dead ahead, but don't take us too close --
        we don't know what it is yet.

Chekov: Course laid in, sir.

Kirk:   Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp Factor 2

Sulu:   Warp 2, sir.

Spock:  Captain, source of the interference coming into sensor range.
        Seems to be a very large ship, much larger than the Entryform,
        crew of thousands, but sir --

Kirk:   What is it Spock?

Spock:  There is no sign of any activity!  It's just sitting there and
        interfering with anything that comes into its area.  I will try to
        get a fix on the name of the ship.

Bridge Crew #1:  (Snidely)  Sounds like management, sir.

Spock:  No, no.  It's even more devastating than any managment structure.  Ah,
        it's coming in now.  The ship is called... Central Engineering.

Sulu:   I have heard of it sir, very dangerous.  That ship has incredible
        weapons systems, but has almost no engine power.

Chekov: That's right, Captain.  They have a secret weapon known only as
        goal conflicts.  I remember once an entire Software Services
        armada on a special mission was destroyed with these conflicting
        goals.

Kirk:   Alright, gentlemen, let's see what this thing's made of.  Standard
        orbit, Mr. Chekov.  I think we can just run circles around it for
        now.

Uhura:  Captain!  receiving message from Central Engineering.

Kirk:   On audio, Lieutenant.

Voice # 1:  Starship Entryform.  This is the High Galactic Empire Flagship
        of Central Engineering.  Slow your ship's speed.  We cannot track
        a ship moving as fast as those from Software Services.  If you do
        not slow your speed, we will destroy your ship with our latest
        weapon.  We can use it to neutralize hundreds of your crew at a time.
        it's called a ...  meeting.

Bridge Crew:  No! No! Not meetings!  We can't do anything when a meeting
        hits us.  Stop! No! Anything but meetings!

Voice # 1:  Alright then.  Prepare to send us all the engineering details
        of your ship.  We wish to study you.

Spock:  Untrue, Captain.  The history of this kind of creature is that it
        will use the ideas in our ship to design their own ship, and claim
        they invented it.

Kirk:   No problem.  Mr. Scott?

Scott:  Aye, sir.

Kirk:   Punch up the Baselevel 3 plans of the ship.

Scott:  But sir!  Our current plans are at Baselevel 327.2.  Baselevel 3 had
        more bugs than the Roach Motel.  Anybody would go crazy trying to
        use that version.

Kirk:   Just do it, Scotty.  Alien ship: we are sending you our plans.
        (Quietly)  Mr. Sulu, prepare to take us out of here, Warp Factor 12.

Scott:  But sir! My engines can't take that.  The hull is already soft from
        all the hot air currents coming off that monster ship.

Kirk:   You'll have to hold it together, Scotty.

McCoy:  (Walking onto bridge)  Did life support get an access violation or
        somehting?  It's hot as blazes down in sick bay.

Spock:  It appears that our friends out there waste a lot of energy and
        it's thrown off in the form of heat.  ready with those plans,
        Captain.

Kirk:   Tranporter Room.

Transporter Room Crew # 1:  Aye aye, sir.

Kirk:   Beam those plans to the enemy ship on my order.

Transporter Room Crew # 2:  We'll have to hurry sir, the bugs are just
        falling out of this thing.  Baselevel 3 must have been quite
        an adventure.

Kirk:   Transporter Room - energize!  Sulu, Warp 12 now!

McCoy:  (Stumbling)  Woah!  What in then name of orion is going on here?
        has everyone gone mad?

Spock:  We have narrowly escaped one of the most devastating forces known
        to Software Services, but we are now free to pursue our mission.

Kirk:   Ahead Warp 5, Scottie.

Scott:  Aye, sir. Warp 5.

Sulu:   Damage reports coming in, sir.  I'll put it on audio.

Kyle:   Captain, this is Lt. Kyle in engineering.  Damage Control reports
        Warp engines slowed slightly, some crew members confused, 3
        casualties, crewmen who watched the enemy ship closely were bored
        to death.

        Other crew near mutiny.  It seems they want the easy life aboard the
        Central Engineering ship.  However, our shuttle docking bays are
        overcrowded with crew from their ship who are looking for some
        excitement.

Bridge Voice # 2:  Captain!  Scanners report small very fast enemy ship
        approaching.  Sir, the ship is burning up.

Kirk:   Transporter Room.  Beam survivors aboard.  Bones, have Nurse Chapel
        meet us in Sick Bay.

{ Scene changes to Sick Bay }

Chapel: Captain, this is the survivor picked up from the enemy ship.
        He is ok, but just now regaining consciousness.

Kirk:   Who are you?

Alien:  We are called the Deadlines.

Chapel (to Kirk):  The Deadlines!  They are the most unpredictable, random,
        and awful civilization in the universe.  They cause more headaches,
        more stress and more early death than even the dreaded forces of
        Great Management Nebula.

Kirk (to Alien):  Do you speak our language?

Alien:  Almost correct.

Chapel: What is your ship?

Alien:  My ship was yesterday.

Chapel: Yesterday?  Your ship was here yesterday?

Alien:  No, yesterday is here today.  Today was here yesterday.

Chapel: Where is your ship today?

Alien:  Today was here yesterday.

Chapel: If I got on your ship yesterday, would I be here today?

Alien:  No no, if you got on today, you would be here yesterday, but
        yesterday is here today so if you got on yesterday, you would be
        not be on today.

Chapel: Right.  So if yesterday is here today, and today was here
        yesterday, when will tomorrow come?

Alien:  Tomorrow may never come.  Today has gone and yesterday has been
        destroyed.  I am a Deadline with no yesterday, no today and no
        tomorrow.

McCoy:  Captain, he's going fast.  He's reaching his die date.

Alien:  Captain Kirk, you must search for tomorrow.  Only then will you
        find the answer to your quest for new life and new office systems.
        search for tomorrow today or yesterday will be your forever. { Dies }

McCoy:  He's dead, Jim.

Kirk:   (On intercom)  Chekov.  Lay in a course to search for tomorrow.

Chekov: What's that Captain?  Search For Tomorrow?  Isn't that daytime tv?

Kirk:   Just do it, Ensign.  Mr. Spock, meet me on the bridge.  We are about
        to begin a search for ....

Spock:  (Ominous)  Something unlike anything we've ever encountered before.

Kirk:   Uh, right, Spock.  To the bridge.

{ Back on the bridge }

Spock:  Am I to understand we are to search for tomorrow?

Bridge Crew # 3:  Sir, why not search today.  Tomorrow may never come.

Kirk:   That's what the Deadline said...  Uhura, put me on speakers.

Uhura:  Ship wide, sir, go ahead.

Kirk:   Crew.  We are about to embark on one of most dangerous and exciting
        missions ever.  We must search for tomorrow.  Only by finding
        tomorrow will we be able to defeat the terrible Deadlines that have
        kept us from discovering new life and new office systems.

Spock:  Captain, this is Dr. Wingit, our ship's efficiency expert.  He is
        our best source of information on the Deadlines.

Kirk:   Let's hear it, Wingit.  Have you actually met a Deadline?  Most of
        us here have never been able to meet one.  We almost met one once,
        but it expired.

Wingit: I have met many Deadlines.  They aren't really bad people, sir.
        They just have an over-inflated view of their own importance.
        Sometimes they appear irrational - less logical even than IBM
        standards.  They walk around making demands on people and
        sometimes get their attention off of the real goal.  they carry
        some formidable weapons, too.

        One of the worst is the Added Functionality Torpedo.  It works like
        this, once you get close enough to meet a Deadline, it fires an
        Added Functionality Torpedo at you.  You spend so much time
        avoiding it, you miss the Deadline.

Chekov: What else, Dr. Wingit?

Wingit: Another devastating weapon is the Corporate Reorganization.  Just
        before you meet the Deadline, it reorganizes itself so you can't
        even tell where you were let alone where you are going, and you
        miss the Deadline.

        Will we attack them, Mr. Spock?

Spock:  We'll have to, Wingit.

        Uhh, is there any known defense against these Deadlines?

Wingit: Yes there is, only one thing we can do -- and it's not going to be
        easy.  When approaching a Deadline, you must concentrate on the
        goal behind the Deadline.  There's always a goal, a plan, a reason
        for the Deadline being there.  And if you concentrate on tomorrow,
        on the final goal ...

Kirk:   (Dramatically, rising) The final frontier ...

Wingit: Yes, if you concentrate on the final goal, you will meet your
        Deadlines along the way.

Kirk:   So we must find tomorrow and study it...  Sulu, raise the shields,
        Scottie, I'll need Warp 10.  Chekov lay in a course for tomorrow.

Chekov: Tomorrow?  Heading, Captain?

Kirk:   Forward, out there, thataway (Gesturing)
