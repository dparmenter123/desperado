Imagine the second act of "Ruddigore".  Robin has just discovered that he
is the one with the curse, and sings his song about how he is going to be
a bad fellow from now on.  Now, consider the following text.

        Storming with indignation, afflicted past relief,
        My sorrow lacks remission, I question all belief.
        This my mortal element will one day come to grief,
        Plaything to the blustering winds, as brittle as a leaf.

        When choosing a location, the wise man will select
        A bedrock as foundation, his interests to protect,
        But I, the fool, am washed along, in my own refuse wrecked,
        A firm and solid footing, I everywhere neglect.

        To what then do I compare?  To a skipperless craft,
        To a bird tumbling through the air, blown away by the draft.
        No chains are there to bind me, no keeper holds the key.
        I seek such as remind me of my depravity.

        I consider the troubled thought to sport mal apropos,
        Sweet dissolution is my lot; what better way to go?
        What Venus bids her favorite rake (let dullards sleep the day)
        I'll not disdain to undertake, a consummate roue.

        The road abounds with ample vice; each will I sample twice.
        Virtue's a chore I've no need for, I'll pay damnation's price.
        To self-indulgence do I turn, salvation's promise spurn -
        Roast my soul, take Satan his toll, the flesh is my only concern.

Pretty Gilbertian, but actually this is a translation, by Jeffrey Duban,
assistant professor of Classics at Georgia State University, of the
section "In the Tavern" from "Carmina Burana" by Carl Orff.  The original
text, in Latin, was written by monks in the monastery of Benediktbeuern
in southern Germany during the 14th century.   The original starts
out:

        Estuans interius ira vehementi
        in amaritudine loquor mee menti:
        factus de materia levis elementi
        similis sum folio de quo ludunt venti.

I think Professor Duban has spent too much time in music halls.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Three cheers! _Carmina Burana_ was my introduction to choral music, and
that's analogous to meeting somebody who is to become supremely important to
you by having him walk up to you, say "Buss me, my lass, ha-ha!",
plant a resounding smacker on your innocent cheek, then swat you on
the bottom. Rowdy, it is, and instantly addictive. There's an excellent
recording by Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, with Lucia Popp and her lovely
voice singing the soprano solo bits (roughly akin in difficulty
to Zerbinetta's aria from _Ariadne auf Naxos_), now available at discount
prices from Angel records. It's schlock, God knows, but when the brain
says "Nuts" and the blood says "Goodie!", who are we to cavil?

     HUMA E-1636 Harvard:  Idea and History

     Peter J.  Gomes, D.D., L.H.D.   Plummer  Professor  of  Christian
     Morals  and  Minister in the Memorial Church, Harvard University.
     4 units.  Noncredit $120,  undergraduate  credit  $175,  graduate
     credit $470.  Tuesday, Sept.  24, 7:30-9:30 pm, Harvard 104.

     An  exploration  of  three  and  one-half  centuries  of  Harvard
     University.   Emphasis  on Harvard's identity as both an idea and
     an institution, including its intellectual  origins,  educational

Subj:   Many things

Here's a bunch of completely unrelated items...

A couple of months or so ago, I spoke with my manager about
leaves-of-absence. Oddly enough, there's no "don't wanna do this stuff
anymore" category in the leave-of-absence section of the personnel p&amp;p
manual...  There is one "to help prevent an illness...", though.  Pretty
close to what I had in mind.

Your mention of "worst movies" reminded me of a few new TV shows this
season...  One program I didn't expect to have on my "Most boring TV show
of the season" list was the new "Alfred Hitchcock Presents".  The premier
episode's story was OK with a nice twist at the end.  [Wife gets raped in
her home. Neighbors hear noise and call police.  Husband picks up wife at
hospital, where husband is told by world-weary cop that the odds are
billyuns and billyuns to one against finding the rapist.  Husband drives
wife home.  On the way home, wife looks up and shouts, "It's him!"
(pointing at a man walking along the street).  Husband parks car, follows
man, and kills him. Husband goes back to wife and continues driving home.
Suddenly wife looks up and points to another guy on the street.  "It's
him!", she shouts. Close-up on husband's anguished face.]  Very nice as a
five or ten minute story on Night Gallery, perhaps.  When stretched out to
a half hour...

Best movies of the past four or five years in no particular order: "On
Golden Pond", "The Last Starfighter", "Breaking Away", "My Bodyguard", "Das
Boot", "The Right Stuff".

Worst movie of this past summer:  Michael Cimino's (sp?) movie about the
Chinese mafia in New York, "Year of the Dragon".   Watching this movie, I
just sat there thinking "OK, this scene's from Rambo, this scene's from
Apocalypse Now, this scene's from..."  Although a very *very* pretty movie,
it was soooooo badly written.  I got the impression that the writers
decided to do the whole movie in just one pass.  No concern for continuity.
No concern for character development.  No feel for real people.  Just lots
of very *very* pretty scenery and some interesting symbols.  For this we
paid $4???

Worst movie of last summer:  "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom".  Such
a disappointment!  "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was bouncy, funny, exciting,
interesting, sexy, and breezy.  "Indiana Jones" was fast, bumpy, gory,
predictable, and empty-headed.

Absolutely no comment about "Return of the Jedi", except that the Ewoks are
the finest little people in films since the munchkins.  Sigh.

Subj:   Sic Transit Gloria

 I too was sitting at home watching Channel 5. I didn't think that they
overdid it until about 15:30. Remember (hindsight is always 20/20) that until
about 14:00, everyone believed that the storm would probably move
further east before moving inland; possibly coming up the Merrimack Valley
or even going over Buzzards Bay and across Boston. Now that would have been
entertaining!!

 Having said that, I have to admit that preempting some of the evening's viewing
for "Hurricane Gloria's Greatest Hits" and whatever else they did was excessive.
Although, Channel 5 was about the most professional of the three broadcast
channels in terms of their presentation. We lost the cablehead early on, so had
to drop back to receiving broadcast TV (using 30' of twinflex as an antenna!!)
so I had a quick scan of Chl 4 and 7 -- sigh.

 What irritated me beyond all understanding were the halfwits and morons who
were out driving around or playing on the beach or surfing while the storm was
coming right for them! I don't care about these morons personally (if they die,
it will make the world better for the rest of us), what I care about are the
rescue service personnel and volunteers (such as myself) who have to risk
life and limb to rescue these fools once they've got themselves into trouble!

Should stupidity be an arrestable offence?

Subj:   Hurricane Gloria report from Worcester (For DESPERADO)

I live in Worcester, MA and I never lost power.  I believe that this can
be primarily attributed to the fact that the city requires that the
utilities be underground.  In older neighborhoods you will often find
poles running through backyards.  There are a few outlying sections of the
city that do have wires crossing the streets, when you enter one of these
areas you notice that something is different, but it takes you a while to
realize what it is.  One of the reasons that you no longer see trolley cars
in Worcester is that it was hard to prevent electrocution when you had to
put the wires on the ground.

I didn't know the storm would be a wet firecracker - YOU didn't know it -
how could THEY know it?  Are they supposed to just ho-hum along?  Perhaps
stick with game shows and soap operas, with little overlays every few
minutes?  Right up until the storm hit Massachusetts, it had the potential
to be devastating.  Even in its reduced state, it made fascinating
television.  (Until our power went out, that is.)

Besides, they have these big organizations of (I'll admit) sensationalistic
and self-important people for whom Getting The Story is priority one -
and they have competitive pressures as well.  When they have a big story
handed to them on a plate, you expect complete restraint?  I thought they
did fine.

And a comment on DESPERADO:  As a subscriber to Nina Eppes' HUMOR and
Susan Hunziker's RIPLEY, a too-large percentage of DESPERADO (50%?)
is second-hand.  I don't know what you could do about this or even if
you should do anything, because the stuff is generally pretty good.
(I meant that I'd seen it before, not that it was second-hand, although
it is obviously that too.)
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Sigh. So grown-up, so grumpy. Of course, you're right, but if you can't
flame about TV news in DESPERADO, where can you flame? We're not here to be
reasonable, we're here to stay sane.

And are others out there of the same mind about HUMOR and RIPLEY? I thought
they were more local than DESPERADO. Anyway, Susan and Nina are so generous,
so faithful, and they find such funny stuff. Send me new, original,
amusing stuff, Andy, and I'll leave out the forwardings. The following, for
example, is just what we like to see going out over the airwaves:

Subj:   What I Saw on My

Is everyone back now, and is it all right to write "What I Saw on My Summer
Vacation"?  Actually "What I Saw on The Way Back From My Summer Vacation".

My new sister-in-law is a flight attendant on Air Inter, the airline on which I
returned from Nice to Paris.  We happened to be on the same flight (she was
deadheading home), and she arranged for me to sit in the cockpit on the landing
at Orly.  Now I understand why the passengers' windows are on the sides of the
plane (no architectural arguments, please): if everyone looked out the front,
they'd never fly again.  From about 10 km out, the landing strip looks about the
size of your thumbnail, AND IT NEVER GETS ANY BIGGER!  You just go lower and
lower and lower until somehow instead of flying, you're driving on an abnormally
wide road at a strangely high speed.  It was thrilling.  It was also pretty keen
to see how the cockpit crew interacts with hardly a word, reaching over each
other in every direction, it seemed, to pull, turn, or switch several thousand
apparently unmarked controls.

I'm sure this is humdrum to anyone who actually knows how to fly a plane -- it
was to the flight engineer [? -- anyhow, he wasn't in one of the pilot seats],
because when we had come to a stop at the terminal, and I said to him "I'm
beginning to believe that Man has been on the moon," he responded seriously "You
didn't believe it?"

The next exciting thing was getting a seat on my charter flight from Orly to
Boston at the worst-arranged check-in desk in the world.  Orly has a tiny little
area for charter check-in, and there were at least 4 flights accepting people at
once.  The entire room was filled shoulder-to-shoulder, and I was travelling
alone (my wife and daughter stayed in Nice with Luce's mother for another couple
of weeks), so I didn't dare leave for food or pit stop.  And I was lugging about
80 lb of luggage, household things that had to be schlepped back to the States.
When I got to the front of the line I made a wonderful discovery: my ability to
be articulately agitated in French, which happened when I asked for a nonsmoking
seat and the lady behind the desk told me there were none left.  Whatever I said
to her (and I certainly don't remember it in detail, but I do remember waving my
hands a lot), she left her position and hunted down some nonsmoking-area board-
ing passes.  I got 60A, which turned out to be the front left window seat in the
bubble of the 747.  Now, this was a chartered-configured 747, which means that
the bubble wasn't a haven of first class privilege, just the same narrow seats,
two by two; but we did have several advantages: no movie, our own galley, no
waiting for toilets, and plenty of room for carry-on luggage.  Only one disad-
vantage: the inescapable audibility of the young lady in the right rear seat
relating in boring and vapid detail to her seatmate "what Spain is like" (she
had been there a couple of days), "what Italy is like" (likewise), "what France
is like" ....  At least now I feel in touch with Today's Youth.

Not long before we landed in Boston I looked across my row.  We were all reading
books.  The title of the one I was reading is longer than the entire contents of
an average television series, and you wouldn't believe me anyhow, so I won't put
it here.  The other three persons' books were titled

        "Fame &amp; Fortune"
        "The Wheel of Fortune"
        "Fortune"

Do you think this means something?  Should we all be going for the MBAs after
all?

The Network and Communications group here at TWO will soon be moving to a
new site at King Street, Littleton. Conference rooms will be named for
"Notable New England Artists." Heading the list (first on the first floor)
is the Arlo Guthrie Room.

Other notable New England artists to be memorialized at LKG include:

James Whistler, Louisa May Alcott, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edward Everett
Hale, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Julia Ward Howe, Emily Dickinson,
Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth, Sarah Caldwell (I'll bet the members of the
committee never saw the Boston Opera production of Falla's La Vida Breve),
Noah Webster (the committee may have been tired when it was doing the second
floor), Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain (one wonders
if geography is still being taught. I know about the Conn. connection, but
...), Robert Frost, Norman Rockwell, John Singer Sargent, Margaret Fuller
(Really...), John Foster (!!??), Paul Revere, Gilbert Stuart, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Arthur Fiedler.

There's sufficient fuel for flaming there to heat New England out to its
western borders along the Mississippi this winter.

You all remember Margaret Fuller. When Thomas Carlyle overheard her remark,
"I accept the universe", he snapped back with "By God, she'd better!" She
later married a spurious Italian count and died in childbirth, poor thing.

In the last issue of Desperado, somebody mentioned Diana Riggs's
delightful collection of theatre criticism.  The best and probably
most devastating sentence that appears therein concerns the
performance of an Italian actor in a minor play. The reviewer
was Dorothy Parker (who else?):

        "Guido Natzo was natzo guido."
