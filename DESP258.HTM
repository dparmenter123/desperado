 Strangely enough, the old animated Disney version of "The Jungle Book"
 hews more closely to Kipling's ideas than the new live-action one
 does.  In the animated version, the bandar-log (monkeys) claim to
 have built the city, the king of the bandar-log (an ape) wants to be
 a man and thinks having fire ought to do the trick, Baloo and Shere
 Khan and Bagheera all have distinct personalities.  None of that in
 the new movie, which does have spectacular scenery and a silly chase
 plot suitable for eight-year-olds, including a great temple (Angkor
 Wat ripoff) and a Mowgli who definitely manages to give the
 impression that he's talking to the other animals and that humans are
 included among the animals.

 "The Madness of King George" is a swell show with an exciting plot,
 good laughs, a tear or two, a wholly legit happy ending, a bit o'
 wisdom, and lots of action.  The action really surprised me.  The
 king being wrestled to the ground by attendants had more of the feel
 of real adrenalinized human violence than and not stylized movie
 violence.  There was also lots of dashing about from castle to castle
 and stalking about in the fields.  Opened-up play it may be, but it's
 hard to imagine how closed the play must have been.

 Aficionados of the rudely shaped rude smelling fungus known by two

was expecting.

from nsrwatch(I think):
To resolve conflict, first answer the question, "Do you want to be
prompted when conflict occurs?"  If you select "No," then specify a
global resolution.

Looking for some help from the analog Desperadi:

I recall that Ken Olsen remarked about the VAX 8600 that this was the first
computer that was more complex than a single human could understand
completely. (The memory, cpu, and bus structure was such that no one person
could master all of the workings.)

For those of you who were in and around Digital in the mid-80's: did he
really say that (or something close to it) and, if so, was it pretty much a
true statement?

 I never forward stuff from Chuck Shepherd because his circulation is
 way bigger than mine, but I couldn't resist this item:

From: WEIRDNUZ.362 (News of the Weird, January 13, 1995)
by Chuck Shepherd

* Edward Curley, a senior test developer at Educational Testing Service,
admitted to Cox News Service in July that coached test takers could answer
reading comprehension questions very well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
without ever reading the appropriate passages.  Curley said that wasn't so
bad because the test was still measuring reading comprehension: "When they
read the questions, and [read] the wrong answer choices, and [read] the
right answer choice, the students are reading hundreds of words." [Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette-Cox, Jul94]

 The SAT is a crock.  It is with profound schadenfreude (joy at the
 pain of others) that I hear that the Educational Testing Service has
 adopted my view.  I have known the SAT was a crock since I took the
 PSAT.  I financed my number one son's college education by "coaching"
 him on the National Merit Scholarship Test.  "Just answer everything
 the way a boring white man would answer it."  I wasn't able to induce
 such cynicism in number two son, but he chose his college, in part at
 least, on the grounds that they didn't require the SAT.  It is a hoax
 and a con game, an Ivy League stunt.  For starter, the ETS has
 nothing to do with Princeton and is not even in the town of Princeton
 except through the courtesy of a mail drop.  The questions are
 insipidly fake and lame and the only univerisities in America that
 really pay any attention to the SAT (over grades and recommendations)
 are the Ivy League schools, which already have finer tools of
 discrimination at their disposal.  See the book "None of the
 Above:Behind the Myth of Scholastic Aptitude" for a complete
 demolition of these horrid people.

 While we're at it, IQ tests are a crock too.  Steven Jay Gould's "The
 Mismeasure of Man" takes the measure of the mental measuring crowd
 and finds them lacking in stature.  Although it was written in 1981,
 it destroys the arguments of this year's model, "The Bell Curve".

Today I saw a Cadillac on the highway, bearing Massachusetts
license plate "F2K".  It was a black Cadillac, not a candy-green
or pink one, so the owner may not have been aware of the meaning.
Anyway I thought you'd be interested.  ("2" in the original, not
added editorially by me.)

I also saw a lump of coal the size of a football sitting on the
sidewalk, and some horse manure in the middle of an Interstate
highway today, so this has been an unusual day.  Maybe I should
write to the Fortean Times.

The "centimeters" on the ruler on p. 227 of the Booklet are 0.97 long,
because:
