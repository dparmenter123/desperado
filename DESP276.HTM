 Did you know that Craig Shergold, the kid who got forty skillion
 postcards, recovered fully, is well and happy, and was not crushed by
 a stack of postcards?  His mother wrote a book,"The 'Get Well' Kid".

 In my recent stint at Apple, I was amused to be reminded that technophobia
 affects geeks as much as anyone else.  Geeks are terrified of Lisp
 (excepting the 2000 Lisp programmers) because Lisp has parentheses (!) and
 prefix arithmetic notation.  Golly, parentheses are one of the few
 elements that function identically in mathematical and literary contexts,
 and the notion that + is an operator that will take any number of
 arguments just does not seem beyond the capacity of even a geek.  Taken
 together, these hardly seem such burdens as to justify staying with C++.

 If you've done me the courtesy of wondering what was happening with me, I
 was stunned by the Oklahoma City bombing (being still enraged about the
 Branch Davidians).  I started writing an essay on patriotism and it just
 got longer and longer and the mail piled up and before I caught my breath
 I was hopelessly behind.  I was working long shifts at the time (my
 nap-filled unemployment having come to an end) and that may have had
 something to do with it as well.

 Henceforth, I'll send you mail all the time and many will wish for the old
 days of fully formed digests, but those days are gone.  You'll be getting
 more shorter pieces, including a few forwards, originals, and some
 responses to what has gone before, such as the following:

Subject: Bubble ``paper''

If you ever want to be put off your salmon roe, stuff a wad of pink
bubble wrap under a bell jar, then watch the bubbles distend and rupture
as you pump down to a fraction of an atmosphere.  Almost as disturbing
as a York Peppermint Patty (TM) in a microwave oven.

Tom,

        Your comments concerning the twisting of bubble wrap
reminded me of our Halloween practices.  My wife, Alicia, usually
takes the kids out to trick-or-treat.  I stay at home to hand out
the treats.  Not wanting to just hand out candy  I decided to put
on a little show of my own.

        For several years I came to the door with a real double
bladed ax with some red substance smeared on the blade and in a
menacing manner asked what they wanted.  It was fun watching the
looks on their faces as they took a couple of steps back.

        A couple of years ago I started answering the door by
opening it and asking them to wait a moment because I was in the
middle of wringing a chickens neck.  I would then turn away from
the door and twist the bubble wrap.

        We live near the end of an inhabited section of road and
we never got a large number of trick-or-treaters.  The last few
years we have been only getting the neighbors.  Hmmm... ruins all
the fun.  They know I won't actually wring necks, at least not in
front of them, or chop them up.

To: tompar@world.std.com

A friend of ours had this observation on her current manager:

"That guy has less people skills than a dead cow."

I'd love to hear what other people say about their managers. :-))

     I use a little macro keyboard that fits in back of the F1-F12 keys
     called AutoKey 20/20 made by Mextel.  It works for all programs as it
     emulates the keyboard directly. It costs in the $240 dollar range.
     It is really great for FrameMaker on a PC.  With one key I go to a
     page, or zoom to a full page or zoom in.  I can use all those strange
     short-cut keys such as &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;SHIFT t or what ever.  You get 20 extra
     keys.  Each key can be programmed 20 different ways.  This gives you
     400 macro keys.  You can call Mextel at (708) 595-4146.  They are
     located in Bensenville, Illinois.
