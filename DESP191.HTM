Subj:   Do Fries Go With That Shake?

Well, here you have it, a First-Hand Report (TM) from Someone
 Who Was There (TM) at The Great Quake of 1989 (TM).  Sorry if
  I can't tell any tales of terror and destruction, but the
   worst thing that happened to me is that I had to clean a
    plant up off the floor.

My own experience was rather mild.  I was in the car, near
 home, and it started to cast about as if I was in a boat.
  My girlfriend thought there was something wrong with the
   car until I pointed out that the other cars were shaking
    too.  (This was her first earthquake and my third.)

(My first earthquake was in Pennsylvania.  I was playing
 pinball and running up a very good score, when suddenly
  the TILT lit up.  My second one was here, in the middle
   of the night.  I was shaken awake and, when my roommate
    told me what was going on, I went back to sleep.  By
     the morning I'd forgotten it, as if it were a dream.)

We suspected something bigger was up when all the radio
 stations went off the air, save one.  On that one, the DJ
  came on and said, "Whoah!  That was a big one!  Well,
   we're still here."  He continued playing music, but it
    slowed down to a halt and they, too, were off the air.

Our cats like to sit in the back yard, next to the pool.
 I suspect they were in for a bit of a shock, seeing as
  how the pool managed to whip up a mini tidal wave.

We turned on the TV; stations were just getting back on the
 air with emergency power.  The first pictures came back of
  the Bay Bridge, which connects The City (San Francisco)
   with the East Bay (where I live).  Part of the top had
    fallen onto the bottom.

That was scary.  We've been on that bridge quite a bit, on
 our way into The City.  Worse yet, the bridge was supposed
  to withstand an earthquake, even one of this magnitude.

(At this writing, seismologists seem to be split over whether
 the magnitude was 6.9 or 7.0.  The readings went off the
  scale at U.C. Berkeley.)

The quake hit when the World Series was about to start, so
 much of the country found out about it through sportscasters,
  those paragons of hard journalism.  One bozo said that
   he could tell, from the feel of the quake, that it was
    about 50 or 60 miles south of the stadium.  Uh huh.

Was this the same idiot who told the nation that the quake
 was centered in Fremont?  Fremont is where I live, and that
  erroneous report sent our families into a panic.  The
   phone lines were jammed with people calling to see who
    was alright.

To be honest, I was not very worried.  Chances of dying in an
 earthquake are actually pretty slim.  The latest estimated
  death toll is about 270.  With 5 million people living in
   the Bay Area, that makes the odds over 18,000 to 1.  I get
    more worried when friends drive in heavy traffic!  None-
     theless I, like everyone else, called my friends to see
      if they were alright, and called my family to tell them
       I was.

The worst of it, the real horror, 250 of the estimated 270,
 was the collapsed section of Interstate 880 in Oakland.  The
  upper ramp fell onto the lower ramp, trapping about 200
   vehicles.  It took the TV stations awhile to stop fixating
    on the Bay Bridge and to realize what had happened in
     Oakland.

[Ed. Note: Death toll plummeted to 65 since this was written.]

We sat at home, safe, warm, feeling vulnerable and helpless.
 I'd just had some minor surgery and could do nothing to help,
  not even donate blood.  Several days later I still haven't
   seen much of the destruction:  if I can't be of help I
    figure I should just stay out of the way.

Maybe that's why I'm so calm.  I'm not as shell-shocked as my
 friends seem to be.  I don't worry about earthquakes.  I
  worry about the death toll on our highways and I worry that
   so many people accept it.  I worry about the death toll in
    Central America and the million dollars this country spends
     daily to sustain it.

For a decade, now, the state of California knew that that stretch
 of I-880 was vulnerable to an earthquake, yet did nothing about
  it.  That angers me.  Oakland, especially that part of Oakland,
   is perhaps the least glamorous part of the Bay Area and I
    can't help but think that the road would have been reinforced
     had it run through a richer, whiter neighborhood.

I don't really want to end it on that note, but that's where I
 am right now:  unworried and a bit angry.  I've also got some
  stupid songs wedged into my head:  "Shake, Rattle and Roll,"
   "Shakin' All Over," and "Do Fries Go With That Shake?"  At
    least K.C. and the Sunshine Band haven't made their way in
     there.  Not yet, at least.

Subj:   late news

Hi all.  In brief, everything's ok.  When I finally got to the San Jose
house (only a mile or two from Los Gatos) Wednesday it looked like a
giant had taken the house and shaken it and everything inside flew
around.  The living room was wall to wall books, the kitchen floor was
covered in broken glass, crystal, and pottery.  The wild thing is that
the the only thing out of place at the Fremont place was a broom.

What's weird is how spotty and capricious the damage is.  Most of the
South Bay on Wednesday looked like a typical day:  people mowing their
lawns, pretty boys and girls in their sports cars, etc.  Two miles away
Los Gatos downtown is trashed.  In the city the Marina district is a
mess, but in the Buena Vista area there are hundred-year-old houses
that got no damage whatsoever.

The television coverage is oddly off, misrepresentative:  they're
showing these scenes of devestation in the Marina district as if that's
what the Bay Area looks like, while in reality the majority of the area
(even the city itself) is very close to normal; and while they keep
showing you pictures of the 880 disaster, it falls far short of the
reality when you SEE it.

Somehow that news report left of the interesting data that the
Kentucky Fried Chicken in Beijing is on Tiananmen Square where
the recent "unpleasantness" took place. I understand that at the
height of the demonstrations, just when you think business would
be great, that supply trucks were unable to get through to make
deliveries. The course of capitalism doesn't always run true.

Subj:   The boolean cube

The boolean cube comes from solid modelling systems (generally used for
Computer Aided Design).  The idea is that you can easily make a complex
shape by starting with a simple shape and adding and subtracting simply
shaped pieces.

The process of adding or subtracting a piece is called a boolean operation.
The reason behind this piece of jargon is that any solid object can (in
theory) be represented by a boolean (means TRUE/FALSE) expression that
evaluates to TRUE at every X,Y,Z point inside the object and FALSE at every
other point. The trick to "boolean" operations is to represent each simple
object with a boolean expression, and then to perform a logical operation
at every X,Y,Z point to see if that point is in the new object.

To generate the boolean cube:
        1. Find a boolean expression for a regular cube A(x,y,z)
        2. Find a boolean expression for a smaller tilted cube B(x,y,z)
        3. The boolean cube is specified by
                BC(x,y,z) = A(x,y,z) .AND. ( .NOT. B(x,y,z) )

Cubes were popular for early demos because arcs were hard to draw, and the
"boolean cube" was about the most complex-looking thing that could be drawn
without using any arcs.  Thus the "boolean cube" became the fixture demo
only because we all cheated.

"Furtle" is not in "A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English",
by Eric Partridge, 8th edition.  This is an enormous reference work in
which I have successfully found all manner of slang, particularly
British, certainly including the entire 19th century.  If Partridge
doesn't list it, I consider it virtually certain that there is no such
word.

When I was a lad, I was told a different story about how a mathematician
hunts a lion in Africa.  (Let's switch to a nice tuskless beast.)  First,
he builds a wall that bisects Africa.  It can be shown that the lion is in
one of the two partitions.  He then builds a wall bisecting that, and so on
until the lion is sufficiently confined to be nabbed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A contribution to the mathematical theory of big game hunting ...

The following represent several mathematical methods for capturing a lion
in the middle of the Sahara:

* The method of inversive geometry.
        We place a spherical cage in the desert, enter it, and lock it,  We
        perform an inversion with respect to the cage.  The lion is then in
        the interior of the cage, and we are outside.

* The method of projective geometry.
        Without loss of generality, we may regard the Sahara  as a
        plane.  Project the plane into a line, and then project the line
        into an interior point of the cage.  The lion is projected into the
        same point.

* The "Mengentheoretisch" method.
        We observe that the desert is a separable space.  It therefore
        contains an enumerable dense set of points, from which can be
        extracted a sequence having the lion as a limit.  We then approach
        the lion stealthily along this sequence, bearing with us suitable
        equipment.

* The Peano method.
        Construct, by standard methods, a continuous curve passing through
        every point of the desert.  It has been shown that it is possible
        to traverse such a curve in an arbitrarily short time. Armed with a
        spear, we traverse the curve in a time shorter than that in which a
        lion can move his own length.

* A topological method.
        We observe that a lion has at least the connectivity of the torus.
        We transport the desert into four-space.  It is then possible to
        carry out such a deformation that the lion can be returned to
        three-space in a knotted condition.  He is then helpless.

* The Cauchy, or function theoretical, method.
        We consider an analytic lion-valued function f(z.  Let X be
        the cage.  Consider the integral:

        1/(2 * pi * i) integral over C of [f(z) / (z - X)]dz

        where C is the boundary of the desert; its value is f(X), i.e.,
        a lion in the cage.

* The Wiener Tauberian method.
        We procure a tame lion, L0 of class L(-infinity, +infinity), whose
        Fourier transform nowhere vanishes, and release it in the desert.
        L0 then converges to our cage.  By Wiener's General Tauberian
        Theorem, any other lion, L (say), will then converge to the same
        cage.  Alternatively, we can approximate arbitrarily closely to L
        by translating L0 about the desert.

* The Schrodinger method.
        At any given moment there is a positive probability that there is
        a lion in the cage.  Sit down and wait.

* A relativistic method.
        We distribute about the desert lion bait containing large portions
        of the Companion of Sirius.  When enough bait has been takes, we
        project a beam of light across the desert.  This will bend right
        around the lion, who will then become so dizzy that he can be
        approached with impunity.

* The thermodynamical method.
        We construct a semi-permeable membrane, permeable to everything
        except lions, and sweep it across the desert.

* The magneto-optical method.
        We plant a large lenticular bed of catnip [Nepeta cataria], whose
        axis lies along the direction of the horizontal component as the
        earth's magnetic field, and place a cage at one of its foci.  We
        distribute over the desert large quantities of magnetized spinach
        [Spinacia oleracea], which, as is well known, has a high ferric
        content.  The spinach is eaten by the herbivorous denizens of the
        desert, which are in turn eaten by lions.  the lions are then
        oriented parallel to the earth's magnetic field, and the resulting
        beam of lions is focused by the catnip upon the cage.

I'd say the philosophy instructor in the pen story did an
excellent job of making his point that things don't always
happen the way you'd expect.  The techie expected that the pen
in instructor's thought experiment would drop slowly to the moon
when released, but instead it floated away.  Refusing to be
enlightened, the techie went out and did a survey.  The
respondents' pens also floated away, which further demonstrated
the instructor's point.

I think this guy got his money's worth in that course, but he
doesn't realize it.

I was once in a diving contest.  It was free-style.  The kid ahead of me
announced he was going to do a gainer.  That's one of those headbanger
dives where you stand at the end of the board facing away from the pool and
jump out magically and dive straight in.  Instead of doing a gainer,
however, this kid fell off backwards.  However, he recovered fairly
gracefully, so they gave him first prize for a perfectly executed back
dive.  I'm still pissed about it and I was 13 at the time, 37 years ago, in
Waycross, Georgia, at the boy-scout camp.  You are probably smarter than
the philosophy teacher, Mr. Z, but would you call what he did a failed
gainer or a successful back dive?  Of course, we must be ready to learn at
any opportunity, however tenuous.  But yes, some people can't take a joke.
Your theory is that the teacher was using what psychotherapists call
paradoxical therapy.

[Publisher's note:  It's my fault that VAXmail and VAX Notes don't allow

where they put date-sent information, and how gateway software parses it
to produce proper RFC822 headers.  It's ancient history.]

Desperado folk may recognise the following scene from todays shopping:

ME: "Have you got XXXX?"
SHOP ASSISTANT: "No, there's no demand for it".
ME: "But *I'm* demanding it!"
SHOP ASSISTANT: "You know, you're the 4th person who has asked for this this
week. I'll tell you what I told them: there is no reason for me to get this in
- THERE'S NO DEMAND!"

Of course this always happens when you go looking for screws not in a plastic
bag of 100 gross, when you only need 3.

Alternatively I recently went to a Toyota dealer here in Sandhurst (where the
Royal Military Academy is, in England) to discuss the merits of their "Space
Wagon" family van, as opposed to the Nissan version.

ME: "What are the merits of the Toyota Space Wagon, as opposed to the Nissan
Prairie?"
SALESMAN: "Well sir, there's no comparison"
ME: "Humour me, I'm the poor sod trying to buy a family van. What are the
relative merits?"
SALESMAN: "They're just completely different animals, why would you even LOOK
at a Nissan Prairie?"
ME: "Because they're much cheaper, run on unleaded petrol and I can't see why
they aren't much better"
SALESMAN: "Well sir, there realy is no comparison"
ME: "I can see that now, thanks" (Leaving)

It really galls me when a sales person treats you like dirt, simply because you
have the temerity to ask them to do their job. "You want to spend money here?
Kiss my bum, clean my shoes, I may pay attention to you as soon as I get off
the phone to my girl/boy friend".

A final example of this was the AVIS lady at Logan recently who PHONED UP HER
LAWYER TO DISCUSS HER DIVORCE, halfway through arranging my car. Astonished, I
stood back, wodering if I was to be sued for interrupting her job, but nope,
she spent the next few minutes discussing her (ex-)husbands habits in and
around the home. I finally gained her attention by indicating the HERTZ stand
next door and saying something like "serve me, or THEY will".

Apart from tearing these people apart with my bare hands, I really have run out
of what you can do in this situation. If you really HAVE to buy whatever it is
they are selling, what on earth can you do?

I'm thinking of taking a waterpistol in to gain their attention, but perhaps
fellow desperados can make suggestions?

And I went to the bank and the pen was tied to the table by a cable that
was short and twisted which made it hard to write with and I told someone
at the bank it was hard to write with and they said, "We haven't had any

anything and the damn thing's still there.  And then I took my canned clam
chowder to the microwave and set the phasers to SOUP and it dinged but the
soup was still cool so I set the phasers to SOUP again and I heard a thump
and a crash and a splash and opened the door to find that the damn stuff
had hit the roof and walls and tipped over the soup bowl and it took me ten
minutes to clean it all up.  There was a warning about the effect on
pacemakers, but not one word about clam chowder.  I had similar symptoms
with microwaving chicken livers once. What is it about slimy, shapeless
foods that gets them so het up in the microwave?

Subject: Keeping the electronic press free - some bad news

PREAMBLE:

This is a Canadian news item, but wherever you live you can be sure that
some bureacrat is planning to extend their influence over you.  The freedom of
the press is crucial to maintaining a free society.  Unfortunately, in a power
grab in the 1920s and 30s, most governments reserved to themselves the power to
allocate bandwidths in a broadcasting spectrum for TV, radio, and other uses
'in the public interest'.  This argument was obsoleted when very wide spectra
and overlapping local area coverage became available for broadcasting (cellular
radio is an example, so are VSAT terminals).  Nonetheless, institutions like the
FCC (in the US) and CRTC (in Canada) retain their power over broadcasters,
issuing them licenses, regulating their content, and holding them legally
liable for what is broadcast (forcing them to self-censor very heavily).

Meanwhile, the telephone system, which is point-to-point, is a 'common carrier',
that is, it carries communications for a fee, and is not legally responsible
for what is transmitted.  You can't sue the phone company over an obscene
 7 years.  Rubin
  intended the gun as a "first-grade graduation present" for his son, 8.

- A Greenville, S.C., jury gave Evelyn Kuykendall, 67, $300,000 for injuries
  suffered when faith healers Charles and Frances Hunter failed to catch her
  when she fell backward after having the spinal-injury demons exorcised from
  her body; the fall broke her back.
phone call, and this is very important protection for them and for us -
otherwise, they would have to monitor every phone call and censor it as they
thought fit to protect themselves from lawsuits.  Just like TV!  This is what
is in store for us when the press becomes primarily electronic - censored,
controlled, safe, the realm of established money and power.  When paper is
too expensive to print news on, sometime in the next century, governments
would then be left with the power to control our most important medium of
communicating news.  Whatever you think of the TV news, to have it be the
only access to reality available to anyone would clearly be a disaster.

Of course, government would like that.  Nobody could check up on them.
Clearly, where the free press meets the meek mass media, as in computer
networks, the legal environment will be the greatest common denominator,
that is, the most restrictive subset of regulations is made to apply.
All electronic transmissions to a small audience must be treated as private.
Otherwise, the brave new electronic media will become as banal as the old.

Public-access 'broadcasting' like this Unix machine would be legal until
I tried to 'publish' anything other than text, at which point the operators
of this machine would become criminally liable for 'pirate broadcasting',
even though we have taken no bandwidth from others, nor provided it to
anyone who didn't explicitly request it.  'Publishing' graphic software,
since it 'generates moving pictures' would also seem to be illegal.
Certainly anything involving a video clip would be right out.

We seem in Canada to be in a rut with this sort of idiocy - there is a
censorship law that defines pornography as 'showing anal or oral sex'
and a Calgary comics shop was recently prosecuted for 'selling explicit
material to children', although the graphic novel in question, including
a full-frontal nude, was clearly marked 'for adults' and was on a top shelf.
Some judicial morons clearly think drawings with word balloons are always
for kids.  These same judicial morons might think graphics are just movies.
Obviously the law is being made to be oblivious of content or redeeming value,
so any attempt to provide intelligent erotica, graphic novels for adults, or
private/closed-loop electronic media or hypermedia will be under their control.
In the same bill, the CRTC's grip is extended to cover educational TV.

What's the American position on this issue?

Some of the original posting follows...
- --------------
If you grab a Globe &amp; Mail from Friday the 13th, you will see some
very bad news.

A bill was just introduced by the Tories to widen the CRTC's mandate
to *include* pay-per-view systems, and by extension, hypermedia publishing,
private videoconferencing, and any distance transmission of material 'other
than text' privately to a requesting viewer.  An earlier version of the
bill specifically excluded transmissions 'to a person specifically requesting
it', but that clause was omitted on the complaint of broadcasters...
of course!  They paid big money for these licenses and they don't want them
undermined by people interested in artists' and alternative video,
unpredictable new technologies, community information systems, making all
kinds of information easier to get... they want these people (us) to be
restricted by all the same Canadian-content rules, licensing fees, and
censorship as they are.

The bureacrats claim this doesn't affect interactive text systems, but it
sure as hell is going to affect hypermedia systems and electronic publishing!
This is probably the end of the electronic free press, at least in this
country.  The move is rightly identified by the Globe as 'a very significant
broadening of the CRTC's mandate' beyond issues of bandwidth allocation in
the public interest and into outright interference in free expression,
though that isn't how they put it.

Even leaving out the alarmism, it is clear that forcing electronic publishers
to abide by regulations devised for broadcasters, rather than protecting them
under the umbrella of the free press, will severely retard what they can do.

Imagine - even if your PC by 2000 can broadcast/transmit full motion video,
and presumably audio too, since the regulations cover radio, you won't be able
to do anything with this capability without a license, even if everything you
'broadcast' is in response to specific requests by customers/friends.  How the
hell do you calculate 'Canadian content' in a system like a BBS, where anyone
can contribute ?  Of course, such systems won't be allowed.

This legal obscenity would seem to apply even to video transmissions
sent over 'cable' from one workstation to another on a LAN... hard to say
without seeing the law.  Of course, we all know how they'll solve that one..
of course, they'll solve that problem by broadening their mandate once
probably by registering all computers, period.

They'll never get mine.

Civil disobedience is the answer.  Everyone get ready to set up your own
'pay-per-browse' hypermedia station, and prepare a nice 'fuc* you' letter
(try to say *that* on TV and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about)
to send to the CRTC and the papers.  If the electronic press is not kept
free, then we'll have lost a crucial protection of a free society.

Anyone in favor of this new law, speak up now so we know who you are.

Dear Readers,

I always seem to finish these babies late on Friday afternoon, no matter
how much I try to get them out faster.  An interesting experiment is afoot,
however, in that I have #2022 about half done already, so let's see how
fast I can unload it.

Best to all of you and yours,
Tom Parmenter
