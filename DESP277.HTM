Tom,

I have only been able to connect to the Darwin Station once since then, but
my first time was exciting.

Hi Charla,

I think I've got the hang of this web browsing thing now. It's kind of
like finding my glasses when I was looking for my sweatshirt...

Actually, I had a GREAT net surfing experience tonight. I visited
the Galapagos via Cape Verde. Wierd but true. I browsed
http://www.interport.net/~ednorman/cyberguide.html and noticed there was
a link for Cape Verde. Since Nancy;'s ex-landlord and his daughter are
going there soon, I thought I might dig up something useful for them.
I've given up looking for useful stuff for myself and sort of just go with
the flow wherever the web takes me. So I link to the Cape Verde page, which
is pretty much under construction. I notice a link to status of the active
Fago Volcano. Since I am interested in volcanos, I follow the link
and end up on the GVN home page (Global Volcano Network).
Lo and behold, there is a link to eyewitness reports on the Fernandina
eruption! I follow the link and avidly read eyewitness accounts by
volcanologists and Tui de Roy (my heroine - photographer who specializes
in Galapagos wildlife, especially Fernandina). So, when I back out of
that I notice there is also a link to the Charles Darwin Research Station.
How could I not follow it? So like bits of data from Santa Cruz Island
sped towards me at 2400 baud (the modems in the Galapagos are REALLY slow).
I find cool stuff about the land iguana restoration program, and a list
of e-mail addresses (including one of someone I met there), and a list
of job openings (alas, I have no PhD in environmental studies and my Spanish
is pitiful - sigh - one of the jobs sounded perfect except for those little
glitches). I could NOT have found this stuff if I was looking for it!
(BTW, the Ecuador home page did not have a link to the Darwin Center at least
as of last week). This is amazingly fabulous.

Yours in computing,
Janet

    This came babbling out of my mouth at lunch on the 13th or 14th.
    It received such good instant reviews that I've repeat it many
    times since then.

I've come up with a catchy phrase to label the infamous Exon Bill as well
as any others which seek to stem the free flow of, "Erotic images" on the
Net. Henceforth, Exon and its ilk should be referred to as, "Three Strokes
and You're Out" bills.  The Cognoscenti will apprehend the connection
rightaway.  The Congress may need a picture pamphlet.

The last desperado that I received was the second that included the
emacs give the NSA a hard time keyword insertion.

Given the events of a few weeks ago and the politics surrounding them,
I wouldn't be surprised to find you vanished.

On a related note, I attended the IEEE NH chapter meeting in ZKO
this past wednesday, featuring Scott Bradner of MIT, and he had an
interesting anecdote.  IPng currently is proposing that encryption
be mandatory for conformance, plus MIT has been a key player in
smoothing things out between RSA and those involved with PGP, and
as a consequence folk at MIT get to talk with official folk from
our government.  An assistant attorney general, speaking off the
record and in a completely unofficial capacity and of course this
is hearsay so it means absolutely nothing, said something to the
effect that she was certain that Congress would out and out prohibit
any encryption that didn't involve some sort of government santioned
key escrow.  While its recognized that there is no way to prevent
anyone from using encryption, such use would be grounds for
prosecuting "criminals", just as income tax laws were used against
many crime bosses.

Of course, this is also the ideal law to lock up political opponents,
whether on the left or the right.  I'm sure that the Republicans are
backing the with an eye to controlling criminals, plus those radicals
on the left and right are good targets too.  And the Democrats are
salivating over being able to nail right wingers with this one so they
can tar and feather the Republicans, but they are almost completely
ignoring the reality that conservatives are much better able to
justify their actions based on "means justifying the end" and "the
Democrat's screwed us so its only reasonable to screw them back" (also
known as an eye for an eye).

Its time to start encrypting everything, no matter how mundane.

 Well, yes, encrypt everything, and pay cash for everything while
 you're at it, but I don't think that the forces in government who
 want to control the flow of information can be identified with the
 petty to and fro of America's so-called ideological battles, but
 rather from that ineluctable urge to run everything (except the
 insurance industry).  But even without encrypting everything, it may
 be that not only will our own government not be able to control our
 internal communications, but our free mode of discourse is being
 exported to places where the government always had control of
 internal communications.
