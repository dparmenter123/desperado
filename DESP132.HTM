Subj:   Excuses for nonsmokers

Heard this weekend:

         If people are smoking and it is bothering you,
         squirt them with a water pistol.

         If they ask you why you are doing it, tell them
         that it relaxes you.

         If they ask you to cut it out, tell them that you
         are trying to cut back.

Subj:   VACATIONS!

      I have never come across anyone soliciting vacation stories before!
This is rather like asking someone to show their slides - 423 foggy views
of Antwerp railway station. Right? Anyway, you asked and who am I to turn
down an opportunity.

      Back in 1979 Jane (Ward) and I decided that we were going to take a
"once in a lifetime" vacation (package tour) to Kenya. Well, it was "once
in a lifetime" in so far as you can only do the first trip once. What happened
of course, is that we got totally hooked and have been virtually every year
since. It didn't take long for me to work out that, good though the package
might have been, it was far from optimum in terms of either value for money
or seeing some of the less usual sights. That was the point at which we started
to do it ourselves. It was also the point at which our numerous friends said:
take us too! So since about '81 we have climbed aboard BA with varying numbers
of friends and headed for Nairobi.

      I'm not going to try to catalogue an entire trip so much as sketch some
small vignettes, so here goes.

*Kenya is getting up at 6am, standing outside in crisp, cool, dry air and
watching the snow on Kilimanjaro turning from pink to white in the rising
sun. Realising that the deep shadow a couple of hundred yards away isn't the
rock you thought it was, but an elephant quietly munching breakfast.
Recognising that the trees you didn't remember from last night aren't trees
at all but giraffes. Grabbing the camera as you realise the said giraffes are
about to pose beautifully, but briefly, right in front of the mountain. (Here
comes that slide show again).

*Kenya is not a zoo! In fact we have only been to a zoo once since our first
trip and left very quickly. In Kenya the tourists are put in small groups into
small cages called minibuses or landrovers and then driven round for the
animals to look at. The animals do not appear to carry cameras.

*Kenya is meeting a young Maasai warrior out in the bush. He spoke only his own
language - not even Swahili. He had no idea how old he was - only which age
grouping he belonged to. (He was probably about 16.) He was at the stage of
life where a young warrior goes off into the bush for 3 years with nothing but
his spear. We had spent 2-3 hours looking for leopard which are notoriously
difficult to find. We asked him (through an interpreter, needless to say) if
he knew where we could find one. He replied instantly that there was one "over
there", meanwhile pointing. He climbed in the front of the jeep and we set off.
He took us about 4 miles, up and down escarpments, across streams and through
the bush. This took about 1/2 hour and we were wondering who was taking who for
a ride. We came to the bottom of a long slope with a solitary tree about 1/2 a
mile away. The Maasai pointed and said "under the tree". Sure enough. under the
tree it was. Not a leopard, though, but a cheetah! It turns out that in Maasai
they only have a word for "big cat" without all the variations. But that was a
really incredible experience.

*Kenya is seeing 23 lions before breakfast. (Yes, you can get tired of lions.)
This was in the Mara which is the Northern extension of the Serengeti into
Kenya. Coming back to breakfast at Governor's Camp. Huge mounds of bacon, eggs
sausages, tomatoes, fruit juice, fresh fruit, wonderful Kenyan coffee or tea.
Sitting outside at a table spread with white linen and china, watching a
buffalo browsing of the grass about a hundred yards away.

*Kenya is learning the difference between white and black rhinos. The white
rhino is not white at all. The word comes from the Afrikans "weit" meaning
"wide" and referring to the mouth. The white rhino is very docile and we have
the obligatory picture of Jane leaning on one. The black rhino, which actually
doesn't look all that much different, is not docile. The philosophy of the
British Army is "if it stands still, paint it." The black rhino's approach is
"if it moves, charge it. If it stands still, charge it anyway and the perhaps
it will move......." I remember going down a track in the jeep with a rhino
behind giving an excellent imitation of Nelson Picqet, especially on the
corners. Jane driving, me yelling "slow down so I can get a close-up", and
Jane, foot firmly down, muttering something about "crazy Englishmen." Can't
think what she was complaining about.

*Kenya is watching 15000 Wildebeeste on the other side of the Mara river and
hoping and praying that we are going to be treated to the sight of a mass
river crossing. Waiting for 45 minutes while a few nervous animals wonder
whether they can cross without being taken by the crocs. One suddenly takes
the plunge (literally) and in no time the water is a maelstrom as hundreds
follow to swim the hundred yards to the Northern bank. The come up on our
side and in no time are sweeping either side of the jeep in thousands. It's
almost too exciting to take pictures. In about ten minutes all 15000 have
crossed and, this time anyway, not a single casualty.

*Kenya is really nice people. Friendly, self-confident and with a tremendous
pride in what they and their country have to offer. Wonderful food and service
such as it is difficult to find anywhere these days.

*Kenya is spectacular birdlife. The first time we went we had thought animals
but found the birds equally demanding of our attention. Walking down to the
shore of Lake Nakuru to watch the flamingoes from about 20 yards. From the
lodge, about a mile away, the lake had looked pink until field glasses had
shown probably about 1/2 million flamingoes together. Roger Tory Petersen
described it as the greatest bird sight in the world. I think he was right.
Looking up into a tree and seeing a Verreaux Eagle Owl -- standing about
2 1/2 feet tall. Watching a fish eagle swoop across Lake Naivasha and take
a 2 pound perch with one grab of its talons.

*Kenya is sitting in the "bar" and watching a young elephant coming slowly
but deliberately towards us with the clear intention of joining in our
conviviality. Staff erupting from the kitchen banging pots and pans until he
backed off a little and settled for a munch of an acacia tree. Watching a
saggy, baggy baby elephant only 24 hours old being guided down the path by
mother.

*Kenya is turning a corner and finding a hippo out of the water. (A very
unusual sight in daylight). I wouldn't have thought a hippo could look
embarrassed but, I swear, this one did.

      Well, I could go on but that would be like the slide show that lasts
just too long, I suppose. (Of course, IF you want to see the slides we can
do that too...........).

      I'm about to leave Digital after 17 years. Amongst other things I
want more time to run more trips to - guess where. Jane will still be
around, though, in Stow, Mass.

      If you go sometime don't count on it being "once in a lifetime".
You'll go back.

I had a beau once who spent two and a half years at the foot of Mt Kilimanjaro
teaching little German children to speak English...we carried on a torrid
relationship entirely by aerogramme, but when he came back with his mind
full of the glories described above, I guess I paled by comparison...good
riddance, I guess. A man who'd prefer 1/2 million flamingoes to me is just
not what I want to have around the house.

A current Wall Street rumor had the economy of Madagascar near collapse
last month when a major purchaser cancelled all future orders for
vanilla beans, the major export.  Like most commodities, vanilla beans move
through intermediaries, so there was no way to identify the purchaser.
However, when Coke decided to bring back the old flavor, the market for vanilla
beans firmed up, and Madagascar was saved.  Interested observers deduced
from this one ingredient in the secret formula.

 CASTOR::COVERT                    The DECbox
 Note 1140.0                -&lt; DEC Alcohol Policy &gt;-               29 responses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attached is a DRAFT U.S. only policy on Alcohol.  It prohibits alcohol at all
DEC functions (service award banquets, release parties, IDECUS) but not at
functions with customers (DECUS) or private parties (noters' parties).

POLICY  (U.S. ONLY)

The use of alcohol at Company functions and social activities can
have unacceptable consequences for the Company.  The abuse of
alcohol in the business context can result in behaviour which is not
in line with the Company's values or policies, particularly those
policies which require respect for fellow employees, customers and
others.

Moreover, there is a clear and growing trend in the courts to hold
the provider of alcohol responsible for injuries to persons or
property which result from the consumption of alcohol.

It is the policy of Digital Equipment Corporation to refrain from
practices which support or encourage the use of alcohol.  More
specifically, the Company will not give, serve, provide or pay for
alcohol for employees at Company-sponsored employee activities.  In
addition, the use of possession of alcohol on Company or customer
property is strictly prohibited.  See policy 6.24, Employee Conduct.

PRACTICE

Company-sponsored Employee Functions or ActivitIES

Digital managers may not serve, provide or permit the use of
alcohol at Company-sponsored employee functions or activities.  As
used in this policy, the term "Company-sponsored employee function
or activity" is meant to include things like:

        o business meetings with employees,

        o gatherings which are paid for with Company funds,

        o gatherings where employee attendance is either required,
          expected, or encouraged by management (i.e., post-conference
          meetings or get-togethers which are scheduled by the
          managers),

        o gatherings which are planned, managed or paid for by the
          Company for purposes such as:  improving employee relations,
          rewarding and recognizing employee contributions, improving
          internal efficiency (e.g., service award banquets, employee
          outings, picnics or other recreational activities, retirement
          or promotion parties, etc.).

The above list is not intended to be all inclusive.  It is included
to illustrate that the policy prohibits alcohol at activities and
functions which are organized and controlled by the Company,
regardless of whether they are paid for by the Company.

Company-Sponsored Customer or Supplier Functions

This policy is not meant to prohibit the purchase or use of alcohol
for off-site functions with our customers or suppliers, nor is it
intended to license or encourage the use of alcohol at such
functions.  In those circumstances where it is traditional and
appropriate to serve alcohol to customers and suppliers (i.e.,
trade shows, hospitality suites, meals with customers, etc.), our
employees may do so in accordance with the Business Expense Policy
(Policy 5.11).  Employees who elect to serve or consume alcohol
under this section are expected to exercise discretion and to take
reasonable measures to prevent abuse.

Private Activity

The private activities and choices of employees are not covered by
this policy.  For example, nothing in this policy prevents, or
inhibits, the use of alcohol at spontaneous, off-site social
functions organized by employees on their own time, (or where the
only connection between the participants is their Digital
employment).
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Now, when I first came to DEC years and years ago, you didn't even provide
drinks to customers at things like trade shows. In fact, there was a famous
trade show at which the DEC hospitality suite provided for guests and customers
not hooch, but Oyster Stew!

        I think the idea behind Sniglets is to provide words that aren't in the
dictionary, but should be.  One *needs* a word to describe the ice buildup in
car fenders, and "fenderbergs" is ideal.
        Few people encounter ravens hip-deep in peanut butter.

        On the other hand, those pass"words" that VMS generates do seem to cry
out for definition, don't they?  And if we're going to define them, we'll need
a word to describe them as a class of words.  I suggest "wordoid."
        If "wordoid" is accepted, it may qualify as a Sniglet.

Sniglets is a registered trademark of Bell Laboratories, or something.

Subj:   Grapher 7/26/85

Intrigued by that very same intro from the Seminar Series I attended
Stanley Rabinowitz' presentation on Grapher on July 26th.  It was
Stan, by the way, who wrote up the intro you read.  He said he
managed to sneak it by edits by submitting it at midnight on the day
it was due.

Grapher is a fairly impressive piece of software.  It is a tool for
making directed graphs, but the controlling software for the Grapher
routines must be written by you.  That does not detract from the
wonderfulness of the tool and you can get a copy of the routines from
Stan.

If you ever get a chance to attend a presentation by this guy, do it.
I've never been given so much information and been so wonderfully
entertained at the same time since coming to DEC 5 years ago.  I was
surrounded by ZKO and MKO engineers (I'm an MLO engineer and I was
attending under cover, dressed in a suit) and the humor was wonderfully
ramapant on both sides of the podium.

I knew I was in for a wonderful afternoon when Stan, too short to
touch the top of the projection screen (as we all are!), rolled up
a tube of something like listing paper, pulled the end out, and
made himself an impromptu pointer.

Leaves me with pleasant thoughts of Grapher and ZKO.

The item in the recent DESPERADO about coffee had passed my way earlier -
from the usenet perhaps.  In any case, I too question the trustworthiness
of anyone who would advocate flavored coffees.

Anyway, the item spoke of the need for a trustworthy source, but did not
give the address of "Al".  Never fear, I too have a trusty source which
not only provides some of the best tasting and freshest coffee I've
ever run across, but is cheap too.  Community Kitchens of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana offers a variety of fine coffees, of various styles, roasts and
grinds.  Each bag of coffee is vacuum-sealed immediately after roasting.

I have been obtaining Community Coffee for quite a while now for our
coffee station (the "John Francis Memorial Coffee Fund") here in ZK.  The
varieties I get change from time to time, but right now I have Brazilian
Santos Bourbon, Costa Rican (strictly hardbean) and Celebes Kalossi.  (The
latter is just fantastic!)  Community offers seven varieties year-round,
plus a "Coffee of the Month" and a "Coffee of the Season".  At the minimum
order of three 12-oz bags, the prices start at about $4.25 a pound.  Most
are under $5 a pound, except for the more exotics like Celebes Kalossi.
However, if you order in multiples of 6 or 10 bags, you can get up to
50 cents a bag off.  Plus, if you have them automatically ship to you
at some interval you specify, you get another 50 cents off.  (I order
through their wholesale division, 40 pounds at a time, so my discount is
even better.)  Shipping is additional, and averages less than 50 cents
a bag.

Community Kitchens also offers "gourmet" teas, preserves and other items.
If you are in the ZK area, stop by our coffee station (by the Euclid
conference room on ZK2-3) and try a cup.  (Some die-hards even come the
length of two buildings every day for our coffee.)  You can get information
or order by phone at 800-535-9901.  The operators are very friendly and will
tell you about the coffees in great detail (as does the catalog).  If
you'd like more information, let me know.

        "So it does." said Eeyore.
        "It goes out." said Pooh.

        "It goes in and out." said Pooh. "It goes in and out like anything."

OK, here's some more.   Use them in the quiz if you want.   Some of these are
really old memory cells.   A large portion of them are coming up with
uncorrectable ECC errors, but a little digging will yield the correct text.

        What were the OEM versions of the 11/20 and 11/40 called?

        What was the 11/50?   The 11/T55?

        What was CTS-500 based on, and what was the primary programming
        language available?  (Or, at least, this was the reason we bought it.)

        What was the RT11 DIBOL compiler based on?

        Are there any 11/74's outside of the RSX lab (in customer's
        possession, I mean).    In fact, are there any left inside DEC?

        What was TRAX?   What was it based on?   What terminal was used
        for the "application" terminal?   How many licences were sold?

        What does IAS stand for?   What does PDS stand for?

        Fill in the question for this one:   The VAX had a PDP11/xx
        designation, I think xx = 90...

I was re-reading an issue of Smithsonian Magazine, April 1975, and found
this interesting ad.  Read it twice.

[Facing page: a small boy in a chair, with a red nose, a big bowl of

WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR YOUR HEALTH IS A LOT MORE COMFORTING THAN A
BOWL OF CHICKEN SOUP.

   When you're sick, you need a good bowl of soup, a tender hand on your
hot brow, sympathy and understanding.  Little things at home relieve a
lot of your misery.
   But a big corporation offers human solace too.  Many of the medicines
you find at your drugstore are made with our chemicals.
   Aspirin to bring down your burning fever, lozenges to soothe your
poor sore throat, sedatives to let you fall asleep at last.
   We help you get through a case of the sniffles.  But we're also
involved in more serious things.
   We make . . . [sundry medical goods: radioactive tracers, cryogenic

Subj:   Video without Pixels

From TV Guide,  August 10, 1985, TV Q &amp; A

Q. I understand the little dots on the TV screen are called "pixels." Can I
buy a TV set without any pixels?

A. All TV pictures are made up of many tiny points called "picture elements,"
or "pixels" for short. The more pixels, the sharper and more detailed the
picture. A picture with 250,000 pixels would be sharp, while one with only
50,000 would look quite coarse. If you don't want any pixels, turn your set
off.

Subj:   Desperado Soft Drink Menu (?)

From: Leigh L. Klotz &lt;KLOTZ@MIT-MC.ARPA&gt;

I've been assured by the local Coca-Cola bottler that henceforth Coke
will be packaged with a number 0-15 indicating the flavor.  All designations
such as "NEW!" and "Classic" will be dropped in favor of a consistent
numbering scheme:

   Bit 0: Classic/NEW!
   Bit 1: Sugar/NutriSweet
   Bit 2: Caffeine/No Caffeine
   Bit 3: No Cherry/Cherry

Thus, old regular coke will be Coke 0, and the latest Cherry Cokes
will start at 8.  The number will be printed in decimal on the top
of each container, and along the side in machine-readable UPC code.

An interesting sidelight is that all new Coke machines will be equipped
with numeric keypads.

Oh, those are WHISKERS!!  I knew it was a cat, but I thought it had
perhaps been given a mouthful of peanut butter and was trying to get
its mouth open again, and that's why its mouth looked like &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;
I'm glad to know that the poor kitty hasn't really had its mouth stuck
shut all this time...
