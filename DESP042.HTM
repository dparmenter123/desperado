Subject: the medium is not the message

     I wish to comment on the discussion a few issues back concerning  com-
     puter  poetry.  A computer wrote that poem as much as Da Vinci's brush
     and palette painted the Mona Lisa.   A  blood  and  guts  person  pro-
     grammed,  however poorly, that computer to generate the poem.  That it
     failed to do anything for anybody is only a reflection of this indivi-
     dual's aesthetic.  Perhaps in the hands of a more sensitive individual
     a computer generated poem could move us.   Twentieth  century  artists
     face  a dilemma of almost crisis proportion:  how to say basically the
     same things in new and different ways.  And we've been asked  to  con-
     sider  quite  a  lot;   Gertrude Stein, Jackson Pollack, and John Cage
     come to mind quickly.  I am not saying that we shouldn't be  critical,
     lord  knows  there  is  enough crap floating around on computers.  But
     computers have been used as a TOOL to paint, and  compose  both  music
     and  poetry for well over a decade now.  I personally think that we as
     computer professionals should welcome, nay  embrace,  the  artist,  as
     part  of the community of accountants, chemists, doctors, bankers, and
     whoever else are users of this perhaps ultimate tool.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Yes.  My original comment was that the people trying to do computer
poetry didn't understand poetry.  I think Pollack and Cage - but maybe
not Stein - understood their rackets well before they tried to
revolutionize them.  Only the best acrobats get to do clown routines.

I think computers are changing language and therefore thinking itself
and we are absolutely certain to get some new art out of them.  In
fact, that's why, aside from the money, I got into the computer
business, and it has a lot to do with what I'm trying for with
Desperado.

No, some are analog. Nice to see KERMIT back on its (his?) feet (flippers?)
again. I've been trying to respond to a comment on a much earlier mailing,
to the effect that the comma is the most misused punctuation mark: come, come;
surely that honor belongs to the apostrophe, whose misuse stretches credulity
to the breaking point (a favorite grafitto: "John loves Glady's"). Things have
gotten so bad with the apostrophe that its abolition is being seriously pon-
dered by those in charge of such matters (isn't there a sub-secretary some-
where in the Cabinet who's supposed to be responsible for American grammar?).

All of this is symptomatic of the folly of attempting to standardize language
in a diversified country like the US of A. Like it or not, the standardiza-
tion is under the control of an elite (and probably effete) group of Easterers:
a handful of powerful people on Madison Ave. How do YOU spell ROLAIDS? What
do you want, good grammar or good taste?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The U.S. Board of Geographical Names of the Coast and Geodetic Survey
of the Map Bureau of the Department of Commerce (or something like
that) decreed about ten years ago that *all* apostrophes were to *be
gone* from U.S. geographical names.  Not only does this give us
"Harpers Ferry" and "Millers Falls", but also the true abomination,
"Coeur Dalene, Idaho".  This last one apparently didn't take, by the
way.

The following was forwarded to me by a friend currently at U. Mass. Amherst.
It is interesting to note that it traversed 4 national networks to get here:
U Mass to Delaware via CSNET; to Berkeley via Arpanet; to DECWRL (Washington
State? - part of DEC West) via UUCP; to REX via the E-net.  (At Berkeley, it
probably traversed BERKNET, a local area net.)  Ah, the wonders of networks!

Ever feel oppressed by a programming language?

If programming languages were nations, their governments might
look something like this.

FORTRAN A fascist anarchy with few natural resources but considerable
        military might.
COBOL   A bureaucratic oligarchy which propogandized its dull citizenry.
ALGOL   A monarchy which divided rulership into a hierarchy of smaller
        political units; but lacked sophisticated social institutions.
APL     A small nation with advanced science, but primitive government,
        transportation, and services.  Because APL's currency was
        incompatible with that used by the rest of the world, trade was
        very restricted.
PL/1    A large dictatorship with military backing but unable to obtain
        popular support for its needlessly complex policies.
SNOBOL  A widely scattered society of highly literate citizens in the arctic.
LISP    A utopian anarchy with very little infrastructure.
POP-2   A colony of ALGOL which attempted to subjugate immigrants from
        LISP and SNOBOL.
BASIC   An oppressive dictatorship which easily took over many developing
        nations due to an absence of alternatives.
PASCAL  A bureaucratic state, borrowing its multi-level government from ALGOL,
        and having very rigid social institutions.  PASCAL was based on a
        constitution which the citizenry found necessary to break, and new
        constitutions were proposed by different parties (such as: MODULA,
        PORTAL, EDISON, etc.).
C       A monarchy with social institutions similar to PASCAL, but having
        considerably less red tape, and lacking a constitution.  C helped
        to set up the international trade organization named UNIX.
FORTH   A monarchy which, due to its extremely simple system of administration,
        won considerable support in the developing nations.
MESA    A conglomerate of states which developed reliable communication among
        the states, and made the government more accountable to the citizens.
PORTAL  One of several parties vying for the rulership of PASCAL, placing even
        greater emphasis on law and order.
SIMULA  A monarchy, much like ALGOL, in which personal ownership and private
        enterprise were allowed.
SMALLTALK
        An experiment in self government which, like SIMULA, allowed free
        enterprise; and which extended personal rights to allow groups to
        freely assemble and take on collective projects, not accountable to
        any central authority.  In this way, vast amounts of government
        duplicity were eliminated.
ADA     A very complex corporate state having many loopholes for the wealthy,
        a massive military establishment, and imperialistic ambitions.

Steve Gutfreund (once of the RSTS group and the Corporate Research Group, now,
like me, off in the academic world for a while) got to talking about some
generalizations we'd like to see.  In particular, consider the null device.
Why not:

        The null node.  Sending a file, say, to NULL::&lt;anything&gt; always
        succeeds.  Receiving from it gives an immediate end of file.

        Going in the other direction, we could have the null directory -
        appears on every device, contains all files - but they are all
        bit-buckets when written to, empty when read; the null file -
        appears in every directory, with the obvious properties; etc.

        Moving away from files, we have things like the null user - you can
        always send him mail, but you never get any from him.  Logging
        in to his account works but, of course, you get the null directory
        on the null device as your default and the null CLI - which, as
        expected, accepts any input and never produces any output.

        An interesting concept is the null message - useful when you have
        to do a PUTMSG call but have nothing to say.  There are actually
        a number of null messages - one for each non-null severity.  Thus,
        you could get:

                %-F-FATNULL-

        for the fatal null message.  And then there's the null severity...

As you can see, the concept of nullity has not been adequately explored.
I haven't even touched on applications in programming languages (null
variables, procedures, etc.), null OS services...

Here is a story to gladden the hearts of all true Millrats!

    Went into the big city last night to have dinner with my live-with,
    Terry,  who  was  pursuing  her  Digital  duties  at the big E.S.G.
    sales/marketing  convention  at  the  Sheraton.  Knowing I would be
    somewhat  out  of  place  in  my usual suave duds, I asked that she
    bring  in a coat and tie for me to change into before impersonating
    a  pillar  of  society.  (After  all, even Ronnie was in town, that
    day!)  All  went  well  and I met Terry with a group of DEC product
    line  people  siping cool ones in the lounge. (Where else would one
    look  for  DEC marketers?) Being somewhat depleted by the Mass Pike
    Wars,  I  was  easily  persuaded  to  bend an elbow before doing my
    switch.  In  time,  I excused myself and when off to change. When I
    rejoined  the  group, one of the three-piece- suited folk looked me
    over and remarked, "Well, now you look just like the other DECies!"

Can it be? Do people really think ties and coats when they think DEC?
I think I might have fallen through a time warp or something.

Subject: I'm flattered that you remembered

I double-checked with my fellow tape-mangler, Paul Kobar, and we both
agreed that in fact it was just a 600-foot magtape we unwound. The story
goes something like this ...

In software project leader land, you have to be aware of a number of
trivialities involved in getting products into and out of the SDC. One
of these concerns the proper way to construct magtape kits. (I learned
of this one while still working for Howard Lev on the RSX-11M V3.0
release; he obviously did not know about it and was on vacation at
the time.) There is an SDC guideline stating that any magtape should
not be more than 90% full. (Just for grins, quiz your project leader
to see if he/she is aware of that fact.) Here's why ...

        - It is likely that the size of the inter-record gap (the empty
          space between records on the tape) will vary slightly from
          tape drive to tape drive. It is also possible that if your
          drive writes them at the minimum end and their drive writes
          them at the maximum end and there are lots of records on
          the tape, this difference can be significant.

        - It is also likely that the stated and actual physical lengths
          of magtapes are not exactly the same. Again, if you created your
          kit on a tape that was somewhat longer than stated, and someone
          tries to copy it to a tape that is somewhat shorter than stated,
          you end up running into the little reflector strip at the end of
          the tape.

        - The SDC tape-copying programs will complain loudly if they encounter
          the reflector strip while writing the output tape.

A combination of the above happened to us during the submission of RSX-11M
V3.0 and I was one of the people that had to figure out why the SDC could
not copy some of our master tapes. So, after that we always created a set
of "short" master tapes to prepare SDC kits.

After submitting RSX-11M V3.2 (really was V4.0 in disguise), the SDC again
complained about one of our tape kits, giving us a very non-specific reason
but hinting that the tape volume was too full. So just to prove to ourselves
and to them that in fact the tape kit was an appropriate length, Paul and I
unrolled one and measured it.

I can't remember what the eventual diagnosis of the problem was, but it clearly
was not a problem with an over-full tape. By the way, the box of unrolled tape
sat in my office for a while after that -- no one volunteered to rewind it.

Subject: Advertising for the Professional

When it comes to advertising, the most successful campaigns involve
creating a very strong, fixed image in the target audiences' mind. My
feeling has always been that for a product like the Professional, DEC
would do best with a spokesperson - a Robert Young of personal
computers. Consider IBM. Whether or not you like the Chaplin figure,
it does create a fixed, recallable image.

Who would be the right person to represent DEC? Do we call
rent-an-astronaut? I know many people might disagree, but what about
Jimmy Carter? He's certainly a professional. It's common knowledge
that he himself uses a word processor. I doubt very much if he would
consider it in any case. Does anyone else have a suggestion?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
How about Elvis Costello or Harry Nilsson? They both used to be
computer programmers.  Fran Tarkenton is losing his job on Monday
Night Oblate Spheroid, but he also runs some kind of software
house.

It has to be someone intelligent and loveable (or generally thought to
be so).  That's why Bill Cosby is better for TI than Dick Cavett is
for Apple.  Cosby has both ingredients, but Dick, alas, only has
claims - not verified - on the former.

And speaking of unloveable, though allegedly amusing characters,
Charlie Chaplin has always made me ill at ease.  I laughed at him
once, when he tried to eat the shoe, but for the rest, forget it.  And
how could IBM have the balls to identify themselves as the Little Tramp!
IBM couldn't even make it as the Big Tramp.  I think that from all
America's comic characters there are more likely resemblants to IBM:
Foghorn J. Leghorn, perhaps, or King Kong, or Baby Huey.

As for DEC's comic image, the Marx Brothers evoke distributed
processing. And, in that case, Margaret Dumont could be IBM, with
Zeppo (or was that Gummo?) playing Apple.
