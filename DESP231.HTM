        I put a lot of stock in the names of things.  There's a Latin
        expression, "Nomen est omen" that pretty well sums up my attidude,
        meaning "the name sure does tell a lot" or something like that.
        Anyway, here are three naming tragedies, missed opportunities for
        laying a real good omen on the world.

        1 - When the trick skiers organized, they voted down the name
        International Hotdog Skiing Association in favor of the bland,
        Repbliican, International Freestyle Skiing Association.  They have
        since been merged into the gloomy grey (French-run) Federation
        Internationale de Ski, where they are just one more bureau and
        their event has turned into "the moguls".  If they'd gone the
        Hotdog route, who knows how wild it would have gotten?

        2 - The characters in the Chas. Addams cartoons mostly didn't
        have names, so when the TV show came along, they had to make them
        up.  They did pretty well:  Morticia, Gomez, Lurch, Tuesday,
        Puggsley, but it's something of a tragic loss that they didn't use
        Chas. Addams's name for Puggsley, the teenage boy, which was Pubert.

        3 - Worst of all, when Errol Flynn wrote his autobiography, the
        publisher forced him to use the moralistic and insipid title, "My
        Wicked Wicked Ways".  Errol had to forget his own title, which was
        inexpressibly truer and more autobiographical, "In Like Me".

                                    =*=

        Speaking of the Rock&amp;Roll Hall o' Fame, I forgot to mention that
        Johnny Cash also said he thought there should be gospel
        musicicians in there too.  Here!  Here!  And Hallelujah! while
        you're at it.

                                    =*=

        So, having summarily fired the E Street Band, Springsteen releases
        two albums recorded with Toto.  That makes it two Hollywood dogs:

                Toto and Old Yeller.

        Horrible as it is to contemplate, much less to say it, Dan Quayle
        is pushing two policies that I like.  No, that can't be true.
        Anyway, he has brought two issues onto the table that hadn't been
        on the table before, and I'm glad to see them there.  They are,
        the space program, which Quayle, in his ignorance, believes should
        be trying to get to Mars, not just running a bus service between
        here and halfway to the moon, and he's gotten all the lawyers mad
        at him because he thinks, in his ignorance, that there are too
        many lawyers making too much money off too many dubious suits.  I
        like the idea that the losing side should be vulnerable for costs
        in lawsuits, or, quibbling with myself, I like the idea that
        people should be discussing it.  I still think Quayle is a
        trust-fund ninny and an insult to us all, but as some noted
        Washington columnist said, "Quayle isn't as dumb as you think, not
        quite."  Since the average vice president never does one damn
        thing worth anyone's attention, I am forced to conclude that
        Qauayle *may* be an above average vice president.

        And when he runs for President I'll do everything I can to keep
        him out.

Tom,

Some months ago, I cut an item out of Desperado and posted it on my wall.
It goes like so:

        From: schwartz_m@wmois.enet.dec.com
        Subject: Quote of the Day

        Only two significant things came out of Berkeley: LSD and
        UNIX.  We don't believe this to be a coincidence.

One of my co-workers, Brian Harrigan, took at look at this and noticed that
it is wrong: UNIX didn't come from Berkeley, only the BSD variant of UNIX did.
Brian suggested that the line should really say "LSD and BSD".

It seems to me that the phrase "LSD and BSD" is not only more accurate but has
a real ring to it.  This suggests that perhaps "LSD and BSD" is the original
phrase, and was modified to "LSD and UNIX" as it was retold, over the years.

For example...

Ever notice that the second or third time you read a book,
you discover all sorts of typos and misprints?  The more
often you read a book, the more typos you find.

These typos are read-errors; mistakes introduced by reading
the text. To preserve accuracy, you should purchase a new
edition each time you wish to read a book.  Most of all,
avoid used books, pirated editions, and books from unknown
sources.

Public libraries are especially dangerous!  Library books are
read many times, introducing uncounted read-errors.  Worse,
borrowers (and some unscrupulous authors) can infect books
with literary viruses (analogous to computer viruses) which
can be transmitted to other readers.

You can avoid these problems by only reading from new books,
and purchasing fresh shrinkwrapped volumes at your local
bookstore.  Hardback editions are most resistant to typos and
literary viruses; get these whenever possible.

        A couple of points from the book:

        He wasn't neck-deep in hardware the way we tend to be in computer
        companies; he had to do a lot of scrounging to monitor the lines
        these hackers were using.

        He didn't do anything "brilliant" to track these guys down, no
        hashing, decrypting, creating data structures, inventing tools, or
        whatever.  He just noticed a discrepancy in the billing and
        followed up on it. Most of the reviews cast him as some kind of
        wizard, but technically speaking, what he did was basically
        system-manager stuff.  The important, rare, and amazing thing he

Subject: How to Make Pi Equal to Three

&gt;From the pages of the "American Mathematical Monthly", Feb. 1992,
comes a recipe that involves neither pseudoscientific trickery nor
legislative hairsplitting--just a simple solution that is merely
technologically infeasible at the present time...

                How to Make Pi Equal to Three

                        Rick Norwood

  Pi is equal to the quotient obtained when the distance around a
circle is divided by the distance across. For most circles, pi is
a little bit bigger than three. But, for spinning circles, the
Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction must be taken into account. Since
the circumference of a rotating circle lies in the direction of
motion, its length decreases as the rate of rotation increases.
Since the radius of a rotating circle lies perpendicular to the
direction of motion, its length remains constant. Therefore, as
the rate at which a circle rotates increases, pi decreases. A simple
calculation shows that, for a circle one meter in radius, rotation
at roughly ten million revolutions per second will bring about the
desired value for pi.

                                        Department of Mathematics
                                  East Tennessee State University
                                           Johnson City, TN 37614

P.S. Just imagine what would happen if some of those overambitious
legislators way down South got hold of this, and as a result made
the proclamation that all circular objects must be kept rotating
at such a speed as to keep reality in accordance with human law... ;-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        All right!  Listen up, Yankees!  The legislature that passed a law
        declaring pi=3 was a Yankee legislature, that of Indiana, which
        was also the only state legislature ever owned and operated by the
        Ku Klux Klan.  They don't call 'em Hoosiers for nothing.  I speak
        as a Purdue grad.

        known as the tax refund).

        The New Republic notes that the Bush administration wants nothing
        do do with Yeltsin because "he hasn't accomplished enough".  That
        is, being the first democratically elected leader of Russia in a
        thousand years, risking his life in the coup, dissolving the
        Soviet Union, and allowing prices to rise by twenty or thirty
        times just to get a capitalist economy going just aren't very
        impressive to a guy who's so bold he reduces our tax deductions
        without even being asked.

        Paul Tsongas, on the other had, wants us to take our medicine.  It
        will be good for us.  He seems to be the latter-day Milton Shapp,
        who ran for President (not very far) on the entirely sensible
        principle that he was better-qualified than anyone in the race
        (which Reagan won), or maybe Bruce Babbitt, who thought ideas
        could win the presidency, when in fact, *not* being named a dopey
        name like Babbitt could be much more important than any ideas he
        might have.

I was bored last week and a thought occured to me.  Why is it that there is a
government bureau which oversees alcohol, tobacco, and firearms?  I was bored
enough to call up the regional office of said bureau...  I asked the man who
answered the phone "What wine goes best with an M-16?"  He did his best to be
helpful, however.  "That depends.  What are you smoking?"

    Welcome to the WRITE_LOCKED conference.  Nothing is inappropriate for this
    conference, it's write locked.  Every note is write locked, every reply is
    hidden, the conference is write locked.

    Finally, you don't have to be tolerant, value differences, or be a team
    player.  Just be yourself.  And be paid for your performance.

    All conferences have rules, and this one is no exception.  We simply ask:

    1.  Be kind; rewind.

    2.  Close cover before striking.

    3.  Although this conference is write locked, we ask that you use mixed
        case.  Using all capital letters is annoying, even if it's an intention.

Don't forget to single out truly terrible R&amp;R anthems: "God Gave Rock
and Roll to You", to name the only one I haven't blocked out entirely.

And what about a "Songs That Couldn't Have Been Written by a White
Person" wing?  "She Was Checking Out as I Was Checking In", "Wang Dang
Doodle", and thousands of others.  Next door is the "Songs That No
Self-Respecting Black Person Would Have Written" complex, including
the complete works of Gilbert O'Sullivan and tens of thousands of
other drippy ditties.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Terrible anthem:  "We Built This City".

        Nonwhite songs:  Don Byas's tenor sax solo on "Harvard Blues"

        Whitebread songs:  "Rikki don't lose that number", "Hooray for
        Hazel"

        The complete works of Gilbert O'Sullivan may build white bodies
        twelve ways, but the Gil One successfully sued some rapper for
        sampling "Alone Again (Naturally)".  Someone else pointed out that
        Gilbert O'Sullivan himself had sampled his entire name from other
        performers.

Subj:   R&amp;R critic needs R&amp;R

One of the boys at the Globe -- Jim Sullivan, I think -- must be going
through male menopause.  First he whined about the presenters being
better than the inductees at this year's HOF ceremonies, then he took
the "con" position in the all-important "Nirvana: Threat or Menace?"
print debate that ran a couple of Sundays ago.  His argument was that
not only are the band's lyrics trite, but the singer mumbles so's you
can't even understand what he's saying!  (Like the old joke about the
woman reporting on her stay in the Catskills: "The food was terrible
-- pure poison -- and even worse, the portions were so small!")

I like the Nirvana songs they play on my radio.  What's wrong with
dumb lyrics you can't understand?  One of Elvis Costello's 80s albums
had reviewers falling all over themselves to compare E. C. to Cole
Porter, for crying out loud, but no one ever plays the songs, because
the tunes aren't red hot and blue.

The idea of a debate over whether Nirvana deserves its lofty status on
the charts is pretty silly, too.  The last big debate I remember was
in the 70s, when someone said everybody had to decide if "The Sultans
of Swing" was going to save R&amp;R or not.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Yes, right, the Globe is insufferable.  If Jim Sullivan actually
        thinks U2 is better than the least entry in the HOF (which is Bobby
        Darin, as you'll recall), why then, who cares what he thinks about
        anything?

        Nirvana's okay, but I think they're a great example of the
        lottery-winner.  One of those Seattle bands was going to break
        through sometime and somenow Nirvana  got picked.  Why not
        Mudhoney?  We'll never know.

        It's cool that trite lyrics and mumbling singers ain't out of
        style.  My brother Jim says rock&amp;roll is like Europa, that figure
        of mythology who was borne away by a heavenly white bull and who
        must, in order to retain her existence and meaning, touch solid
        earth from time to time.  This means too much U2 and your brain
        turns to mush, so keep it loud, rude and rowdy.

        As for SOS, it saved many a 4-minute slot that might otherwise have
        been occupied by something far worse.  Two songs I could listen to
        over and over, I'm surprised to say:  "Sultans of Swing" and "Walk
        of Life".  I'm not even tired of "Money for Nothing" (also known as
        Sting's greatest hit, and he is also known, by me, as Stink.)

Verbatim, from a Boston Globe article detailing product recalls
announced by the FDA:

        Dong-A-Food Corp. in Brooklyn, N.Y., recalled Salted
        Uneviscerated Yellow Croaker, a product of Korea.  The
        firm estimates that 71 cartons remain on the market in
        New York and New Jersey.  The croaker was recalled due
        to potential Clostridium botulinum.

Good thing that they found out quickly -- I'll bet that stuff just

Subj:   Desperado #3059:  Consider the Trebuchet as a See-Saw

Usually I find Desperado funny, but the business about toilet paper is just
plain stupid.  This whole business about which way to orient the roll was
resolved in Ann Landers/Dear Abby about 20 years ago:

        The roll is intended by the manufacturer to be installed so the
        pattern on it is visible.  Which means that the "over roll" is
        *correct*, not just some strange male idiosyncrasy.  The only
        modification that was deemed reasonable was due to the penchant for
        children and cats to pull the roll down, unrolling it onto the floor
        if it was installed in the *correct* position.  Then, for practical
        reasons, you should reverse it.  It is then ugly and foolish looking,
        but no worse than many other compromises one has to accept when
        keeping small animals around the house.

Some bozos objected to this, saying "Why do we have to accept what the
manufacturers intend?"  I'd like to see what direction those people drove
their cars.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Orientation of graphic elements in toilet paper isn't a high
        priority with me.  I notice that the *professional* roll mounters
        in this here software factory follow the roll-from-the-bottom
        algorithm.

        I usually take something with me to read, so it's not necessary to
        read what the British, I am reliably informed, call the "bog
        roll".

Subj:   toilet paper indeed!

Something tells me that you will receive quite a few responses to the
latest comment on front or back oriented toilet paper dispensing.

It is utterly unbelievable that toiler paper will unroll better or faster
when "front-oriented." The laws of physics are totally against you on this
one.

The reason that it is *better* to have TP front-oriented, is that you can
*find the end* easier.

Unless you are height-challenged to about 18", when a roll is back-oriented,
and the end is somewhere about midway down the roll, you haven't a clue
where the actual end is because you *can't see it!* So you end up rolling
the TP backwards and forwards attempting to find the end. Usually to the
refrain of "where is the ^(%^%#%#! end of the roll!!!"

If, said roll is front-oriented, then at any time, unless the end is caught
behind the roll due to an obstruction, you should be able to locate the end.
This is for rolls that are not in covered dispensers.

Perhaps, it is bacause more Women are height-challenged than Men, that they
can reach under and obtain the end more easily when the TP is back-oriented.

OR, perhaps Women do this just to antagonize the Men who forgot to put the
new roll on after using the last piece. And there's a running battle on
which orientation the TP will have.

If, as you said last issue, the reason was that TP is wasted, etc, I'd be the
first to change my ways. However, I have a sneaking suspicion you're wrong
here.

Front-oriented and Proud of it!
Ben

        The end being easier to find is an instantiation of the principle
        that it rolls off too fast when you load it over the top, as
        discussed below by top Open Software Foundation official Bob
        Mathews, who is married to an artist too.

Subj:   roll orientation

Your explanation of why some people hang toilet paper one way and some
the other has merit, but I believe it's more than a matter of
practicality; there's an aesthetic issue, too.  When the roll unwinds
from the back, the loose end is neatly tucked against the wall and in
fact may not be noticeable at all.  When the roll unwinds from the
front, the loose end is much more prominent.  Thus, the (excuse the
expression) anal personality prefers to unwind from the back.  I'll bet
that in the majority of middle-class suburban households the roll
unwinds from the back.  I'll go further and postulate that unwinding
from the back is positively correlated with use of air freshener and
coloring agents for water in the toilet.

Another possibility that occurred to me this morning is that a roll that
unwinds from the front is more suggestive of male genitalia, while a
roll that unwinds from the back is more suggestive of the female torso.
I'm not sure what implications this would have for male-female
preferences in roll orientation, though.

The Duke of Wellington wasn't bad at witticism in the old style, either,
as witness this earlier communique attributed to him.

   Gentlemen:

   Whilst marching to Portugal to a position which commands the
   approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have
   been diligently complying with your requests which have been
   sent by H.M.  ship from London to Lisbon and then by dispatch
   rider to our headquarters.

   We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,
   and all manner of sundry items for which his Majesty's Government
   holds me accountable.  I have dispatched reports on the character,
   wit and spleen of every officer.  Each item and every farthing has
   been accounted for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I
   beg you your indulgence.

   Unfortunately, the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains
   unaccounted for in one infantry batallion's petty cash and there
   has been a hideous confusion as to the number of jars of raspberry
   jam issued to one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western
   Spain.  This reprehensive carelessness may be related to the
   pressure of circumstance since we are at war with France, a fact
   that may come as a bit of a surprise to you gentlemen in Whitehall.

   This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request elucidation
   of my instructions from his Majesty's Government, so that I may
   better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains.
   I construe that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as
   given below.  I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability but
   I cannot do both:

   1.  To train an army of uniformed clerks in Spain for the benefit of
   the accountants and copy-boys in London, or perchance,

   2.  To see to it that the forces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain

   Your most obedient servant,
   Wellington

(Of course, such a memorandum, though enjoyable, can result in pyrrhic
victory.  Wellington pulled it off.  You or I might well be reprimanded,
permanently characterized as "insensitive" and "not a team player," and
subjected to quarterly audits to see if bread as well as jam were being
misappropriated.  Caveat scriptor.)

        Well, lots of music, a little Unix-bashing, a glinmer of SRL, news
        notes from all over, and the bog roll controversy is waxing
        predictably hot.

        It's a wrap.

        Yr. bdy,
        Tom Parmenter
