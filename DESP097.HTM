U.S. SAILOR HURLS SHEEP ORGANS TO WIN SCOTTISH COMPETITION

Associated Press
ECCLEFECHAN, Scotland -- An American sailor who surprised himself when
he won a traditional Scottish haggis-throwing contest credits his
baseball arm for his winning heave of a hard ball of compressed sheep
organs.
   Vernon Davidson, a 21-year-old petty officer from the U.S. naval
base at Edzell in Scotland, hurled the haggis 122 feet during the
annual contest last weekend in the little village of Ecclefechan,
beating haggis-throwers from Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales.
   His winning throw was 41 feet short of the world record set in 1981
by Alan Pettigrew, a Scotsman.
   "I've never tried anything like this before, but I guess my
baseball experience helped," Davidson, a native of Edwards, N.Y., said
yesterday.  "I was surprised when I won . . . It will be something to
tell the folks back home."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Don't let all that sheep-gut talk and throwing business fool you, haggis is
one damn fine foodstuff.  It's chopped organs mixed with oatmeal and pepper
and cooked in a stomach and consumed with whisky (the Scots term for Scotch
whiskey).  I've only had haggis once; it was brought back to the newspaper
office by a photographer who had covered some kind of displaced Scots orgy
in Chicago.  I haven't been able to convince Ann (the little woman) to make
me one, though she is a skilled cook.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: DOSADI::ARNOLD       "from the World of Micro-scum..."
To:   KERMIT::PARMENTER

Actually we microcoders have a more complex life cycle than just being alive
at  3 a.m. At the start of a project, we are often seen during the day, even
on  Mondays.  As  time  goes  on,  however, we become more morose and moody.
(Technically, this is known as "specification shock.") When we start coding,
we  retreat  into our cubicles, and sit for hours at a time, staring blankly
at  our  screens,  and mumbling to ourselves. This mumbling rises to audible
cursing  for  short  periods  after running the micro assembler. During this
time  our  hours  begin to "rotate," although slowly at first. Gradually, we
rise  later  and later, and stay correspondingly late. Sometimes during this
period,  we  may  even be seen during the day; but this is an illusion: even
though  we  appear  to  be walking around and drinking coffee, we are really
asleep.

Our cycle begins to peek when the first breadboards come back from the board
shop. Actually, this point is when the SECOND breadboards come back, because
the  board  shop  always  screws up the first ones. By then, our smiles have
disappeared  entirely,  generally  due  to  multiple revisions of all of our
specifications.  Then, of course, the dreaded debugging starts. This is when
we  become  truly  antisocial,  and  function only by moonlight. We start to
snarl  a  lot,  and colleagues are advised to be cautious, as a microcoder's
byte  can  be  nasty.  Anyone  who  receives  one  should get a tetanus shot
immediately.

After  several  months, depending upon how things are going, we may begin to
smile  a  little,  although  some people will think it looks like a demented
grin.  If  things  remain  on  schedule,  more  or less (usually less,) then
gradually  we  may be seen during the daylight hours, but we will still wear
sunglasses until we are acclimatized to the light.

This  cycle  remains basically true, even for those reformed microcoders who
now  write  firmware  in  Pascal. This goes to show that merely giving a new
language to savages won't civilize them.

I just wanted to put in my Niklaus Wirth.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I have been presented several times with the strange notion that
microcoding is 'not programming' and that it can't be done by programmers.
In fact, that's implicit in the last two paragraphs above.  Okay, so it's
not Pascal, but it sure looks like programming.  The hardware's only there
to make the 'software' work.  By 'software', I mean the *idea* of it all.  And
it seems that 'firmware' is a slipperier proposition than you'd think.  Why
should something be not hardware and not software?  I figure documentation
to be 'flatware' this standard.

I recently bought a micromputer game that is a simulation of Avalon Hill's
"StatisPro" baseball.  It was dusty, and on sale.  The result is that the
player roster is for the 1981 season.  I have broken the code of the
program and I know how to enter my own players, but I don't know where to
find the necessary stats on each player.  The Baseball Encyclopedia
currently on sale at Wordsworth does not include stats for 1983.  Can
anyone suggest any sources?

In case you're not familiar with StatisPro, the data  required  includes:
whether the batter is left- or right-handed, his batting record including
number of hits, doubles, triples, sacrifices, bunts, walks, strikesout,
times hit by pitched ball,  and outs.  Also needed is his base stealing
record, fielding record (in each position he plays), and an assessment of
his throwing arm (if a catcher or outfielder). For pitchers, StatisPro
wants information about what kind of hits a pitcher gives up, how much
stamina he has, and perhaps some other stuff.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
With all the data bases, and bulletin boards, and whatever, there ought to
be a source on-net somewhere for 1983.  Shoot, there ought to be a place
where you could get stats for 1984 as they happen.  I've never understood
why newspapers don't list batting and pitching records against lefties and
righties.  Switch hitters are listed both ways, but everybody ought to be.

Spring football.  Pfui.

        You don't need to say 'personhole', because it doesn't really
mean anything.  Neither did 'manhole', exactly.  The recommended term
is 'utility hole'!!!

On the subject of personhole covers:

 I also noticed (years ago) that Nashua had those (equilateral) triangular
covers.

 Circular covers are circular for a VERY IMPORTANT REASON! They are the
simplest geometrical and manufacturable shape for a cover such that under
NO CONDITIONS can the cover ever fall through the personhole.

        [Clearly, this is important only for the person in the
         aforementioned hole!]

 Upon noticing the triangular covers, I realized that this shape, too, has
that wonderful characteristic, although it would appear more
difficult to manufacture. (Maybe not, they're just castings, anyway.)
Note that squares, pentagons, etc, do not have the important property.

 Now comes the real question:

        Why Nashua?  Are they the pioneers of a new age in personhole covers?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I doubt if triangular covers are harder to cast, but circular covers are
always oriented correctly, where triangular covers might have to be turned
to fit back in the hole.

        Excerpts from   "High-Speed Management for the High-Tech Age."

                        by Susan Fraker
                        "Fortune" 5 March 1984

"All of a sudden, industrial products are like Hula-Hoops."  The
microcomputer was almost unheard of seven years ago.

  . . .

Dealing with these distortions has contorted many a company.
Within the last year Digital Equipment, Atari, and Texas
Instruments all had large, unexpected losses.

  . . .

Always the key is to move quickly.  Hewlett-Packard has every
division spend at least 40% of its time on short-term projects.
A short-term project used to be anything that could be completed
in three years; now it's defined as one that will take a year or
less.

Two Japanese electronics manufacturers, Matshushita and Casio,
have further refined the science of speedy product development.
After determining what their customers want and designing a
product, they prohibit major changes.  "An engineer can always
see improvements to make," says Robert J. Conrads, a partner in
the McKinsey &amp; Co. consulting firm.  "But it would delay
development to incorporate every new improvement.  The new ideas
can be included in the next generation."

  . . .

Companies with fewer resources than IBM should try especially
hard to be fast followers, however.  The advent of short life
cycles means that the big money is to be made quickly; a product
that arrives six months late could easily lose six months from
its payback period.  Digital Equipment and Data General, two of
the largest manufacturers of minicomputers, have both been
troubled by late products.

A related problem affects companies that announce products too
early.  Osborne Computer Corp. hit the jackpot with the first
portable computer.  But, predictably, other outfits began
introducing competing products.  To hang on to customers,
Osborne announced its second-generation portable long before the
company could ship it.  The strategy backfired when dealers
stopped buying the first machine to wait for the more advanced
version.  That created a cash flow crisis, and matters worsened
when the new machine turned out to be a disappointment.
Ultimately the company went under.

  . . .

"I would argue against trying to squeeze every last dollar out
of a winner," says Julien Phillips, a partner in the McKinsey
firm.  "It's more important to figure out what's going to
replace that winner."

  . . .

As growth takes off, for example, high-tech firms may need to
pick up marketing talent from consumer goods companies--as Apple,
Atari, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft have.  Personal-computer
technology is so widely available that marketing will play a
major role in determining who succeeds or fails.  According to
the former executive from Texas Instruments, TI's decision to
base its home computer division in lackluster Lubbock, Texas
(300 miles from Dallas), made it impossible to attract enough
marketing talent, not to mention skilled circuit designers and
software people.

  . . .

Companies that have mastered high-speed management try to keep
the mental light bulbs on by establishing small teams to design,
manufacture, and market new products.  Whatever they're
called--entrepreneurial groups, independent business units,
skunkworks--these teams remove the bureaucratic straitjacket
from product development.  Robert Conrads of McKinsey has found
that separate business units offer one of the best ways of
cutting product development time.  But he cautions that they
represent a major and potentially nervous-making departure from
the way things are usually done at large companies.  "It's so
easy for management to compromise and say, 'Let us do your
financial planning,' or 'Let's share engineers,'" he says.  To
be successful, independent business units must be small,
hardworking, and preferably located somewhere away from the
normal corporate premises.

  . . .

Microprocessors are at the heart not just of computers, but also
of some of the most advanced locks and ski bindings.  General
Motors claims to be the largest producer of microprocessors in
the world.
