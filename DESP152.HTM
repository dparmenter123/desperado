The following news item appeared in the 15 Sept 1986 issue of Digital Review,
roundabout from the 26 June 1985 issue of the Halifax Gazette.  But it is
RISKY enough to report here.

    EDINBURGH (Reuters) -- A robot dressed in a black hat and bow tie
    appeared in court on Tuesday after running amok in a restaurant
    where it was employed to serve wine.

         Within its first hour on the job, the secondhand robot became
    uncontrollable, knocking over furniture, frightening customers and
    spilling a glass of wine, the court was told.  The following day,
    the robot, exhibited Tuesday in the court, was still incapable of
    controlling the wine glasses, testimony said.  Eventually its head
    fell into a customer's lap.

A tipsy-turvy robot?  Did the firsthand know what the secondhand was doing?
Asimov's Nth Law of Robotics might read, "A robot must not spill wine on the
customers unless enforcing this Law would conflict with Laws 1,2, and 3."
But maybe the program instructed the robot to put on "glasses" (ambiguously)
so it could see better.  Punishment: Send the robot to a OENAL COLONY?

I quote verbatim and entirely without permission from the Datamation article:

*****

                BABBAGE - THE LANGUAGE OF THE FUTURE

There are few things in this business that are more fun than designing a new
computer language, and the very latest is Ada - the Department of Defense's
new supertoy.  Ada, as you know, has been designed to replace outmoded and
obsolete languages such as COBOL and FORTRAN.

The problem is that this cycle takes 20 to 30 years and doesn't start until
we're really convinced present languages are no good.  We can short-circuit
this process by starting on Ada's replacement right now.  Then, by the time we
decide Ada is obsolete, its replacement will be ready.

The new generation of language designers has taken to naming its brainchildren
after real people rather than resorting to the usual acronyms.  Pascal is
named after the first person to build a calculating machine, and Ada is named
after the first computer programmer.  As our namesake, we chose Charles
Babbage, who died in poverty while trying to finish building the first
computer.  The new language is thus named after the first systems designer to
go over budget and behind schedule.

Like Pascal, Ada uses "strong typing" to avoid errors caused by mixing data
types.  The designers of Babbage advocate "good typing" to avoid errors caused
by misspelling the words in your program.  Later versions of Babbage will also
allow "touch typing," which will fill a long-felt need.

Ada stresses the concept of software portability.  Babbage encourages hardware
portability.  After all, what good is a computer if you can't take it with
you?

It's a good sign if your language is sponsored by the government.  COBOL had
government backing, and Ada is being funded by the Department of Defense.
After much negotiation, the Department of Sanitation has agreed to sponsor
Babbage.

No subsets of Ada are allowed.  Babbage is just the opposite.  None of Babbage
is defined except its extensibility--each user must define his own version.
To end the debate of large languages versus small, Babbage allows each user to
make the language any size he wants.  Babbage is the ideal language for the
"me" generation.  The examples that follow will give some idea of what Babbage
looks like.

Structured languages banned GOTOs and multiway conditional branches by
replacing them with the simpler IF-THEN-ELSE structure.  Babbage has a number
of new conditional statements that act like termites in the structure of your
program:
WHAT IF--Used in simulation languages.  Branches before evaluating test
conditions.
OR ELSE--Conditional threat, as in: "Add these two numbers OR ELSE!"
WHY NOT?--Executes the code that follows in a devil-may-care fashion.
WHO ELSE?--Used for polling during I/O operations.
ELSEWHERE--This is where your program really is when you think it's here.
GOING GOING GONE--For writing unstructured programs.  Takes a random branch to
another part of your program.  Does the work of 10 GOTOs.

For years, programming languages have used "FOR," "DO UNTIL," "DO WHILE,"
etc., to mean "LOOP."  Continuing with this trend, Babbage offers the
following loop statements:
DON'T DO WHILE NOT--This loop is not executed if the test condition is not
false (or if it's Friday afternoon).
DIDN'T DO--This loop executes once and hides all traces.
CAN'T DO--This loop is pooped.
WON'T DO--The cpu halts because it doesn't like the code inside the loop.
Execution can be resumed by typing "May I" at the console.
MIGHT DO--Depends on how the cpu is feeling.  Executed if the cpu is "up," not
executed if the cpu is "down" or if its feelings have been hurt.
DO UNTO OTHERS--Used to write the main loop for timesharing systems so that
they will antagonize the users in a uniform manner.
DO-WAH--Used to write timing loops for computer-generated music (Rag Timing).

Every self-respecting structured language has a case statement to implement
multiway branching.  ALGOL offers an indexed case statement and Pascal has a
labeled case statement.  Not much of a choice.  Babbage offers a variety of
case statements:
The BRIEF CASE Statement--To encourage portable software.
The OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE Statement--No proof of correctness is necessary with
this one.
The IN-ANY-CASE Statement--This one always works.
The HOPELESS CASE Statement--This one never works.
The BASKET CASE Statement--A really hopeless case.

The Babbage Language Design Group is continually evaluating new features that
will keep its users from reaching any level of effectiveness.  For instance,
Babbage's designers are now considering the ALMOST EQUALS SIGN, used for
comparing two floating point numbers.  This new feature "takes the worry out
of being close."

As you can see, Babbage is still in its infancy.  The Babbage Language Design
Group is seeking suggestions for this powerful new language and as the sole
member of this group (all applications for membership will be accepted), I
call on the data processing community for help in making this dream a reality.

Can I say that Weekly World News gives...no, I suppose I can't,
but it is an interesting obsession. That is one newspaper I would
LOVE to work for. I wonder if they have David Byrne piped into the
newsroom? But I bet you have to listen to him through headphones
so as not to disturb the other writers. They do say the paper was
the seminal influence on Byrne's new movie, True Stories.

All right, that's enough, but I must tell you that last year, they
followed the story of a woman who was turning to STONE. No shit.

        Did you know:

        - One of eight Americans sleeps in the nude?

        - Michael Jackson was at the White House to promote an
        anti-drunken driving campaign and locked himself in a
        bathroom and refused to come out until the president personally
        asked him to?

        - Hundreds of field mice are leaping from Golan Heights in what
        Israeli scientists say is an instinctive solution to overpopulation?

        - There is no mold or mildew in Antarctica?

        Of course you didn't know any of that.  Neither did I until a
        publication called "View From The Ledge" arrived by mail the other
        day.

        "View," published by DEADFROMTHENECKUP Inc. in Washington, D.C.,
        is a newsletter that describes itself as a "Celebration of the
        Submainstream," which means that it is crammed full of little news
        items you likely won't find in your hometown newspaper.
        I'm not certain how I got on the "View" mailing list, but I'm
        most appreciative.  What this country needs is somebody out there
        to collect the outrageous and the unreasonable to keep the rest of
        us from going insane.

        Enough in the way of explanation.  Let us now celebrate with "View
        from the Ledge" and its news from the submainstream:

        -QUOTE:  "Nuclear war would really set back cable television."
                 -Ted Turner

        -FACT:  Rats rewarded in lab experiments hit the cocaine button
                2.5 times more than they hit the heroin button.

        -THERE GOES THE JUDGE:  A trial in Kenya was adjourned when a
                giant lizard invaded the courtroom.  While the bailiffs
                tried to kill the lizard, 20 defendants escaped.

        -CRIME NEWS:  A Tifton, Georgia, man was arrested for driving
                around nude and slinging lard at women.

        -DARN THE LUCK:  A Los Angeles robbery suspect broke into a
                building to hide.  It was the kennel of a training
                school for guard dogs.

        -ANOTHER FACT:  In 1895, there were only two cars in the state of
                Ohio.  They collided.

        If you are interested in receiving "View from the Ledge," the best
        idea is to write P.O. Box 57141, Washington, D.C. 20037.  If you
        want to contribute an item send it to the same address.

        Which reminds me:  A reader in San Francisco recently sent me the
        following item from the San Francisco Chronicle.  I quote directly:
        "KIDNAPPING:  A woman standing at the corner or Kearney Street and
        Broadway at 2 a.m. was forced into a man's car.  He drove her to
        his apartment where he forced her to wash the dishes."

                       UNRAVELING, ORGANICALLY

                           by K.B. Sherman

There are some events in life which distill with absolute, pure,
crystalline clarity into a decisive turning point. If you have one while
in college, count yourself lucky if you can learn from it.

Such a point occurred for me in organic chemistry lab at the beginning
of my sophomore year at college.

Organic chemistry is one of the Rites of Passage for the "pre-" majors:
pre-med, pre-dent, pre-vet. I wanted very much to become a veterinarian.
For the average "pre-" major, the beginning of the second year usually
involves the following fun-filled curriculum: Histology I; Celestial
Mechanics and Calculus II; Incomprehensible Foreign Language III;
Literature II ("A Review of 13th Century Morality Plays"); and Organic
Chemistry I. For those of you who have never been exposed to the
tortures of "organic," let me briefly explain. "Taking organic" involves
spending hundreds of hours in cramped, dank, decrepit labs -- always in
the basement of the chemistry building and always with the poorest
facilities. It involves dealing with countless vile chemical compounds
that have more "Cs" than a grand piano; that smell like burning feces;
and that are corrosive enough to dissolve diamonds -- and dreams. It
involves being hurled into a discipline that is as easy to understand as
the mind of a terrorist and even less forgiving. It involves spending
more hours in fruitless study than all your other homework combined. It
involves facing-up -- perhaps for the first time -- to one's
limitations.

The mind being what it is, denial comes early and dies hard. You at
first shrug-off the scores of 60% -- 45% -- 20% -- that return with your
first quizzes, heralding the degree of your failure. After all, the
course is on a "scale," so how bad could it be? But soon the evidence
becomes too damning to dismiss so lightly. And the final blow comes in
the lab:

                           EXPERIMENT 12

         "In this experiment, suffuloculating 2, 3, 7, diribonucleic
         deoxyflibonate will be produced from the effluvial
         redoxinization of bifurcating acidioloquatious 4, 8, 36,
         reframate and  parabenzabasiadoceous 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 44, 567,
         polyflorizatious disasterase."

Feeling the waters slowly rising above your head, you nonetheless roll
up your sleeves and plunge ahead...

After two weeks and twelve lab hours, you have turned both hands and
arms bright green, burned-off all the hair on the right side of your
head, and produced, in the bottom of your vial, approximately one-half
teaspoon of purple sludge that smells like the inside of a wino. Next,
through watering eyes, you read what you have to admit is the end of
your medical career:

         " Now, divide the 250 milliliters of your end result into 22
         equal portions, and perform the following experiments -- "

         * You fought the good fight, kid, but you lost. *

After this realization hits, you respond in a typical fashion for a
middle-class overachiever who has been the top student in his/her high
school biology class: you spend the next five weeks unable to eat or
sleep, having constant diarrhea, taking long nighttime walks down dark
roads, and talking to your desk.

Then, you change your major.

                      "P I R A T E S"  degrades women

To the Editor:

On Friday November 15, I attended a Wellesley College Theatre production of
Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.  Having never seen the play but
knowing that it was a huge hit on Broadway and is a movie as well, I thought
it would be interesting to see what was so great about it.  Although I thought
the production was carried out very well, this is no excuse for MISOGYNY at
Wellesley.  This was absolutely the most offensive play I have ever seen.

In the opening scene the pirates are joking about how undesirable Ruth, an old
woman, is: to her face, no less.  This woman is given to a young man who has
just been liberated from his career as a pirate.  The young man asks her
questions about how "good" she is in comparison with other women.  Later in
the play a group of young "maidens" are captured and told that they will be
married to a group of pirate men.  The women protest this by saying something
to the effect of "oh no!" while smiling and holding their captor's hands.
Later their father comes and the pirate captain tells the father that the
pirates are going to marry his daughters.  To this all the daughters respond
with a resounding coo "against our will."

Frederic, the main character, falls in love with Mabel, the heroine.  Later
Ruth, the old woman, comes back on the scene asking "what about me?"  Frederic
replies, "You have deceived me."  How has she deceived him?  Well she said
that she was a "fine woman" when obviously she just doesn't measure up to
the young maidens in beauty.

After this I had to leave.  I was so sickened to hear people laughing and
treating this horrible play as a comedy.  Society ridicules and dehumanizes
older women because they don't measure up to the 18-30 year old standard of
beauty.  Older women are actually harassed on the streets, today, and told
they are "Ugly Ugly Ugly."  It was horrifying to me that people were laughing
at this woman -- I wanted to cry.  Being raped or forced into marriage is not
funny either.  Female sexual slavery exists today.  Women are slaves of pimps,
pornographers, and of businessMEN who profit in the international trade in
women.  One out of four women in the U.S. is raped and it is against her will
and she does not coo about it.

I don't care if this play was written in 1879.  Everything that was considered
humor in it was somehow degrading to women.  In 10,000 years, when women
hopefully will be considered legitimate human beings, this play will not be
so funny.  The oppression of women in the past and now can never be viewed
as humorous.

SHAME ON YOU PAUL BARSTOW !!!!!!
