I brake for hallucinations.

Subject: Unbelievable statements (and associated Bottle Bill lies)

C'mon and grow up about that emotional bottle bill rhetoric. Taking
neither a pro nor con with this message, you can add the following
one-liner in support of the bottle bill to your list of unbelievable
statements:

        "Passage of the Bottle Bill will reduce your taxes by resulting
         in less litter along the road."

By the way, the compiled list sent around thus far has been really
impressive and imaginative..

Subject: An obvious truth

The following sentence has bothered me for years.

        "This show was filmed before a live studio audience."

Now of what use would a DEAD audience be?  (Or even a taped one?)

        I love the Boston Globe...  Where else could you read a line
   like "... will continue to experience profit pressures through the second
   quarter.".  What does it mean?  Does it mean we will see profits or, under
   all that pressure, see less profits?

Subject: SPRs

The best SPR I ever received said simply: "Never in 15 years have
I seen such a terrible piece of software."

My second favorite was: "FORTRAN doesn't work."

A friend of mine works for the State of Massachusetts.  Of course, they
use computers over there.  One day, there was a problem with the terminal
my friend uses, and he called up the computer center to report the
problem.  The computer center's response:  "Well, what do you want me to
do about it?"

On another occasion, very recently, my friend accidently managed to
break into a privileged account.  He called up the computer center to
let them know that it was very easy to break the security of the system,
and received this response, "For reasons which we don't have to explain,
this problem will not be fixed until after the elections."

I'd like to expand that list of radio stations it and mail it again.  So,
send in your favorite station's call letters, dial position, and a
25-characters-or-less characterization of its programming.

One of the reasons against moving to NH from Metroplitan Maynard is that
here in scenic Hudson, MA, the signal is so good from WAAF (Crank it Up)
107 FM in Worcester. Sorry not to have seen it listed ...

                DESPERADO PHILOSOPHY EXPOUNDED AGAIN

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Whereas, this is a short Desperado, and whereas there are a lot of new
subscribers, and whereas there's been some minor confusion, here's yet
another explanation of the life and times of DESPERADO.DIS.

First off, everything in between lines of vertical bars (ASCII octal
code 174) is supplied by the compiler, along with the headlines,
subject lines, and all the pretty decorations.

Except for submissions from node name NEMO::, everything else in
Desperado comes from the person who sent it, although I usually
correct spellings and grammar. Doesn't *anybody* know the difference
between it's and its?

Submissions from NEMO:: are anonymous.  Most are from people who don't
want their names published for whatever reason. Sometimes I decide
that your name should be left off for your own protection.

I don't forward everything that is sent in.  I rarely forward the
heavily forwarded stuff unless it's too good to pass up.  I often cut
submissions down, but I don't put words in your mouth.  I do save
everything interesting that comes my way, whether I forward it or not.
Information on these archives of network life is available on request.

Desperado started as a mailing for RSX writers four years ago.  There
are now about 170 people on the main list -- all by request -- and
an unknown number of forwardees.

Often rowdy, but never raw, when you come down to it, Desperado is
whatever I find amusing at the time.

PS -

Desperado is sent out via NMail, the most efficient and stable of the
various VMS command procedure mail hacks I have used.  NMail has 12
pages of clear documentation, but you don't even need the
documentation to use it once you're set up.  NMail is a
pseudo-store-and-forward system (stash-and-heave) so you should never
miss a Desperado mailing.  See SMAUG::PORTER for more on NMail.

Thanks also to DELPHI::MANN and STAR::GREEK for other hack mailers
from which NMail descended, and also to CASTOR::COVERT for the RSX Mail
that started it all.

Have an ice day.
