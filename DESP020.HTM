So far, no one has showed up to join me in flying the DEC flag at the
WBZ Test the Teams competition on December 5, which is this Sunday, in

Subject: HP outdoes IBM (And DEC?)

This came to me via a copy of a TWX today.

        As predicted for two years, HP announced its first 2-bit
        computer, an upward extension of its 98XX Series of single-user
        workstations.  This engineering/scientific series has generated
        1/3 of HP's computer revenues, about $600M in 1981.  Can someone
        in ESG or LDP place that Series in competetive context with DEC?

The typo is from the TWX, not mine...

My favorite error message comes to us courtesy of MODCOMP (Modular Computer
Systems, in Fort Lauderdale), where I used to work.  Their disc/tape copy
utility checks for collisions on the source and target tracks if copying
from/to disc, and if the exact same unit/cylinder/track limits are specified,
it says:

        COLLISION TRACK LIMITS

But that's not what it used to say.  The message used to be somewhat snappier
until one of their big customers complained.  What you got for that error was:

        WHAT THE F---?

Subject: Quotes

I was reading through some of the desperado mail (which I get second hand
from my wife; there are two Uhlers in the company).  Someone said that
one of their favorite messages from TOPS-20 was "Memory available-but not
for you".  It's actually an old TOPS-10 message, and the correct quote
is "Core available, but not to you".

Back in the good old days when we ran TOPS-10 from DECtapes and didn't
have paging hardware, the monitor gave that message when a user wanted
core (no MOS back then) and there was some available, but not in
contiguous chunks.  As far as I know, that message went away when
we got a processor with paging hardware and a monitor that ran from
disks.  If the person that reported the message actually saw it,
they've been around for a very long time!

Sounds almost like my favorite breakfast:  Quisp and Stout

Bells and whistles?  I don't know, I speculated about that one once.  You
see, down in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts there are some wonderful little
Victorian trinkets.  Among these are small silver whistles that have
handles carved from ivory, bone, wood, or other nice gummable material.
All of these whistles have a number of bells attached to them.  Fine for
keeping a baby amused.  Whistle and bells?

Or maybe it has something to do with the steam engine.

Subject: Bells, whistles, and CMS

'All the bells and whistles' is certainly not a DECism.  Anyone who
could think it was needs a looooong vacation.  I have always (semi-
consiously) associated it with steam locomotives, but it could be
steamships, I suppose.  The drummer analogy sounds dead wrong to me.

On another front, CMS (CONVERSATIONAL Monitor System) may provide a
"user interface that is the closest thing to an interactive programming
environment that IBM has", but it's no threat to Pro 350 (or anything
else).  For instance, each user is provided an environment of a Virtual
Machine, whose I/O to the rest of the world must pass through a Virtual
Card Reader/Punch with records in the image of an 80 column punched card.
The Virtual Machine is trying to provide the user with a simulation of
a nice, familiar, 60's style batch system.  No thanks.  In any case, I
have not used them, but have heard that some of IBM's more recent
timesharing systems are in fact substantially cleaner and more friendly.

Subject: No matter what country, everyone hates the phone company

                Robbers from the Post Office

                    Tens of thousands of
                   citizens suspect that
                     the Post Office is
                    collecting excessive
                     Telephone charges.
                 There are 150,000 sources
                  of error which can lead
                   to overcharges on the
                      telephone bill.

The monthly drawing is not public.  No official ensures that
the  device  is  in  proper  working  order.  The twenty-two
million participants may only hope that they won't be one of
the  losers in the great Telephone Fee Lottery at the German
Federal Post Office.

One of  the  unlucky  ones  is  insurance  salesman  Ingomar
Nitsche  in  Schwelm.   For  months  he got by for about 180
units at 23 Pfennig each.  "Then suddenly I had to  pay  for
564  units,  and  I  hadn't  used  the telphone anymore than
before," he said.

Things went  much  the  same  way  for  Irmhild  Pawalek  in
Ennepetal.   For  seven  years  the  thrifty housewife spent
about 45 Marks per month.  This summer the  state  telephone
company,  blessed  with  profits  in  the billions, suddenly
demanded ten times as much.  Frau Pawalek was said  to  have
telephoned away 461.45 Marks.

And Irmgard Fahrin, housewife in the Saarland,  upon  seeing
her  telephone bill this April, wondered if she had actually
"congratulated every monkey in Africa on Mothers'  Day."  In
any  case,  she  had no explanation for the 2058 units which
had been presented to her in the bill.

The three examples stand out from the tens of  thousands  of
citizens  who feel they have been hit up by the Post Office.
83,000 complaints from telephone customers were recorded  by
the  Federal  Postal  Ministry just last year.  Fully 23,000
times the yellow giant had to admit that it had snatched too
much from its customers.

Irmhild Pawalek got money back as well:  422.61 Marks.   The
Post   Office  explained  that  a  circuit  malfunction  was
present.   The  admission  came  late.    Three   complaints
remained  fruitless for some time.  Once the local paper had
reported  about  the  "Post  Office  Robbers"  an   official
arrived,  made  a  few  calls  from  Frau  Pawalek's set and
presented his employer with a certificate  of  good  health:
"Everything totally in order."

             Tough going for those who complain

Only after the Duesseldorf Consumer Center took up the  case
and brought influence to bear upon the responsible telephone
office in Hagen did the  Post  Office  agree  to  look  more
thoroughly into the matter and finally to give in.

Technical  malfunctions   and   human   error   during   fee
calculation  are  the order of the day in telephone offices.
The Dortmund  Area  Headquarters  admitted  that  there  are
150,000  possible  sources  of error.  The most common cause
are faulty connections in the lines and functional  failures
in the switching apparatus.

For example, upon overhearing the  conversation  of  another
user during a call, one must count on getting not only one's
own fees, but also the fee for the other call  slapped  onto
his  meter.   Technicians  speak in such cases of "Crosstalk
suppression".  The charge impulse from  one  timing  machine
can run up both message registers.

Overcharges can also come about if a  backhoe  runs  into  a
Post  Office  cable.  Then the charge impulse generator goes
crazy and annoys entire sections of town with extra charges.
The   most   common   indication  that  something  is  foul:
crackling during the connection.   Then  it  is  recommended
that one immediately interrupt the call and dial again.

A further failure can surface when  making  calls  to  other
countries.   As  soon  as  the  ringing of the desired party
begins in Denmark or Italy the charge impulses let loose.

This only becomes evident to an individual citizen  when  --
as  happened  to  Hamburg postal customer Ewald Steinhoff --
the counter turned completely around.  227,624 Marks and  18
Pfennig  was the amount the Hamburg Area Postal Headquarters
wanted from him.  This record-making failure cleared  itself
up rather rapidly.

But practically no one notices anything  if he  is  burdened
with  20 or 30 Marks too much.  The Union of Postal Users in
Offenbach presents a high figure.  It estimates that a  half
million  bills  containing  overcharges  are  sent to postal
customers each year.

Those who  complain  don't  have  an  easy  procedure.   The
disadvantaged customer, not the Post Office, must prove that
he kept his telephone calls short.  Even the courts  usually
start  by  assuming that the high telephone bill is correct.
As a rule, the Post Office need only claim that it found  no
technical  malfunctions  when reviewing the case.  The state
operation prefers to place blame for gigantic bills on third
parties:   "The  most common cases of presumable overcharges
can be  traced  back  to  secret  calls  made  by  children,
cleaning  ladies,  or  neighbors  who  had  the  key  to the
residence during a vacation."

There is something  in  that.   An  unguarded  and  unlocked
telephone  leads  to  toll  theft.  And the peace at home is
disturbed when suddenly the demand from the telephone office
is  higher  than  the  monthly rent payment.  But unlike the
case with the public utilities providing  electricity,  gas,
and water, the postal customer seldom has the opportunity to
check his usage on a tried and true meter.

The Post Office will,  indeed,  provide  sets  with  meters.
However,  what  is displayed on the meter is not accepted by
the Post Office as proof.  Manfred Bergman from the  Federal
Post  Ministry:   "These  meters  are  never  as good as the
meters in the local exchange."

Maybe they aren't good, but they are  expensive:   40  Marks
one-time  installation  charge  and then every month the toy
costs  another  5.70  Marks.   The  Union  of  Postal  Users
nonetheless  recommends  your  own  meter.  Director Wilhelm
Huebner recommends that in addition to  that,  every  single
telephone  call  and  the associated message units should be
noted in writing -- a piece of work that seems difficult  to
demand.   In court the postal customer still only has a real
chance when he can prove that a lock in the  dial  had  made
misuse impossible.

Customers who make  use  of  one  of  the  new  push  button
dialling  telephones  have tough luck.  These do not allow a
lock on the dial.  The monopoly at the Post Office, which is
currently  heavily  advertising these convenient push button
devices, is not only improving  its  profits,  but  is  also
improving its strong position of power against the users.

     Customers are made subjects of the State Monopoly

The cornerstone of the postal monopoly was laid in 1595.  In
that  year  Kaiser  Rudolf  II granted the Lord of Thurn and
Taxis the post of Head Postmaster-General.  What  the  Lords
of  Thurn  and Taxis once were, is today the Postal Minister
in  Bonn,  currently  Christian  Schwarz-Schilling  of   the
Christian   Democratic   Union,   who  replaced  the  Social
Democrats Gscheidle and Matthoefer.

As in the Age of  Empire,  the  citizens  are  not  seen  as
customers,  but  as subjects of the state monopoly.  Then as
well as today no prices are requested for  services,  rather
fees are "levied."

The citizen still can't simply buy  a  telephone;   he  must
"apply"  for one, and, if he is lucky, there will be no long
waiting time  before  one  is  loaned  to  him  to  be  used
carefully  and properly.  Only in the last few years has the
subscriber been able to choose from a variety of sets, at  a
higher price, it must be understood.

If the subscriber would like to have a  longer  cord,  maybe
because  his  chair is seven meters away from the connection
box, the accomodation  capability  of  the  Post  Office  is
already  exceeded:   It  cuts,  by maxim, only lengths of at
least three and at most six meters  from  its  cable  drums.
Seven meters are beyond the rules -- and cost extra.

If the telephone wants to ring, then it must be  allowed  to
do  so.   The  customer is forbidden by Postal-Edict to shut
off the bell if he would like to have some peace.  Those who
do  it  anyway  --  and  many  do -- run the danger that the
authority will shut off service.

"The right of the Post Office should stop outside the home"

One who has  fought  the  almighty  decrees  of  the  Yellow
Monopoly   for  years  is  Engineer  Ulrich  Jochimsen  from
Flensburg.  He was advisor to  three  Postal  Ministers  and
Director   of  a  scientific  institute  for  communications
technology and systems research.  Since  then  the  engineer
has  given  up on reforming the Post Office from the inside.
Because,  the  communications   expert   says,   "The   word
'monopoly' means single.  At the Post Office this has led to
single-mindedness."

The internationally trained specialist Joachimsen even  sees
an  unconstitutional  reach  into  the private sphere of the
citizen in the operation of the Postal Monopoly:  "The right
of  the  Post  Office  should  stop  outside  the home." The
monopoly  must  restrict  itself  to  the  installation  and
maintenance of a network.  The customer must have the right,
as in  other  countries,  to  connect  devices  of  his  own
choosing  at  the end of the line:  "After all, the electric
utilities don't have the idea  that  they  should  proscribe
which  television  set,  which toaster, which iron, or which
heating pad can be used."

Jochimsen:  "If the market were  opened  up  here  we  would
create  desperately  needed  jobs  and might also again gain
technical advantage over other countries."

What is presumed impossible in the Federal Republic has long
been standard practice in the USA -- to the advantage of the
customers.  There many private telephone  companies  compete
and  can  only  remain in the market through high standards.
So the telephone customers in New York obtain detailed bills
for  each  telephone  call.   Complaints  are,  as  a  rule,
acknowledged without bureaucratic problems.  Sets  with  all
technically   possible   finesse   are  available  in  every
department store.  Naturally the collect call, eliminated in
the  Federal  Republic,  is  available,  and at every street
corner there are telephone booths, at  which  one  can  also
receive calls.

Such a useful service is  unknown  here.   Ulrich  Jochimsen
believes  he  knows why:  "That is a remainder from the Nazi
era.  In that time the Gestapo wanted to  prevent  resisters
from  being  able  to  make  contact with each other without
being  overheard  or  identified."  In  Europe,   with   the
exception  of  the  Federal  Republic,  only  the  East Bloc
retains this principle.  The  Federal  Post  Office  argues:
"The  telephone  booths are there so that outgoing calls can
be made.  If one could dial them, they would be tied up." In
order  to eliminate growing criticism over their high-handed
customer tutelage, the Post Office has finally agreed to  at
least   start  a  trial  of  dialable  telephone  booths  in
Frankfurt.

There are other things the Federal Post  Office  could  also
learn  from  foreign  postal  authorities.   In Denmark, for
example,  overpayments  at  payphones  do  not   immediately
disappear,  never  to  be  seen again.  The device holds the
overpayment for further calls -- even for the next customer.
Here,  whoever  throws in a 1 Mark coin to make a 20 Pfennig
call hears his money rattle loudly, and then it's gone.

         Telephone rates support the letter service

This 500,000 man company is more inventive than  almost  any
other  undertaking  when  it comes to collecting money.  The
Post Office even levies fees for authorizing delayed payment
of  fees.   On  the  balance sheets all this looks good.  In
1981   the   Post   Office   took   altogether   more   than
24,000,000,000  Marks  from  its  customers and used that to
support other  services  which,  --  like  the  shipment  of
letters or packages -- regularly operate at a loss.

This year the income from telephone  charges  will  be  even
higher.   The  CDU/CSU,  which  protested loudly against the
last   rate   increase,   wanted   to   see   the    reduced
moonlight-tariff  for  calls after 10 PM reinstated, and did
not want to see the billions in profits  ooze  away  in  the
Federal budget, has suddenly changed its mind now that it is
in power.

The  new  Federal  Postal  Minister  Schwarz-Schilling   has
already  made firm plans for using up the expected increased
revenue and is leaving everything else in  addition  to  the
charges  the  same  as before.  Only one thing was promised:
Telephoning will not become more expensive -- at  least  not
until 1984.

COME BACK AS A DEC VAX-780-RUNNING BERKELEY UNIX." Go figure.

Hello Carol is an extremely hip strip, in some ways superior even to
Bloom County and Doonesbury.  The most obvious superiority is in the
graphics which is close to as good as it gets.  When Hello Carol first
appeared, it was a bit emotionally cold, but it has warmed up.
There's a regular set of characters, but there are also frequent
strips like the one quoted here.  The dialog is almost always
perfectly constructed.  Carol is a wry and beautiful unmarried
30-year-old.  Down the hall is Jeff, who is dying to fall in love, but
not with Carol because it would ruin their friendship.  Carol has
lived with men, and is currently falling in love with a friend of
Jeff's who just happened by.
