Dig the sacrilegious ad in _Digital_Review_:

                   If the Berlin Wall can come
                  down, shouldn't you be able to
                   get your DEC and IBM systems
                        to work together?

Such nonsense!  Everyone knows we need a new Evil Empire.  I think
 IBM would be an ideal choice.

Yesterday, I was reading an ad for Dodge trucks in Popular Mechanics, as I

based on test results of" (technical information left out because I dont

"Buckle up for safety, Nice magnifying glass."

It took me by surprise so I instantly started laughing, I was in a library

Anyone else read some interesting *fine print* lately?

       I just raced through "I'm With the Band: Confessions of a Groupie"
       by  Pamela des Barres, now partially married for nine years with a
       kid to some beautiful rocker named Michael des Barres who is
       thrilled by her decadent past.  It turns out she did not boff every
       rock star in sight, only the ones she loved.  Names, loved, or
       merely hung out with, include Chris Hillman, Mick Jagger, Keith
       Moon, Woody Allen, Don Johnson, Frank Zappa, Ray Davies, Howard
       Kaylan, the owner of Granny Takes a Trip, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant,
       Waylon Jennings, and a host of others.  All in all, a real hot
       ticket and a real piece of personal journalism.  Now in paperback.
       Ian Dury, author of "Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll" isn't in the
       book, but his song sure is.

       Cartoon from the Boston Herald:

       John Q. Citizen:  These kids with their sex and drugs and rock and
       rock and roll make me sick!  Whey can't they believe in the things
       we did?

       Response:  What was that?

       JQC:  Wine, women and song!

       "Rock", of course, is a euphemismo for "shag", while "roll" is a
       euphemismo for "do the horizontal bop".  As the immortal Coasters
       sang the words supplied by the immortal Jerry Lieber and Mike
       Stoller:

                You say our music's for the birds
                And you can't understand the words
                Well, honey if you did, you'd surely blow your lid
                Cause, baby that is rock and roll.

       Well then, somebody made a big mistake and read some of the words to
       Tipper (Over) Gore and now she's gone and really blown her lid.
       Every week there's another record-labelling stunt in the papers, so
       now, Tipper (you too, Al) this is mine, and it's for you.  I wanna
       see *everything* labelled.  Yep, every dad damn one of those dirty
       songs is gonna be labelled.Why limit labelling only to music that
       appeals to  people who are threatening to the middle class?  That
       is, to heavy metal and rap?

       This is how Missouri and Oklahoma would word a label:

          WARNING: may contain explicit lyrics descriptive of or advocating
          one or more of the following: nudity, satanism, suicide, sodomy,
          incest, bestiality, sadomasochism, adultery, murder, morbid
          violence or deviate sexual conduct in a violent context, or the
          illegal use of drugs or alcohol. PARENTAL ADVISORY.

       First up for labelling in my new repressive, restrictive global
       no-more-naughty-music schema: "Swan Lake", featuring man and bird in
       the Biblical sense.  Illegal under the sodomy statutes of most
       states, ostrich-hopping and all other avian sex is explicitly
       prohibited in Tennessee. the Gores' home state.  So, slap a label on
       that sucker.

       No adultery?  There goes both kinds of music, country *and*
       western.

       Puccini's "La Boheme" glorifies prostitution, drinking, and the
       wild side of life. The soppy fifties ballad "Teach Me Tonight" is
       about a female student seducing a male teacher.  "Sugar Walls" by
       Sheena Easton is about (well, mercy, I can't think of a "nice" way to
       put it).  "Rattlesnake Shake" and "Pump It Up", um, er, is THAT
       what "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" is about too?  If Elvis Presley
       sings "wear my ring around your neck, and tell the world you're
       mine by heck" he's offending feminists, using bad words, and,
       clearly implying that he's putting the wood to this gal.  "To Sir
       With Love", more student-teacher sex, interracial at that.  "Number
       47 said to Number 3, well you're the cutest jailbird I ever did
       see."  Label "Jailhouse Rock" as deviate sexual conduct in a violent
       context.

       Music is the fruit of love and love has a lot of sex in it and
       you're never going to keep it out.  Little Richard?  Are we going
       to label Little Richard and not label Willie Nelson and Julio
       Iglesias with their paean to promiscuity, "To All the Girls I've
       Ever Loved"?

       This St. Matthew Passion, Mr. Bach, just what is this all about?

       If every album containing "If I Could Be  With You One Hour Tonight"
       (to mention only one of a jillion salacious songs that even Jesse
       Helms can hum) were to be labelled as promoting sexual promiscuity,
       the whole labelling system would be 1) swamped and 2) laughed out of
       existence.

       "Five minutes more, give me five minutes more, let me lay, let
       me play, in your arms."  Mills Brothers, circa 1953.  Performed last
       week at Jesse Helms's country club.  Really! And indeed!

       The "Yellow Rose of Texas" commemorates an illicit romance between
       light-skinned and dark-skinned African-Americans.  Oh, Jesse!  David
       Seville's "The Witch Doctor", truly shocking.  "Ode to Billie Joe",
       say no more! "Heartbreak Hotel", more suicide.  Kids these days!
       "Running Bear", again suicide.

       The greatest campfire song of all time is either "Good Night, Irene"
       - sex fantasies and suicide - or "You Are My Sunshine" - sexual
       addiction.  "I Can't Help Myself", more of the same.  "Tom Dooley",
       the murderer.  "Along Comes Mary", Leonard Bernstein himself
       announced on national tv that this was about pot smoking. "Tequila".
       "Strangers in the Night", Frank and Nancy, promiscuous sex, not
       counting the father-daughter angle.  "My Prayer", sex and religion.
       "El Paso", sex and drugs and Mexican banditos.  "Stagger Lee",
       murder, in a bar at that, of the father of three little children and
       husband of a very sickly wife.  "Runaround Sue", "Baby Love", "Judy
       in Diguise (With Glasses)", sickening.  "Deep Purple" and "Purple
       Haze", drug songs both.

       But who knows for sure anyway?  When Little Richard said Long Tall
       Sally sure liked to ball, he meant, in the slang of his time, that
       she liked to go to parties (balls), not that she enthusiastically
       engaged in sexual congress.  But what does built for speed mean
       anyway?  And, was "Please, Please Me" really about oral sex?

       Labels, I want labels all over everything.  Label me.  Label me
       again.  Label every album containing the rhyme-pair "in your arms .
       . . all your charms".   Get those labels on everything.  And don't
       forget to label Captain Beefheart so he can reissue "Lick My Decals
       Off, Baby".

       Here's a little quote from The Pelican History of Music that I
       happen to have here:

       "The 'problem' Russian composer of this period was Alexander
       Skriabin . . . We rarely hear his symphonies, 'Satanic Poem', 'Poem
       of Ecstacy' . . . Like other unbalanced sensualists, Skriabin
       professed a pseudo-religion which  did some disservice to
       Theosophy.  He regarded the voluptuous and erotic as 'mystical' and
       called creative activity a 'religious observance'. . . for his last
       twenty years he was preoccupied by the occult - 'deep in it' . . ."
       One of his symphonies was written to be "accompanied  by the
       projection of a synthesis of colours and shapes on a cinema
       screen."  In  other words, a light show.  Sounds like he would have
       loved the 60s.  Sex, satanism, and symphonies.

       Two songs you used to hear out of the big baritones all the time:
       "Drink!  Drink!  Drink!" and "Donkey Serenade".  Dear me.  Are both
       of these from Sigmund Romberg's "Student Prince"?  Who cares?  Label
       'em anyway.

       Now we get to real opera.  I solicited some help on this cause I ain't
       no big-time opera man (except for Roy Orbison, of course).  I hope
       the people who shared their thoughts don't mind not getting
       credit:

       "Don Giovanni" -- glorifies sexual promiscuity
       "Magic Flute" - wierd rituals
       "Ring Cycle" - pagan rites
       "Mahagonny" - cynicism and promiscuity
       "Threepenny Opera" - promiscuity and cynicism
       "Carmina Burana" - glorifies love, lust, prostitution, drunkenness,
       military desertion, and gambling. (Cantata, not opera.)
       "The Tales of Hofmann" - "perverted" "love".
       "L'Elisir D'Amore" - Encourages drinking.
       "The Marriage of Figaro" - Depicts adultery.
       "Cosi Fan Tute" - Glorifies adultery.
       "Trouble in Tahiti" - Mocks the American Way Of Life.
       "Yeomen of the Guard" - Deception and fraud.
       "Falstaff" - Promiscuity with a capital 'P'.
       "Otello" - Murder of wife.
       "Medea" - Murder of children.
       "Kiss Me Kate" - Starvation of wife.
       "Company" - Sexual intercourse right on stage.
       "Der Freisch|tz" - satanism, attempted murder
       "Vanessa" - fornication, attempted suicide
       "Carmen" - fornication, onstage murder
       "Madama Butterfly" - fornication, desertion of mother and child
       "M. Butterfly" - same as above, plus transvestism
       "Tosca"- assassination, suicide, torture
       "Macbeth" - regicide
       "Un ballo in maschera" - assassination, witchcraft, conspiracy
       "Die Walkure" - adultery, incest, murder,paganism, child abuse
       "The Balcony" - prostitution and revolution
       "Lulu" - Prostitution, near-incest, near-incest again, lesbianism,
       adultery, brutal murder
       "Romeo and Juliet" - pre-marital sex, jealousy, adolescent
       rebellion, murder, suicide
       "West Side Story" - all that plus racial prejudice, gang fighting

       While I was still composing this opus some court in Jacksonville
       ruled against 2 Live Crew on the grounds that their music was dirty,
       rude, and of no quality.  I guess by that last exception the judges
       were trying to hang on to their filthy operas while denying the
       homeboys their street operas.

Subject:    RULES FOR BANK ROBBERS

  According to the FBI, most modern-day bank robberies are "unsophisticated
and unprofessional crimes," committed by young male repeat offenders who
apparently don't know the first thing about their business.  This information
was included in an interesting, amusing article titles "How  Not to Rob a Bank,"
by Tim Clark, which appeared in the 1987 edition of The Old Farmers Almanac.

  Clark reported that in spite of the widespread use of surveillance cameras,
76 percent of bank robbers use no disquise, 86 percent never study the bank
before robbing it, and 95 percent make no long-range plans for concealing the
loot.  Thus, he offered this advice to would-be bank robbers, along with
examples of what can happen if the rules aren't followed:

  1. Pick the right bank.  Clark advises that you don't follow the lead of the
fellow in Anaheim, Cal., who tried to hold up a bank that was no longer in
business and had no money.  On the other hand, you don't want to be too
familiar with the bank.  A California robber ran into his mother while making
his getaway.  She turned him in.

  2. Approach the right teller.  Granted, Clark says, this is harder to plan.
One teller in Springfield, Mass., followed the holdup man out of the bank and
down the street until she saw him go into a restaurant.  She hailed a passing
police car, and the police picked him up.  Another teller was given a holdup
note by a robber, and her father, who was next in line, wrestled the man to the
ground and sat on him until authorities arrived.

  3. Don't sign your demand note.  Demand notes have been written on the back
of a subpoena issued in the name of a bank robber in Pittsburgh, on an envelope
bearing the name and address of another in Detriot, and in East Hartford,
Conn., on the back of a withdrawal slip giving the robber's signature and
account number.

  4. Beware of dangerous vegetables.  A man in White Plains, N.Y., tried to
hold up a bank with a zucchini.  The police captured him at his house, where he
showed them his "weapon."

  5. Avoid being fussy.  A robber in Panorama City, Cal., gave a teller a note
saying, "I have a gun.  Give me all your twenties in this envelope."  The
teller said, "All I've got is two twenties."  The robber took them and left.

  6. Don't advertise.  A holdup man thought that if he smeared mercury ointment
on his face, it would make him invisible to the cameras.  Actually, it
accentuated his features, giving authorities a much clearer picture.  Bank
robbers in Minnesota and California tried to create a diversion by throwing
stolen money out of the windows of their cars.  They succeeded only in drawing
attention to themselves.

  7. Take right turns only.  Avoid the sad fate of the thieves in Florida who
took a wrong turn and ended up on the Homestead Air Force Base.  They drove up
to a military police guardhouse and, thinking it was a toolbooth, offered the
security men money.

  8. Provide your own transportation.  It is not clever to borrow the teller's
car, which she carefully described to police.  This resulted in the most
quickly solved bank robbery in the history of Pittsfield, Mass.

  9. Don't be too sensitive.  In these days of exploding dye packs, stuffing
tthe cash into your pants can lead to embarrassing stains, Clark points out,
not to mention severe burns in sensitive places--as bandits in San Diego and
Boston painfully discovered.

  10. Consider another line of work.  One nervous Newport, R.I., robber, while
trying to stuff his ill-gotten gains into his shirt pocket, shot himself in
the head and died instantly.  Then there was the case of the hopeful criminal
in Swansea, Mass., who, when the teller told him she had no money, fainted.
He was still unconscious when the police arrived.

  In view of such ineptitude, it is not surprising that in 1978 and 1979, for
example, federal and state officers made arrests in 69 percent of the bank
holdups reported.

Subj:   good filing systems

&gt;From _Murder_at_the_Gardner_, by Jane Langton

    Homer shut the drawers and looked around the room
vaguely, thinking about his own work space at home, his
own technique for storing documents.  There were any
number of good systems for controlling the supply of
paper that washed in and out of any normal scholarly
household.  One way was to simply pile everything in
separate heaps.  Homer subscribed to this school of
paper storage, although he knew it left something to
be desired--on his own desk the piles were always
drifting toward one another and mingling.  Homer also
prided himself on his file drawers, where everything
was carefully put away except for the great stack of
things that law on _top_ of the file drawers waiting
to be filed.  There was also a basket for stuff he
hadn't sorted yet, and several shelves for projects
begun but not yet finished, and notebooks of
miscellaneous scribbles, and heaps of drafts for
work-in-progress, and piles of fresh paper and folders
of Xeroxes, and works in manuscript by colleagues,
and a tin container for letters he had forgotten to
answer.  There was also a sofa in Homer's study with
a splendid long virgin surface on which to pile things,
and one mustn't forget the piano in the living room
and the top of the refrigerator in the kitchen.  The
floor was a last desperate resource, providing space
for orderly sortings in geometric rows.  You merely
had to step around the rows cautiously, or if that
was impossible, walk across them delicately on tiptoe.

There are actually only two stories that I remember as at all distinctive, but
I don't think them appropriate for this use. Still, they're worth sharing.

-There was a Diagnostic Programmer that took some sort of sick delight in
writing code that could cause physical damage to the equipment. Back then,
disk cabinets were the big 6 foot variety and they had 4 big RK disks with
large, heavy head positioners. Once he found out that the RK11 supported
overlapped seeks, he decided to see if he could find the cabinet's resonate
frequency with the disk head positioners. I walked in to find my RK cabinet
rocking back and forth, and if I didn't pull the plug I'm absolutely positive
it would have toppled over. I was not amused.

-When we first saw that people were sticking third party disks on our RK
controllers, someone in marketing asked if I could do something to prevent it.
I said I'd try and, after some chuckling, called them out to the lab for a
demo. I was able to modify our own drives such that the controller could
identify them. When it discovered a foreign drive, I made it switch on and
saturate a transistor which had a deliberately undersized resistor connected
to a source of power AND BURNED! It was all supposed to be a joke to watch
black smelly smoke pour out of the controller as soon as you hooked up a third
party disk. THEY were not amused......

Subject: Bic

        Remember when Bic lighters had that dial on them so you could adjust
the flame?  I would always take the metal clip off and turn the dial two
or three turns too far.  Then I would get a jet of flame about 6 to 8
inches long.  To my mind, this was the best thing about Bic lighters.
        So, last night I bought one and they no longer have the dial.  Other
than that, they look pretty much the same, so I thought I could just
shave off some of the plastic and it would give me a pleasant flame.
Well, it turns out this doesn't work.  I ended up taking off the entire
top assembly except for the metal tube that the gas comes out through.
Even then, they have some internal safty device to keep the flame small,
safe, and boring.
        I had pretty well ruined it as a lighter by then, so I lit it on the
stove and was going to let it burn until it ran out of gas.  Soon the
top had melted, enough that the butane could come out, and I got a flame
about six inches long.  This worried me, because I was holding it, so I
shook it out.
        Then I got curious and re-lit it on my stove again and put it into my
sink.  Well, it turned out that it was only a small leak at first.
Suddenly it melted through to the next layer, and it shot out a powerful
jet about the same length, but much more intense.  It also began flying
arround like a balloon you let go of.  Fortunatly, It didn't catch
anything of importance on fire.

Moral : Bic lighters can still be a lot of fun.

Subj:   Them bats is smart, they use radar

As promised, some additional info on the WWII incendiary bats:

The book "Celebrated American Caves" is an anthology of 24 articles on
a wide variety of topics concerning the great caves of the western
hemisphere.  It was first printed in 1955 by Rutgers University Press,
and was edited by Charles E. Mohr and Howard N. Sloane.  One article by Mohr
himself on bats and bat caves is titled "Bats and Bombs".  It contains about 6
pages describing an American military project of WWII to drop bat-carried
incendiary bombs on Japan.  A summary of the main points:

* "Dr L.S. Adams" conceived the idea of using bats to disperse incendiary
devices via plane-dropped bats upon hearing of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor on his car radio.  His inspiration was the nightly bat exodus from
Carlsbad Caverns he had recently witnessed.

* Adams lead an exploring team to survey bat populations to 1000 caves and
3000 mines.  The expedition took place at a breakneck pace.

* Scientists at UCLA, USC, Harvard and MIT discovered that bats have a
payload capacity of 3 times their own weight.  The species selected for
the project was the Free-tailed or Guano Bat (_Tadarida_), which weighs
1/3d of an ounce on average, but can carry a 1 oz bomb load.

* An accidental exposure to -10F temperatures during air shipment temporarily
froze (??) the bats, with no permanent harm.  This led to their storage in a
large refrigerated "artificial cave" at 40F.  This eliminated the need to feed
them, and simplified handling.

* The bats were loaded in special bomb-like containers for dispatch.  Each
container held 1000-5000 bats in cells resembling egg crates.  The bombs
were attached to the bats by a string terminated by a surgical clip attached
to the loose skin over the bat's chest.  Bomb attachment and container loading
took place in the refrigerator room.

* When the container was dropped from a bomber, it would descend by parachute
to 1000 feet, where it would open automatically and dump the bats out.
The bats would awaken during the parachute drop, and fly away seeking
shelter when released.  After crawling under the eaves of a house, etc.,
the bat would generally chew off the string connecting the bomb to a
surgical clip attached to their loose skin, and then wander away.  The
bats would scatter as much as 20 miles from ground zero before the bombs
went off.

* The bomb was activated by a timer (probably initiated when the container
was dropped?).  When it went off, it produced a 22" flame which burned
with an intense heat for 8 minutes.  (Whether or not this was napalm is
not discussed).

* 4 Texas caves with substantial Free-tailed Bat populations in
were leased by the Navy, and were guarded by Marines.  Ney and Bracken
Caves were prepared with capture screens in Oct-43.  The screens were
estimated to be able to capture at least a million bats per night if necessary.

* Effectiveness of the scheme was proved by testing on a dummy village built
in the desert, which was burned to the ground.  It was also proved by
the escape of some bats from a careless handler, who thought they "weren't
loaded".  The fires from the latter bats consumed most of an auxiliary air
base near Carlsbad, NM.

* The accident may have been the cause for the project being taken over
from the Army by the Navy.  It was then renamed "Operation X-Ray".
In Oct-44, the project was canceled after the expenditure of approximately
$2M on development.  The implication is that the imminent deployment of the
atomic bomb rendered it redundant.

This project was apparently discussed in _Life_ magazine after the war.

On a related topic, sometime in the past couple of years, I could swear that I
read that Japan had launched balloons bearing incendiary devices across the
Pacific, on prevailing westward winds.  I do not recall whether they were
launched from ships or from the home islands.  It was alleged that only a few
reached the US, and they merely caused some forest fires in Washington state,
but that this was kept secret during the war, lest civilian morale be hurt.

I cannot find the source of this story among the books which spring to my
eye this morning, and would welcome corroboration from fellow Desparadim.

    PORTLAND, Ore. (UPI) -- The chemistry class assignment: Demonstrate
the mushroom-shaped cloud of a nuclear explosion.
    Some students drew posters. Carl Podeyn and John Jubb wanted a more
realistic simulation, so they tried to blow up a turkey stuffed with
black powder.
    They should've stuck with the posters.
    Podeyn was hospitalized in fair condition Friday with burns
suffered Thursday night after the Sunset High School students tried to
set off the bird bomb with a match.
    The two 17-year-olds, planning to videotape their experiment, had
stuffed 5 1/2 to 6 pounds of black powder inside a raw turkey and then run
a trail of gasoline-soaked powder 30 feet from the bird to act as a
fuse, said Jeff Johnson of the Tualatin Valley Fire and Reascue.
    When they touched the fuse with a match, it flared into Podeyn's
face, Johnson said. Jubb was not injured, authorities said.
    The fuse fizzled and the bomb was a dud. But Johnson said the
Portland Bomb Squad was called to dispose of the turkey and its
unconventional stuffing. Bomb squad officers detonated the gobbler with
an electric fuse. The explosion shot meat and a plume of smoke 200 feet
in the air.

Resent-Comments: For the monitor technology fans among you

I had a chance to visit the big Sony monitor plant in San Diego yesterday.
Among other things, they manufacture a mondo 2000 line, 60 hz
non-interlaced, full color RGB monitor.  The flat faced screen measures 20
inches by 20 inches.  If monitor technology can be measured by cubic feet of
vacuum, this one is a "10".

This monitor is being primarily targeted at air traffic control, C**3,
shipboard contingency displays, mapping, VLSI design, etc.  Some of you may
have seen similar units at various trade shows in the last year or so.  The
ones I saw are the new revision and represent a significant step up in
sophistication.

Its pixel rate is 361 megapixels per second (about 2.8 nanoseconds per
tick)!  (The current version of the Photon cannot drive it.)  There are a
few display controllers designed for the beast, all of which are rather
expensive.  Some use gallium arsenide output sections.  Sony has a prototype
unit of their own (I saw a demo) which is an amazing piece of technology in
its own right.  More on that later.

The monitor has a built in calibration computer which uses a host of special
electrodes inside the shadow mask to sense the position and intensity of all
three electron beams in real time as they scan the inside of the tube.  The
computer corrects convergence, linearity, dynamic focus, color purity and so
forth.  There are no trimpots; the entire monitor is software controlled and
the adjustments are stored in EEPROMs.  Some of the adjustments do require
human intervention, though, because the monitor can't see the face of its
own tube.  When needed, it tells you to put this little probe on various
(highlighted) parts of its screen so it can do the right thing for you.

Anyway, one of the more interesting parts of the tour was the final QA and
calibration chamber, a cube about 20 feet on a side.  Surrounding the room
are a set of large coils which allow them to program the magnetic field in
the room to match that of a customer's site anywhere on earth.  This is done
on a per-monitor basis and is part of the final check out process.  They
said that the unit they showed me happened to be going to the MIT Media Lab
so the room was programmed to match the earth's magnetic field around
Boston!

BTW - They cost $40,000 each.

PS-

Regarding the Sony monitor I just sent mail about:

The total acceleration voltage is 30Kv from the cathode to the phosphor
over a total distance of about 24 inches of vacuum.  This is divided up
as:

Cathode Focus Grid, 10 KV over approximately 6 inches

Focus Grid Screen, another 20 KV over approximately another 18 inches

Question:

Assuming a new "pixel" shows up at the cathode every 2.8 nanoseconds,
and with the acceleration potentials described above, approximately how
many "pixels" are "in transit" between cathode and screen at any given
moment?

    The total acceleration voltage is 30Kv from the cathode to the phosphor

So v = 34% of the speed of light which is mildly relativistic but I will
get lazy and do the Newtonian calculation.

I get about 5 nsec from Cathode to Focus Grid and another 4 nsec to Screen.

        Dear Desperado,

        Events in Eastern Europe have us all watching, and I thought you
        might enjoy this item from a recent issue of the "Frankfurter
        Rundschau" on the recent first appearance of an anthology of
        Leon Trotsky's writings in the Soviet Union in 60 years.

        As many will know, Trotsky and Stalin were not the best of friends,
        and, largely as a result of Joe's diligent efforts, it has long
        been official Soviet historiographical policy not to even mention
        Trotsky's existence. (Actually, the German construction used is the
        untranslatable "totschweigen", one of those really telling
        constructions somewhat similar to, but by no means as gruesome as,
        the transitive use of the term "disappear" or of the noun "suicide"
        in recent South American and French leftist cant.) The article describes
        also the work of a number of recently emerged Soviet Trotsky
        scholars, including that of Alexei Kalaschow of the Nikolai
        Bucharin Foundation in the city of Nabarezhny Chelny.

        Here comes the nice bit: the article notes parenthetically that
        Nabarezhny Chelny used to be called "Brezhnev."

        .....

        Under the same rubric, it comes as no surprise to me that
        MacIntoshes don't promote literacy: a minimal literacy requirement
        is, after all, a design principle of that user interface. I think
        it is also interesting to note that the last major culture I can
        think of that was fundamentally based on iconology rather than
        typography was that of the medieval Catholic Church. Am I worried?
        You bet. In the meantime, I keep my powder dry by using a brand
        spanking new 386 clone as a personal machine. The only problem
        seems to be that system management chores leave little time for
        actually working in applications.

        With apologies in advance for the (likely wrong) Russian
        transliterations,

        I remain your companion in desperation,

        Will Kling

       Well, gosh, what *do* I say to a French lady when I want to discuss
       her upper underwear?  Strange, isn't it, that we have two words in
       English for that garment - brassiere and bandeau - both very French
       sounding to my Georgia ear and yet the frog-eating French have two
       compeletely different words, each even more French-sounding, and at
       least one of them mythical.  I wonder what the Belgians say?

Worse yet: according to a reference book I own (called "There is no
Zoo in Zoology), the word "lingerie" is not derived from any true
French word, and so the author feels that to pronounce it as it it
were French is bogus.  He suggests that the best pronunciation is
according to English rules (LIN-zher-ee), but recommends that you try
to avoid the word altogether.

Subj:   Re your mention of "More French undies (oo la la)"

I believe I understand the intended spirit of your "(oo la la)" in
this item; it's part of a consellation of cultural referents to a
prevelant, or once-prevelant, American stereotype about the French.  I
had assumed for years that this phrase was part of the whole
simple-minded stereotype.  So I was quite surprised when I first met
genuine French people (I didn't actually *see* them eating frogs but
they certainly seemed authentic) actually uttering the expression, in
the course of ordinary life.  The first few times, I wondered if they
were putting us on ("Ah, zee Americains, zey are such cheeldren..."),
but after several independent observations, I'm forced to conclude
that they really DO say that.  Life is full of surprises.

Subj:   euphemisms, etymology, foreign languages,...

And even if the etymology of the English word brassiere is pretty silly,
I for one would rather refer to "my bra" than to "my mammary-holder".
Accuracy is not always the best thing in the world.

********** If I remember my German correctly, their word for the euphemism in
question is "Bustenhalter". The translation is exactly what it sounds like.

******** The American word "halter", used for a bra worn as an outer garment,
may derive from the German word. Or maybe it derives from the word for an
article of horse apparel, a neck support?

***** A yes, the English versus the French. Reputedly the French refer to
condoms as "capon anglais" ("English hoods"), the English refer to them as
"French letters". Cambridge college students refer to them as "whitefish".
Think about that next time you are getting scrod.

Subj:   RE: DESPERADO 2030

About Avian Carriers:  During my recent sojourn in the British Isles, I saw
a television news piece about a businessman (an estate agent, if I remember
correctly) who is actually using carrier pigeons to communicate with folks
in a town where he does business, because his telephone system is abysmal.
He's hired a couple of children in the town to retrieve the pigeons and
deliver the messages.  Apparently the Avian Carrier system is working pretty
well...!

Ulp, it was "tendentious".  Try again.

"Dendritic", used about 18 inches back there, means "branching".

Subj:   A twosome of virginals, etc.

Anent the etymology of "pair of pants":  As I remember from my youth
when I wanted desperately to be a cowboy and got the duds to match,
"chaps" (no, not the Ralph Lauren kind :-) are actually two separate
leather leggings that folks pull onto their jeans, which deflect
tumbleweed, cacti, and whatever other detritus comes along out there
on the range...  And furthermore, you put on your chaps separately and
lace them together...  I assume they're referred to by proper-speaking
cowpokes as "mah pair o'chaps," or maybe "them thar pair o'chaps."

&gt;From a more cultured time in my life, studying Music I with G. Wallace
Woodworth, I also recall that there was a keyboard instrument in
15-16c(?) Europe known as the "virginal," because it was commonly
studied by young girls.  Lacking the mechanism of a plectrum, it
preceded the harpsichord.  I mention this because it was often
referred to in the music literature of the time as "a pair of
virginals" though I don't know exactly why.  Were they to be bought in
pairs and played while stacked one on the other?  Were they
manufactured in two parts and sold together in shrink-wrap?
Enquiring minds have probably forgotten... :-)

BTW, didja hear of the Siamese twins who moved to Boston from London
so that the other one could drive?

And so, we come to the end of another Friday afternoon and another
long-overdue Desperado with another heap of undigested desperation
mouldering away, some of it more than a month old, in my "nextdesp"
directory and another vain promise from me that "next time" it "won't take
so long" to "get it out", but gah, I don't know, gee, mumble, mumble,
there's some neat stuff in the next one an it's coming sooner than I think,
so I'll close with one last item, the name of a blues bar in Alaska,
