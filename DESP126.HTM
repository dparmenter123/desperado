Subj:   ice cream haunts....

        The ice cream debate between Burbeck's of Lowell and
        Kimball's of Westford may be academic.  I belive that
        Burbeck's was bought out by Kimball's several years ago.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
CROW::MCCARTHY has credentials on his side. He grew up in Lowell and went
to school there, thus spending his prime ice cream years in the immediate
vicinity of Burbeck's. Mind you, he has nothing but good to say about them,
but two branches of the same company do not a sizzling rivalry make.

Subj:   Another ice cream opinion

I have nothing against Kimball's either, but.......

Even when my family lived in Westford, we usually passed up Kimball's
in favor of Bedford Farms.

They have the "old New England ice cream stand" format, slightly
updated by coverting the left-hand third of the building into a
computer/video store.  You get your stuff through a sliding screen
window, and they don't do mix-ins like Steve's and the other urban-
derived stores.

It's a lot smaller than Kimball's (what isn't?), and you don't see
most people walking back to their cars with a sundae as big as their
head, like you do at Kimball's.

Their ice cream is an excellent balance of fresh dairy flavor,
just the right sweetness (not excessively sweet, like many other places),
and real flavoring ingredients (i.e., candied ginger in the ginger ice
cream).  This place has so much confidence in their quality that they
have actually offered PLAIN ice cream -- not "plain vanilla" but really
plain, without any vanilla -- and it was excellent.

Haven't had a bad flavor there, but ginger and pistachio come to mind
as particular favorites.

Location:  In Bedford, on Routes 4/225.  Heading west on 4/225 from
        Bedford center, it's on the left shortly after Route 62 forks off
        to the left, and slightly before Route 4 forks off to the right,
        across the street from a small Chrysler/Plymouth dealership.

                     Wild Pigs Threaten Scenic County

   SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) - Marauding packs of wild pigs that eat
``anything that can't get out of their way'' threaten the natural
beauty - not to mention the mellow ambiance - of this county north
of San Francisco, where the tusked beasts are reproducing rapidly.

   Although the wild boar is the second most popular game animal in
California, naturalists are bristling about the ferral pig's
virtual invasion into the scenic coastal countryside north of San
Francisco.

   ``They have arrived here in force,'' says Skip Schwartz,
naturalist at the 1,000-acre Audubon Canyon Ranch bird sanctuary
adjacent to the Bolinas Lagoon. ``Anything that can't get out of
their way gets eaten.''

   Since late last year, disturbing signs of the pig's presence
have been detected around the ranch and other somewhat secluded
pars of Marin County popular for recreation.

   Trails have been wrecked by pigs rooting for insects and bulbs,
snorting bands of them have charged at hikers and have been spotted
splashing in springs, and other animals' carcasses have been found
in their wake.

   No one seems to know how the beast got its foothold in the
county, but rangers for the Marin Municipal Water District have
been trapping and hunting boars since they appeared in July 1982,
threatening to pollute the water supply with their foraging habits.

   The creature came to the state in the 1920s when William
Randolph Hearst and others brought exotic European boars to breed
on their estates and the beasts mixed with existing ferral pigs,
says Fish and Game information officer Jack White.

   He and other rangers warn that once the pigs move in, they are
almost impossible to move out.

   That's not such bad news to people like Gernot Leitzinger, who
says customers at his Old Europe Restaurant in Pacific Grove are
pigging out on $15.95 servings of medallions of boar in cream
sauce, or cubed boar in onions, mushrooms and red wine at his Old
Europe: Restaurant in Pacific Grove.

   ``It's between pork and a little beefy,'' he says about the wild
pig's taste, which is very popular with diners.

****************************************
Subj:  User Protective Interfaces (UPI)
From:  John Lee Ellis
****************************************

INTRODUCTION -- USER INTERFACE REVISITED

The past ten years have seen approximately 70,600 man-years of
effort in the computer industry devoted to improving the User
Interface, and (as of June, 1984) about 988 doctoral theses on
the subject. Why is this? Because of the proliferation not only
of Computers, but of Computer-Users (formerly, Persons). A simple
Random Walk analysis of Computer vs. User populations, assuming
a Brownian motion model of User motion vs. a relatively static
model of Computer motion, predicts fairly frequent collisions
between Persons and Computers on a daily, or even hourly basis.

When these two entities collide, typically at the finger/keyboard
layers, untold reactions can occur. Most importantly, the user
has a distinct (though small) probability of typing in some
key-sequence which causes the computer to do something.

Most of the research into User Interface (UI) has been in the
direction of enabling the Computer to communicate its thoughts
more humanely to the User -- particularly in the area of giving
the User clues as to what he/she/it COULD type in to produce an
agreeable response from the Computer. This latter is termed
the User Friendly Interface (UFI) -- based on the theory that
a friendly User makes a happy Computer.

WHAT IS THE UPI?

The User Protective Interface (UPI) is the next step. The Computer
can do any of a myriad of things when told to do so. Moreover, the
Computer is just waiting to be told. Often the User does not know
the ramifications of seemingly innocuous key sequences, such as

   &gt; DELETE ALL FILES WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI

Early attempts at a UPI were simple prompts to the effect of

   &lt; CONFIRM Y/N (DEFAULT="YES") ?

The User Friendly Interface attempted to spruce up the prompts:

   &lt; PLEASE PRESS A KEY IF YOU WISH TO DO THIS THING _

At the present stage of computer advancement, there are more and
more of such interesting key-sequences possible. Research has shown
that there is a non-vanishing chance that such key-sequences WILL BE
entered, through such phenomena as

    o  user naivete',

    o  computer criminality,

    o  the Ape-with-Typewriter Effect.

(The most notable example of the latter in recent memory was not
the complete works of Shakespeare, but the accidental launching
of a first strike ICBM attack against Rangoon by a secretary who
was tapping his fingers absentmindedly on the numeric keypad while
waiting for a deli sandwich to be brought in.)

At the same time, Fifth Generation computer research allows us
to use Inferential Reasoning, Heuristic Methods, User Profiles,
and Hunch Hash Techniques to guard more sophisticatedly against
getting the computer to do something. These are the tools that
make up the UPI.

WHAT DOES A UPI DO?

A UPI is a rule-based symbiont that lives in the computer but
mediates between Computer and User, to protect all concerned from
User commands which could lead the Computer to perform dangerous,
overly-energetic, inadvisable, or impolite activities. To this end,
the UPI incorporates

   o  a User Profile for each user, including cumulative
      past behavior, aberrations, and pet phrases;

   o  a Command Profile, which rates the possible commands
      as to their impact, resource usage, probable duration,
      Catastrophe-Quotient, desirability, and niceness; this
      Command Profile is not just static, but relates to the
      context of What Is Going On Now;

   o  a What-Is-Going-On-Now data-base, which tells what the
      computer is doing, and how close to capacity it is working,
      as well as conditions in the outside world which might
      affect things, such as humidity (which can lead to irri-
      tability).

The UPI accepts commands, decides how advisable it is to do
them, and then coaches the User as to perhaps more correct
formalation of a given command, or, tactfully, what he/she/it
might want to do instead.

EXAMPLE -- THE UPI IN ACTION

Suppose we take the example of "Reading A Computer Mail Message."
The following is shown in dialogue form, although in real life
a Fifth Generation Computer would use mice, icons, pastels, bit
maps, graphics, Votrax, and Feelscreens to interact with the user.

Subj:   What is Colorado REALLY like????

(Copied from Aspen Airlines May/June 1985 in-flight magazine)

For as long as I can remember, people have been arguing about  whether
there was such as thing as "Springtime in the Rockies."

The evidence in favor of springtime seems fairly impressive at  first.
If  you  stay  up  late  enough to watch Ronald Reagan re-runs, you've
probably seen the movie "Springtime in the Rockies."  There's  an  old
song  of  the  same  name.   They wouldn't make movies and songs about
something that didn't exist, would they?

Well, never mind.  Science text books usually claim that  the  Rockies
are  in  the  North  Temperate  Zone, which has four seasons:  Summer,
Fall, Winter, and of course, Spring.  Spring, the explain, is a gentle
time.  The earth warms, lambs frolic in the greening fields, young men
coax young women into haylofts, etc.

Besides that, people in  the  mountains  sometimes  speak  of  spring:
"Come  spring,  I'm  going  to fix the roof," or "I'll pay up, just as
soon as it's Spring."

But if you listen closely, you'll notice that they're  always  talking
about things they never plan to do.  Saying "I'll do it in the Spring"
is merely a polite way to say "The roof is going to leak forever,"  or
"You can kiss your money good-bye."

In the view of the mountain dweller, there isn't  any  Spring.   There
isn't  any  Summer,  Fall,  or Winter, either.  Life in the Rockies is
divided into seasons, just as elsewhere in the North  Temperate  Zone,
but in the mountains, there are lots more than four seasons.

Starting about Memorial Day, it's  Tick  Season.   Woodticks  are  not
insects;  they're  related  to  spiders  and crabs.  They drink blood.
They lurk in bushes an jump onto passers-by, so they can  burrow  into
some  favored  dining  spot  with  quaint ambience - like an armpit or
crotch.  While gorging themselves, tick spread Tick  Fever  and  Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever.

As soon as it's safe to go outside in a T-shirt, Tick season gives way
to Tourist Season.  The formal start of Tourist Season occurs when the
first Kansas Winnebago loses its brakes on a nine  percent  downgrade.
Reservoirs  are  immediately  filled  with  boats and emptied of fish.
This lasts for several months.

Then it's Aspen Season.  Any decent eastern hardwood forest puts on  a
better show, with hundreds of hues; the Rocky Mountains offer xanthous
aspen leaves.  Nevermind; it's the only show in  town,  and  any  road
that  escaped  overcrowding during Tourist Season is sure to be packed
during Aspen Season.

A brief unnamed interval separates Aspen Season from  Hunting  Season.
This   gives  mountain  dwellers  time  to  gather  firewood.   It  is
theoretically possible to gather firewood during Hunting  Season,  but
it  is  not  prudent.   For  unknown  reasons,  the  State of Colorado
continues to issue hunting licenses to  people  who  cannot  tell  the
difference between and antlered elk and a human carrying a chainsaw.

Hunting Season, which keeps everyone indoors except  hunters,  extends
into  November,  which is the start of Ski Season.  Ski Season used to
have something to do with the cycles of  nature,  in  that  ski  areas
could  not open until sufficient snow had fallen from the sky.  Modern
technology has solved that minor problem; they can make snow  at  will
and  start  Ski Season pretty much at will and start Ski Season pretty
much when they want these days.  But old habits die hard, and  no  one
thinks of Ski Season starting in October, no matter how many lifts are
running before Halloween.  Ski Season gets going in late November, and
lasts until March or April or whenever people get tired of skiing.

Is it now time for Spring?  Not in the Rockies.  It's Mud Season.

Of all the times in the year when life seems intolerable,  Mud  Season
leads  the  list.   It's  do dismal that everyone with money or common
sense - and a lot of people who somehow manage without either  -  goes
to warm and sunny Mexico to sprawl on the beaches.

Those who remain suffer intensely from thirst and cabin fever.  They'd
at  least  like to get out and drink, but all the bar owners, with the
swollen profits of Ski Season, have closed their saloons and  fled  to
Cancun or Cozumel.

Leaving one's home during Mud Season is an ordeal.   As  the  snowpack
melts,  one's yard turns into an abyss of gumbo, capable of swallowing
small children whole.  Adults seldom disappear, but it often takes  an
exhausting half hour to slog through the twenty yards to the car.

Driving becomes an adventure.  A street that you swore was paved turns
out  to  be the consistency of quicksand.  Before you go a dozen feet,
every wheel can be buried to the hubs, and four-wheel-drive turns  out
to  be  useful  only in that you can now watch four wheels, instead of
two, spin helplessly and splatter everything within view.

Even if the road  is  safely  paved,  Mud  Season  remains  a  horror.
Everything  that  once  looked  solid  somehow  comes loose during Mud
Season.  Rockslides, earthslides,  and  mudslides  either  descend  on
roads  from above, or undercut them from below.  Your driveway, or any
other route you rely upon, generally  vanishes  for  at  leas  a  week
during Mud Season.

Perhaps the worst aspect of Mud Season is that you're never sure  it's
over.   It  can  start as early as March and last through Tick Season,
sometimes as far into Tourist Season as August if, as was the case  in
1984, the clouds insist on raining every afternoon.

Amid all this high-country gloom when the rest of the civilized  world
is  enjoying Spring, there is one ray of hope.  Winter used to be even
worse, until someone invented skiing.  Then all  that  snow  became  a
source of pleasure, rather than an infernal nuisance.  Somewhere there
must be someone clever enough to come up with a way to ski on mud,  or
sled on it, or do something besides sink in it and sear at it.

        A concrete pillbox, the Fortress of Solitude, or NORAD?
Someone mentioned Death Wish piano movers in the last issue. I hired them
several years ago to move a nine-foot grand piano I had just bought, from the
second floor of Old Cambridge Baptist Church to a truck on the street. Not
only do they all wear black T-shirts, they show up in a military personnel
truck with a canvas top and various ropes and equipment hanging up inside. In
my case, their job was to "float" (as they called it) the piano down a narrow
flight of stairs. It was quite spectacular to watch this; they photographed it
for their archives. What really impressed me was that the head guy remembered
this whole event several years later, and remarked that they have the pictures
on display in their office. I have never been to the office.

Subj:   How soon we forget

In response to a letter from an IBM person reminiscing about the
old ROSS text processor, that ran on the 7094 and later on the
360, the editor enlightens the reader as follows:

        For those of us not conversant in mainframe, the System/360
        was the first programmable processor.  It was the brainchild
        of the "Wise Men of the East" who worked at IBM in
        Poughkeepsie, New York.  The IBM 7094 was one of the PC's
        ancestors, with tubes and boards that had to be wired
        by hand.

For mistakes per paragraph in a computer publication, this must set
some kind of record.  I wonder if this guy understands PC's as well
as he understands "mainframes"?

Two hot news items: watch this space for the announcement of the spring
concert of the Spit Brook Singers, to take place June 20. Your editor
and various faithful correspondents will stand up in the front of Babbage
auditorium and make the welkin ring.

The next day, your genial proprietor is going to Europe for three weeks
to sing with the Nashua Choral Society, in Antwerp, Wales, and Winchester,
England, as well as a performance of Handel's Messiah in Strasbourg Cathedral.
I'd come home with a suitcase full of pate if I thought customs would let
me get away with it. Sophia Loren once made an entire movie about a gorgeous
Italian trying to get a Mortadella (a kind of sausage) into the States.
