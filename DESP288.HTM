Hi,

I can not let this go by without saying something about it.

No longer than four hundred years ago, I was in college.  At that time one of
the first computers I saw was a PDP-8/S.  Attached to it was an ASR-33.

Now for those of you who grew up in the age of workstations, or PCs, and have
never seen an ASR-33, let me tell you that you are blessed.  It was a beast,
stood about four foot high (measured from the floor) and basically did 5 (yes,
that was FIVE) characters per second.  Note that I said "characters per
second". This was so long ago that we did not even have "CPS", as TLAs had
not been invented yet.

The ASR-33 did upper case most of the time.  This is NOT because a lot of
Digital Managers were using it, but because it only understood something
called BAUDOT code, which was a five-bit code, and had to use a shift
character to shift between upper and lower case (with a different shift
character to shift between character and numeric mode.....don't ask about
upper case numerics....), so at 5 CHARACTERS PER SECOND it was a lot more
efficient just to stay in one case.

The ASR-33 also had a paper tape reader and punch.  Now in another time and
place I have eulogized over the death of DECtape, and my eulogy has been
written up in "Digital At Work: Snapshots From the First Thirty-Five Years",
as well as being highlighted in the computer museum down in Marlboro, and in
the computer museum in Australia, so I will not belabor the uselessness of
paper tape here.  But I will point out that (in addition to its slowness, noise
and frustration levels in usage), the little punches from the paper tape would
inevitably end up in your ham sandwich.

We suffered the use of the ASR-33 for many years, since we did not have
anything better.  After all, MicroSoft was still fifteen years in the future.
Then along came the TI Silent 700.

The first (to my knowledge) portable terminal, the Silent 700 used thermal
paper, and could do 30 (thirty) characters/sec.  Notice how we had advanced
by that time.  We had eliminated the word "per", and put in the slash, and
abbreviated "seconds".  This saved us seven keystrokes and (on the average)
five inches of thermal paper per year.  This was important, because not only
was the
thermal paper expensive, but it faded over time.  Therefore it was good to
do unfavorable job performance reviews and poor earnings reports on thermal
paper.  People fought to get the Silent 700s, because (among other nicities)
they were quiet and you could TAKE THEM TO YOUR DESK.

Now again, the concept of "taking the terminal to your desk" may be old hat
to some of you young whipper-snappers, but there was a time when the terminals
were kept in a TERMINAL ROOM, and you had to SIGN UP FOR TIME!!  The concept of
a terminal on everyone's desk was foreign, and quite frankly, who would have
wanted all those little paper punches falling into your coffee, as well
as your sandwich?

After a while, the Silent 700 was killed by a new concept, the CRT.  And one of
the leaders in that field was an upstart company called Digital Equipment
Corporation.  They had this wonderful terminal called the VT05.

Boxy looking, heavy and cumbersome, the VT05 did have several nice features:

        o it was quiet (no motor driving the print head or advancing paper)
        o it was inexpensive to operate (no paper to supply)
        o it had a printer port (to get hard-copy if you wished)

and a number of other features.

The VT series kept advancing, and Digital became the DEFACTO standard in
terminals.  I believe that it was in reference to the VT series that I first
heard the words "DEFACTO standard".  If you were not *VT* compatible, you were
sh......, well, you just did not sell very many terminals.

But the king (or queen, depending on your gender) of all was the VT100
terminal.  This was the star, and the terminal for all other terminals to be
measured by.

When I first ran into the VT100 I was working at Aetna Life and Casualty on
large IBM mainframes.  Since insurance companies are notoriously cheap
we *still* had the "terminal farm", but this time it was made up of
fifteen Lear-Siegler terminals and three VT100s.  Lear-Siegler made a "VT100
clone".  Or tried to.  They would always be breaking down.  The keys would
stick, the keys would double-strike, the tubes would burn out.  In short, the
"Blue Devils" (as they became known) were CR.......well, they weren't very
good.  And we lined up to use the three VT100s, rather than waste our time
trying to use the Devils.

Afterwards the VT series progressed even more, with a concept called
"cursor control", then "REGIS".  You could actually make simple designs
on a character cell terminal, and with low overhead of sending data down the
wire.  This was necessary, since although the VT terminals were capable of
thousands of CPS (yes, we finally made it), the modems of the day were still
at 10 Characters Per Second.  [Did you ever notice that the slower things are
the more you have to type?]

But years go by, and the character cell business slowed.  Everyone wanted
a graphics terminal on their desk, or a PC.  After all, it is hard to play
a decent game of Solitaire on a character-cell terminal.  And I guess it is
time that Digital sell this business, and put those resources into its
core competencies, whatever they may be.

Nevertheless, the VT100 terminal will always be fondly remembered by at least
one old programmer.

And I still have my copy of DECtape at home.

 Nice one, but I can't agree that the VT05's were "Boxy looking, heavy
 and cumbersome"; they looked like they came off the bridge of the
 Enterprise, Year One.

 The VT50s were horrible, all caps, twenty lines, with the
 'F'E'A'T'U'R'E of identifying lowercase letters by preceding them with
 'postrophes.

 The VT52's had the most wonderful bell (ASCII ctrl-G) in the world, a
 quiet little flutter consisting of eight quick clicks from the
 keyclicker thing.  (I reproduced the VT52 bell on my Lispm years
 later, pioneer audio programmer that I am.)

 Of course, the VT100s will live for many years.  My time-sharing
 system thinks my PC is a VT100 at this very moment and wouldn't have
 it any other way.

 Perhaps the strangest VT100 was the VT103, the first personal
 computer I ever saw, with 32K of memory, a Qbus, and a VLSI-11 chip
 (the details escape me) We actually ran RSX11M on it, multitasking,
 timesharing, ironclad, bulletproof, obsolete even then.
