      THE COMPUTER MUSEUM TO CELEBRATE
COBOL'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY WITH GRACE HOPPER

The Computer Museum will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the  creation
of  the computer language COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) with
a special program at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 16. Members of  CODASYL,
the  original  committee  that delevoped COBOL, will be at the museum to
share their reminiscenes of the COBOL project.

The CODASYL  Committee  members  who  will  be  at  the  museum  include
Commodore  Grace  M.  Hopper, the best known of the COBOL developers and
the oldest serving officer in the U.S. Naval  Reserve;  John  L.  Jones,
Vice  President  of  Norfolk  Southern Corp. and current chairman of the
CODASYL Executive Committee; Donald Nelson of Tandem Computers,  current
chairman  of the COBOL Committee; Oliver Smoot, Executive Vice President
of the Computer and Business Equipment  Manufacturers  Association;  Dr.
Jan  Prokop,  Vice  President  of McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, MA; and
Thomas Rice, Secretary of the CODASYL Executive Committee and a resident
of Quincy, MA.

The  CODASYL  members  will  also  present  the  museum  with  the COBOL
Tombstone.  In January of 1960, shortly after  COBOL  was  approved  for
publication, CODASYL Chairman Charles A. Phillips received a heavy crate
in his Pentagon office.  In it he found a small marble tombstone with  a
recumbant  lamb  on  top  and  engraved  with the word COBOL. Obviously,
someone thought that COBOL was a project that was "dead on arrival."  It
was  later  revealed  that  this  practical  joke  was perpetrated by an
employee of  IBM,  a  company  that  was  thriving  on  machine-specific
languages.  The  COBOL Tombstone will be added to the museum's extensive
collection of computing artifacts.

COBOL is the  most  commonly  used  programming  language  for  business
computing  today  and  was  the  first  language designed to work on any
computer, regardless of manufacturer. Previously, each machine  had  its
own programming language, which often created programming nightmares for
large organizations that used a  variety  of  computers.   Nevertheless,
many in the industry did not believe that a machine-independent language
would survive.

&gt;From its  inception,  COBOL  was  the  center  of  controversy.  Feature
articles on this revolutionary language apperaed in Time, Business Week,
Fortune, and the Wall Street Journal. A publication from the Association
for Computing Machinery likened COBOL to crabgrass -- no matter what you
did to it, it seemed to spring up again and spread.

Admission to The  Computer  Museum  and  the  COBOL's  25th  Anniversary
Celebration  is  $4 for adults; $2 for students and senior citizens; and
free for museum members. reserved seats are avalable for an addtional $2
in advance. The Computer Museum is located on Museum Wharf, 300 Congress
Street, Boston. The museum is open to the public from 11 a.m. to 6  p.m.
on  Wednesday,  Saturday,  and  Sunday,  and  from  11 a.m. to 9 p.m. on
Thursday and Friday. Admission is free after 6 p.m. on Friday  evenings.

Anyway, I though everyone would be interested in this.  I used to work
at this place, but programming PC's in BASIC got tiresome.

Any Questions?  Well, call them, not me.
