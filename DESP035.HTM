Before we get to the All-Robin issue, I should confirm your impression
that Desperado is serving as a test-bed for a new RSX mailing system.
This means some people got 33 copies of #1016 and some people got 0
copies.  Others got 1 copy.  Well, that's as may be.  I hope it all
gets straightened out someday, but as a partisan of network mail, I'm
willing to suffer a little to improve our new mail, which is destined
to be {ta-da!} *supported*!  As for the inaccessible note on the
Hewlett-Packard machine, it is now accessible as
KERMIT::DB2:[303,5]HP9000.TXT.  And now, on to the Robin. This is all
you'll see about Robin in Desperado, as other people have fine mailing
lists on the subject, details below.

Another rumor hits the dust.  I called the ROBIN people (Jim Kinland
at dtn278-4024).  They have checked with the finance people.  The
discount you get on your ROBIN is ***NOT*** going to show up on your
W2 form.

However

Don't rush your order in, now that your fears have been disproved.
They have stopped taking orders ... there are no more left.  Those
who have already ordered will receive notification in the next 3 weeks
as to whether or not there were still ROBINs left when they ordered.

LIFEBOAT supports software for the ROBIN. The questions to ask is whether
the particular application uses BIOS and BDOS calls only. They must have
a reasonable TPA size (most do) and also if they use other than VT100
Escape sequences....

Subject: PDT Floppy compatibility and CP/M software availibility

     Welcome to the wonderful world of Floppy Disk Incompatibility! Yes,
there is not a generally accepted 5.25" disk format. There are
incompatibilities in soft vs hard sectoring, track-per-inch, density of
recording, not to mention just general formating differences. This is
also true in the 8" double density world. I don't know what other systems
the Robin's drives are hardware compatible with, but I want to find out!
We should be able to write FLX-like utilities that can read other media
compatible disks.

     Just because we may not be able to exchange disks directly, does not
exclude us from the rest of the CP/M world. File exchange via the
communications ports is a viable way to get other CP/M software. I have
several file exchange programs for this purpose. You could down-load
files from other CP/M systems via dial-up lines or we could arrange a
local communications at 9600 baud with a cooperative CP/M system.

     I am the CP/M Users Group Chairman for the New England Computer
Society (NECS). I have 129 8" disks of public domain CP/M software. Some
of it is good, some is crummy, some is not interesting, But it is
availible for a copying fee of $1 a disk, you supply the media,
formatted. I will probably get a Robin, so I am interested in this
problem too. We could arrange a "copying spree" during which my archives
would be selectively copied to Robin disks. (Note an 8" disk can hold
214K bytes compared to the Robin's 180K bytes) This can be arranged in
the future. No individual requests now please.

     The NECS January meeting is this Wednesday, January 5th. The speaker
will be from Digital Research and will talk and probably give a demo on
the lastest release of CP/M, V3.0 and on the new Concurrent CP/M product.
NECS meetings are held in the Mitre Corp Cafeteria in Bedford, Mass at 7
pm. Mitre is on Rte 62 just east of Rte 3. Right next door to Crosby
Drive that our Bedford Training Center is on.

Subject: Transferring info from 8" to 5 1/4" diskettes

     I was recently asked about converting 8" CP/M disks to 5.25" RX180
CP/M disks by a professor at Brown University (I think) in Rhode Island.
I called the professor and got some more info. He already found a place
that will do the conversion. There are currently two places that will do
the conversion for a reasonable price. The places are:

        Standard Software
        Randolf, Mass.
        Cost:  Approx. $15 per disk

        Compuview
        Ann Arbor, Mich.
        Cost:  Approx. $20
        Note:  Compuview also has an EDT like editor called Vedit
                that runs on CP/M that is supposed to be a little
                more flexible than EDT in some functionality.  It
                is slightly limited in others.  It is a keypad
                editor though.

The places may also copy other formats... you should probably call one of
them first to find out.

Subject: Robin - Questions and Answers

What follows is a collection of thoughts and  observations  concerning
the  two  most  frequently  asked  question  about  the employee VT180
(Robin) offer.

1.  What software is available for it?

         Available from  the  Terminal  Product  Line,  is  the  'CP/M
    APPLICATIONS  SOFTWARE  REFERRAL  CATALOG.'  I  just  recieved  my
    "Summer edition 1982" copy.   This  catalog  contains  a  list  of
    around  100 software items available from a variety of vendors for
    the VT180.  Some of the  vendors  are  the  developers,  some  are
    clearing  houses.   Lifeboat  associates  is  among the list of 15
    vendors that apparently carry software for the  VT180.   Contained
    within catalog are a variety of language compilers including those
    for Cobol, Pascal, Fortran, Basic, ect.  Also listed are  numerous
    other   items  like  word-processing  packages,  data-base  stuff,
    accounting  stuff,  utilities,  ect.   These  software  items  are
    available directly from the vendor listed, at I presume list price
    (which by the way, for a language, is in the price range  of  what
    you  pay  for the VT100 Robin upgrade kit).  What you get for your
    money, is a VT180 compatible floppy containing  the  software  you
    bought,  and  the manual.  One interesting item that is available,
    is a ascii-port file tranfer package, for  communications  with  a
    Vax, PDP-11, or other CP/M machine.  Thats where the fun starts.

2.  What about compatibilty with other manufactures floppies?

         Doesn't look good.  But we don't seem to be any worse of than
    anybody else.  For some reason, every manufacturer of systems with
    5 1/4 floppies seems to enjoy inventing their own floppy  formats.
    When  you  order CP/M software from a software vendor, you specify
    which manufacturer's 5 1/4 format you want.  However, most sources
    of  CP/M  software  also distribute 8" single-sided-single-density
    floppies.  This appears to be the  default  distribution  standard
    for  CP/M!!!   In  theory,  we  can  read  these floppies into our
    PDTs/LSIs/VAX11/780s.  Also, if we were to connect  one  of  these
    DEC machines to our VT180 (ascii port connects, modem/phone lines,
    ect), we could transfer the files to our VT180s.  This of  course,
    would  require  special  sofware  at  both ends of the connection.
    I've been told that at least one of the  file  transfer  utilities
    available,  will  do  all  of  this  for  you.   Take  that with a
    grain-of-salt.  I have been told by a retailer  of  CP/M  systems,
    that  this  is  exactly  the  technique  they use for transporting
    software onto different systems.  At  any  rate,  with  the  hooks
    available,  the  prospects of tranferring outside CP/M software to
    our machines looks indeed bright.

     In summary there is no 5 1/4 industry standard for floppy  disks.
There  is  however,  enough software available from outside vendors to
make our little Robins quite useful (and expensive).   Also,  for  the
creative  types  among  us,  is  a  variety of means to get other CP/M
format files onto our systems.

     Whether or not it will run when we get it there is another story.
From  what  I  gather  (I no next to nothing about CP/M) the secret to
CP/M program transportabilty, is that the machine specific aspects  of
the  operating  system are contained within a ROM in the hardware.  If
the developer of a CP/M program uses these standard calls to  the  ROM
routines  to  do  his  I/O,  then  he  is  assured  a  good  level  of
transportabilty.   I  would  suspect  that  most  reputable   software
developers  do  indeed  make  use  of  this  standard interface to the
hardware.

Subject: RE: Desperado 1015 and the Robin

We (The Real Time Team,  COG) have been  providing  support  for  the  Robin
(VT180)  to  various  groups  within  DEC for a few months.  As part of this
support a Robin User Group has been formed.  I am including a  copy  of  the
message which was circulated within Parker Street concerning the User Group.
Please  include  it  in  desperado.   All  inquiries  should be addressed to
SHADOW::VT180USERS.  (You may also include all or part of  this  message  if
you wish.)

To answer some of the questions raised in desperado number  1015,   at  last
count  (the  count  was  made  by  several  software distributors) there are
approximately 6000 commercially produced packages  which  will  run  on  the
Robin.   Among  these  are  compilers  for  the  "popular" languages (Basic,
Fortran,  C,  Pascal,  PL/1),  several macro assemblers,  a large number  of
word processing packages (including the one which is formatting this message
as  I type),  a few data base management packages,  as well as several games
(including Chess and Othello).  In addition  there  are  at  least  as  many
public domain (free to anyone for the asking) programs available.

There exist several standardized file transfer programs which run on any 16,
32,  or 36 bit DEC system.  These are  almost  all  in  the  public  domain.
Several  public  domain  cross  assemblers  also  exist.  (A cross assmebler
allows you to write and assemble a program on your "real"  DEC  machine  and
transfer  the  assmebled  object code to your Robin to be loaded and run.) A
CP/M emulator also exists if you wish to debug the  program  on  the  larger
machine  before  transfering  it.   (Unfortunately  the  only really useable
version I have seen is not in the public domain.)

As you would expect,  many people have modified CP/M to make it  "more  user
friendly",   add  passwords,   etc.  Most of these modifications can also be
applied to the Robin.

Anyone interested in joining a Robin (VT180) User's Group please let me know
within the next couple of weeks.

The main goals of this group are:

        1. Exchange public domain software
        2. Exchange useful information concerning the hardware (the VT180)
        3. Obtain discounts when buying software packages (so far at
           least 2 vendors have expressed interest)
        4. General information exchange

We comunicate through a newsletter mailed on the E-net.  No  dues  or  other
requirements apply.

Subject:

This is FYI.  It is probably too big for inclusion in Desperado, but you
can hack it up a bit if you find any of it useful in deciding what to do
about the Robin offer.
                        &gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;*&lt;==&lt;&lt;&lt;

There is any amount of CP/M software out there that will run on the
Robin, but not much of it is from DEC.  I understand there will be a
"file transfer" program released later this year and I assume that means
transfer of files via modem, since CP/M comes with PIP.  All other
software has to come from outside sources, or is left as an exercise for
the user.

Lifeboat Assoc. in New York will sell you almost anything that has been
written for CP/M on VT18x format disks.  Remember, these guys are in it
for the money, and although the prices are much less than we charge for
software, the prices are VERY high for a private individual.

If you don't want to pay for software, or don't want to pay much, there
is a wealth of public domain CP/M software available from various
sources such as the CP/M Users Group.  The problem is that you then have
to find a way to get it on the Robin.  5-1/4 inch disks don't have a
standard format.  Much of the expensive commercial software (including
CP/M) is based on the free public domain software available from CPMUG.
This means with a little sweat, you can have programs as good or better
than the $n00+ variety sold by Lifeboat.

There is also a black market out there for stolen software.  People will
make up the $600 they paid for Wordstar by selling many copies to their
friends at $50 a shot.  Certainly no Desperado would deal with this sort
of slimy creature, being aware that their own livelihoods depend on
people who shell out $n,000 dollars for the stuff we sell.  I only
mention them so you'll know enough to turn them in to the people who are
being robbed by them.

Some kind souls have set up machines known as Community Bill Board
Systems (CBBS, of course.)  and very often they will arrange to transmit
public domain software via modem if you use a program that implements
their file transfer protocol.  (usually a trivial program that will
recieve N bytes then exchange cheksums with the CBBS machine.)  Probably
there is also at least one fanatic here at DEC who has 8-inch single
density floppies (the universal transfer medium for CP/M) who will
transfer files to 5-1/4 inch Robin format and start them moving around
for the user community.  It would probably be in everyone's best
interest to start a users group here at DEC, to encourage that sort of
thing.

Once you no longer have to worry about disk format, all CP/M software is
interchangeable. This sounds like a bold statement, but in fact CP/M is
a pretty limited system, with very few monitor commands (about five, I
think.)  All CP/M does is provide a standard interface to the
peripherals on a system. The operating system is incredibly primitive
compared to "real" operating systems running on big machines.

Back in the days when CP/M was starting out, it was referred to as "the
Software Bus" in that it was a common archetecture that would unite the
many different kinds of harware that were out there.  A hidden
implication of this is that most CP/M software is visually boring.
Since you can't be sure what kind of machine it will be running on, what
kind of terminal (if there is a terminal) will be used for display, how
much memory there will be, or what kind of disks the user has, you have
to write software for the plainest "vanilla" system you can think of.
No reverse vid, no double hight, blinking or bold.  Those have to be
added by the user.  (Another reason to have a users group.)

The corporate library carries several CP/M primers if you'd like to do
your homework.  If you are a systems type, they probably are not worth
buying, since the manuals that come with CP/M tell you everything you
need to know in a comfortingly cryptic style.  Magazines worth looking
at or subscribing to are: Lifelines, published by Lifeboat Assoc,
mentioned above, (They talk about the stuff they'd like to sell you, but
every issue has at leat one article of general interest to all CP/M
users.) and MICROSYSTEMS, Formerly S-100, formerly S-100 Microsystems
wich is a monthly that majors in CP/M with and S-100 bus machine minor.
(S-100 is a type of system bus. The Robin doesn't have one, but that
makes no difference to CP/M.)

A final thing to mention is that not only is the Robin obsolete
hardware, but the version of CP/M that it runs has just been superceded
also.  There is nothing in the new version (3.0) that justifies
replacing the version you get (2.2) right now, but you should be aware
that CP/M does change.

will reach him).  He has been working on VT180 programs for over a year,
and has lots of CP/M-to-20 stuff, which may also work on VAXen.
