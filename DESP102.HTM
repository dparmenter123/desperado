I need some help from a noble software engineer (is there any other
kind?) The April issue of our church newsletter tells about a project
going on in Dunbarton, NH, that I really want to help with. It's
called Project Rainbow, and the aim is to get a you-know-what and
software for the use of the local school superintendent and Vacation
Bible School coordinator. This would not ordinarily be something I'd
feel drawn to, but the woman involved is a quadriplegic, as a result
of a car accident. The church has already raised enough money to buy
her a Rainbow, and they're raising enough to buy the software, too --
CP/M and SELECT, among others.

But Laura Tucker is a quadriplegic, and can't press two keys at once,
which cuts her off from SHIFT and CONTROL functions. I've been in
contact with the folks involved, and I was wondering if any Desperado
had seen this particular problem addressed for a Rainbow, and had any
ideas about how to address it when the only Digital employee involved
is me, by no means a software engineer.

Can somebody out there help out? The church project has access to a
wizard who says he knows how to solve it if he can get sources, but I
don't feel I can promise that. This woman is so admirable, and I want
to help if I can. And one of the best resources I've got is Desperado.
Please contact me via ASGMKA::NEILSEN or DTN 884-2569. And thanks!

An Irish novelist named Christy Brown wrote a long book using only one
toe and a manual typewriter.  He had been paralyzed all his life, and
no, the story wasn't about being crippled.  Surely a Rainbow is some
kind of advance over an old Remington.

Obviously, a hardware solution is also acceptable.  One possible point
of attack is the LK201 keyboard.  If it is indeed completely mapped,
it ought to be possible to steal a key from somewhere else - F17
through F20 - to turn on caps and access CTRL characters.  I say this
knowing nothing about Rainbows or CP/M.  If you have any ideas on
this, you are obliged to share them, I think.

If computers really are universal machines like Alan Turing says, then
we ought to be able to do anything on any one of them.  If that's
true, then none of us has been in the business long enough and we
never will run out of things to do.

        I began to suspect a friend of mine had been in the business too
        long when he became convinced that a job advertised in the
        computer press which gave a salary of '10K pounds' a year would
        actually result in '10240 pounds' a year.

        I'm still not sure whether he had a point or not and THAT is what
        worries me!!

Back in the dark ages, when I was writing COBOL for a Univac Spectra 70 (nee
RCA) in Chicago, the ace on the EDP staff was a fellow named Jim Gazzoli. I
forget if we called them abends or dumps, but if your program crapped out, Jim
was the person to bring in.

Jim was balancing the family checkbook once when he wife looked over his
shoulder and saw things like "5D1" in the balance column.  She asked what in
the world he was doing.

He was subtracting in hex, of course.

I don't know if I've been in THIS business too long. I dream about all kinds
of obsessive things. This week, for example, I sang the entire Durufle
Requiem in my sleep twice, including the baritone solos, following two
marathon rehearsals for the Nashua Choral Society's performance of that
splendid work on Saturday. And a splendid performance it was, although I
confined myself to the alto parts.

But obsessive behavior of the type you are looking for is also one of my
fortes. Following a nightmarish two months of debugging some vintage
spaghetti, I finally got to the point where I could run the production job
that used this code. You can imagine the state the system was in, if a
critical production job had been unable to run for two months. You can
imagine the state I was in if I had been trying to make it run for two months.
You can imagine the state I was in after looking at the kind of code that
takes two months to debug. (Somebody invoke the Mann Act.) But anyway! The
night my poor system was finally gittin' it, I dreamed I was the
program under discussion, and executed each and every line of that code
for each and every record, personally lifting and carrying each record and
putting it on some sort of virtual shelf. But the job ran successfully that
night and ever since.

        "Celebrants of this year's Passover can enjoy a new touch,"
says FORBES magazine (April 9, 1984). No, not the angel of death:
"games for their home computers.  The  lineup includes  How to Conduct
a Seder; All About Passover (an account of the Exodus); Jewish
Compu-Chef, a 200-recipe cookbook; Afikoman Adventure (based on the
seder's hide-the-matzoh children's game); Crumb Eater and Crumb
Chaser, both derived from the ritual Passover house cleaning. The
games are a product of the 3 1/2-year old  Institute for Computers in
Jewish Life, a nonprofit group linked to Israel's Bar Ilan Univrsity,
that works up software on the Bible, the Hebrew  language, and similar
topics. Chicago's  Davka Corp. (*Davka* is Hebrew for 'exact,'  to
stress the computer tie-in) sells the $25-$35 games."

        I have a hunch that future games include:

        o VISIGUILT

A Guide for Parents on How to Make Your Son or Daughter Feel REALLY Guilty

        o PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE

Planning and excuting air strikes against Iraqi nuclear facilities

hostages from terrorists, and calculating the inflation rate of the

Geoff's mail quote, "Grub first, then ethics", is one of my old faves
from Bert Brecht, who said "Erst kommt das Fressen, dann kommt die
Moral."  It is a line in the "Threepenny Opera".  I have been trying
to translate it ever since.  My version is "Feed us first and then
we'll be good."  Another version of the same idea:  "The average man
is only nine meals away from revolution."

Re:  Special export restriction on DEC:  This got discussed in the NY Times a
couple of weeks ago.  It seems that we just lucked out on the timing:  Commerce
gives out licenses for a fixed period of time (2 years?) and ours happened to
come up for renewal just after the VAX incidents.  There is no evidence that
Commerce means to single us out; however, no other major manufacturer has come
up for renewal recently.  The feeling observers had is that the same restric-
tions will be applied to everyone else as their renewal time comes up.  (I think
IBM is next, but I don't remember when).

Is it really possible to keep the Russians from getting VAXes?  The
Swedes may stop them, but there are 135 sovereign states and not all
of them are western democracies sharing a border with the Soviet
Union.  And, for that matter, what's to stop Nixdorf or Siemens or
Honeywell-Bull (sic) from selling them computers? Just askin'.

Subject: Nuclear protesters hope troops can't resist marijuana

Reuters WOENSDRECHT, Netherlands -- Dutch antinuclear protestors yesterday
sowed marijuana seeds around the 11-mile perimeter fence of an airbase here,
which officials have earmarked for the possible siting of US cruise nuclear
missiles.

Police said two dozen members of a group, calling itself Dutch Cannabis
Against Cruise Missiles Campaign, planted 72 pounds of seeds outside the
barbed-wire fence and used blowpipes to spread the seeds to places they
could not reach.

The airbase guards did not try to stop the protesters, police said, and
there were no incidents.

A spokesman for the group said its action was linked to recent disciplinary
action against seven US Air Force servicemen in Britain for allegedly
smoking marijuana.

"We hope that with so many marijuana plants here the military guards will
later be unable to resist the temptation and get sent home," the spokesman
said.

        Recently, I'm told, IBM found that their manufacturing
capacity was not going to be able to produce 100,000 transistors that
was needed for a new personal computer.  They would have to turn to an
outside source for this supply.  They selected a highly reputable,
quality conscious Japanese company.

        During their negotiations, IBM told this Japanese company that
their AQL (Acceptable Quality Level) was 95% -- they would accept 5
parts per hundred as defective.  The Japanese couldn't quite
comprehend this, but as dedicated vendors, they attempted to comply.

        IBM received their shipment in two packages, a large and a
small.  An accompanying invoice explained that, to make it easier for
them, the large package contains the 95,000 good transistors and the
small package contains, you guessed it, the 5000 defective
transistors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
First, a little bit about a rival electronic rag, the Assabet Inquirer
(AI, ho-ho).  It's published by CRLF::CERVA and is 'a hodge podge of
old and new items'.  Current issue is Volume 2 #3 and it's pretty
interesting.  It's mostly press clippings.  Current promotion in AI is
for a company song for DEC.  Sample verse from one entry:

                New I/O devices our micros will house,
                We may even have our own mini mouse.

Another song:

                Let's get DIGITAL!

Really, it's not bad.  Send your song-poems to CRLF::CERVA.

Following are one set of suggestions for an intelligent net and two
corrections of my statement that no DEC mail could store and forward.
So I was wrong, but I still say that neither the current or future VMS
mail, nor the current RSTS mail and future RSX mail can store and
forward and if those aren't corporately anointed mail systems, I'm a
triangular manhole cover.

On my VAX at the Mill, sending mail to a list ties up your terminal
for as long as it takes to poll all of the nodes and then mail as much
mail as it can manage to shove out, whereupon you have to write down
all the names of those who didn't get it and make a new list to send
to.  Sometimes you get messages back that some intervening node is
down and you never have an idea who didn't get it.

I'd like to be able to specify a priority when I send or read mail.

E.G.    URGENT  - notifies the user that he has an urgent message even if
                breakthrough write is disabled.

        NORMAL  - broadcasts only if breakthrough is enabled

        LOW/FYI - no broadcast

Upon reading MAIL, URGENT messages should be listed first, followed by normal
and then FYI types.

Also, all MAIL systems should store and forward by default.

SEND/ACKNOWLEDGE would tell me if a message is being stored for forwarding later
and reply with an acknowledgement when delivered to the user.  I guess it's
too much to ask for an acknowledgement when the user actually reads it.

DIRECTORY/SINCE[=TODAY, YESTERDAY, LAST, time] might also be useful.

Let me be the first of many who respond that DEC's "official corporate mail
system" does indeed support such things as store and forward, routing, priority
mail, etc.  However, VMS added their hack mail to their kit and only years
later will it be possible to send mail from VMS mail to the corporate mail
system.  The reverse has been possible for years.  Note that the corporate
mail system has several user interfaces, (the VMS mail system has only
one and allows only one).  The transport of messages is handled by the Message
Router which has a well defined interface.  The user interfaces include DMAIL,
and several from the various "office" products including ALL-IN-1.  EMS is
being replaced by MTS which uses the MR and ALL-IN-1.

**** Your Text ****
One of the simple pleasures that hacker mail systems like NMail and
the RSX mail that I use for Desperado is that they are capable of
storing and forwarding mail, something none of the corporately
anointed mail systems do.
*******************

In fact, Digital does have "corporately anointed mail systems" that are
"capable of storing and forwarding mail". DECmail V2.x is such a system
since it uses the Message Router for off-node deliveries and Message Router
(a product) is among other things a "store and forward" MTS. ALL-IN-1 CMI
mail can be interfaced to Message Router in ALL-IN-1 V1.x and DECmail+
(which is really CMI V2.0) will use Message Router in ALL-IN-1 V2.x!

You don't have to be a "hacker" to get store and forward...

                bob wyman

This message was sent using ALL-IN-1 CMI mail interfaced to the Message Router
and then redirecting back out to VMSmail using the Message Router VMSmail
Gateway.
