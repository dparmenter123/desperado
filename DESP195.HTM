    More China news:  The Walker Center for Ecumenical Exchange is still
    the leading node for communication among Chinese students in the United
    States.  There are two ways to contribute to their work.  One is to
    support the Democracy for China Fund, c/o Bank of Boston, Box 151,
    Boston, Mass. 02101.  The other is to buy one of their exclusive
    T-shirts showing the lone Chinese student confronting the tank by
    sending $10 directly to the Walker Center for Ecumenical Exchange, 144
    Hancock Street, Auburndale, Mass. 02166.

    popular "almond" is as an appliance color and how "platinum" was ahead
    of its time and whether "toast" or "sand" was a better name for another
    new color and all about the philosophy of appliance colors, as
    explained by Robert Mundt, Manager, Design Systems, General Electric:
    "What you think about an applicance color is partly determined by what
    you think about your kitchen and what you think about your kitchen is

    This is the first edition since Christmas.  We gave a block party this

    year's charity was "the homeless" and the Yankee banker immediately
    challenged the carollers to prove to him that the homeless really
    existed and weren't just a media hype.  The kids were bumfuzzled, his
    wife told him to be quiet, and finally the banker kicked in $5.  What's

Subj:   "octothorpe"???

&gt;From the recently-distributed memo from the ZK Telecommunications dept:

&gt;       Last Number Redial (LNR) is a feature that allows you to
&gt;        redial the last number you called by simply hitting the
&gt;        octothorpe key (#) two times.

"Octothorpe," for heaven's sake?

It's not listed in my compact OED [nor in my American Heritage or Webster's
New Collegiate].  "Thorp" is, though.  According to the OED, it means "a
hamlet, village, or small town," and it's archaic, at that.

Of course, "octothorpe" may be a mathematical or technoweenie term I'm just
not familiar with.   Wouldn't be the first time...

                                                        -- Nina

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Ah, the old octothorpe.

A "thorpe", we learn from the bargain-basement (not really a) Webster's
unabridged that DEC has scattered all over the place, is a "beam" (or also
"village", cognate with "dorp" and "dorf", but that's not important now),
so that makes this # an "eight-beamer", which I suppose you get by counting
the bits that stick out around the sides like roofbeams.  So that means
that some Bell System smartie either dredged this term out of the depths of
a misspent classical liberal education or found it socked away in some
hellish Bellish character set and set it loose on the waiting world.

This here octothorpe apparently has a number of names and shapes and is
generally not to be trusted.  PostScript (tm Adobe) calls it a
"numbersign", and ISO Latin-1 nearly concurs, calling it a "Number Sign"
(Row 032, Cell 035). Most Digits seem to call it a "pound sign" and I was
much amused when I noticed that the DEC British keyboard put the British
money hex pound sign, the L with the mark through it, in place of the
tic-tac-toe pound sign, and not in the place of the US money hex dollar
sign, the S with the lines through it, thinking that the almighty dollar
had won again, until I recalled that, of course, the S with the lines
through it is also a powerful RAD50 hex sign, used much for disenchanting
and spell-casting on DEC systems, so it had to be preserved and it was just
somebody's droll idea of a joke to replace one "pound sign" with another.

However, take care, Musician Eppes, not to confuse the "Number Sign" with
the "Musical Sharp" (that's Row 037, Cell 076, in your Multi-octet
Character Set), which is quite a different guy.  The "Number Sign" has two
horizontal lines combined with two *slanted* uprights (much like two
"virgules", if you're still with us) crossed by two *straight* horizontal
lines, while the "Musical Sharp" has two *vertical* uprights and a pair of
*curvy* horizontals that look kind of like tildes on steroids.  (The
"Musical Natural", by the way, is much squarer than either of these other
two.)

So, are both the "Musical Sharp" and the "Number Sign" "octothorpes"?  Or
is it only the "Number Sign"?  And, why is it funny?

PS - Of course, in Japanese kanji, this thing is the character "SEI, or i"
meaning "well", as in the Japanese proverb, "The frog in the well does not
know the ocean."

(Thanks to the scholarship of Mark "Font Doctor" DeVries, Neil "White Belt"
Keefe, and Bill "Blaise Pascal Jr." Kohlbrenner for all the errors in the
above.)

Tom,

        The baby wipe warmer has been a favorite gift for "expectant" friends
of mine for quite some time.  It is indeed perfect for "yuppies," those who
like novelties, and those who already have everything (or so they think).
Actually, what I like best about it is a secondary feature, which was not
mentioned in Desparado.  You see, besides warming the baby wipes, the light
that provides the heat doubles as a nightlight!

I forwarded the item about the baby-wipe-warmer to a bunch of my

  Until parenthood, I would've scoffed and sighed and mumbled something
  about rampant consumerism. I have changed my tune when it comes to
  baby products. Luckily Andrew isn't one of the babies who cries in
  response to chilled wipes, but there are lots that do and if the
  stupid wipe warmer would give me a few more moments of peace, I'd get
  one. I wonder if wipes microwave well? :-)

  Hear the one about the apparatus that hooks onto baby's crib and
  simulates the vibration of a car (in an effort, of course, to induce
  sleep)?  That's got to win an award for "What Will They Think of Next?"

You guys are confused.  "A decade" is a period of 10 years.
"A century" is 100 years, etc. etc.

So you can refer to the decade of the 80s, and it's 80 through 89.

On the other hand, the first decade of the 20th century ran 1901-1910,
and the 9th decade runs 1981 to the end of 1990.  The 'thousands' end
Dec. 31, 1999, the 2nd millenium ends Dec 31, 2000.

Now we rarely refer to the 9th decade (the one we're in) but to the
80s.  We do however, refer to the 20th century and 2nd millenium of
the Christian Era.  These end Dec 31, 2000.

It is even money on what will happen Dec 31, 1999.   Clearly the press
and educated people will get the message out about when the 3rd
millenium begins (2001, that's why Clarke &amp; Kubrick named their movie that
way.)

But people will not be able to resist the urge to party on Jan 1, 2000,
so they will.  And they will party again Jan 1, 2001.  Any excuse for a party.

Subj:   Let's clear up this decade/century/millennium crap once and for all!

    Look, it's time we desperatum (aww, you go figure out the damn plural
    form, Tom, you started it) take matters in our own hands.  All this
    confusion over whether 1990 is in the seventh or eight decade of the
    century, and whether 2000 is in the twentieth or twentieth-first
    century, all got started with the presumption that the current
    calendar started with year number 1 or number 0.

    (Aside:  I saw somewhere someone using the nomenclature "1989 `CA'",
    for something like `Current Age' or 'Current Era'.  Give me a break!).

    Well, how do we know that the Gregorian calendar *didn't* start with
    the year 0?  Maybe it did!  And what difference would it make if it
    didn't?!  So let's arbitrarily and unilaterally declare that the first
    year anno Domini is the year 0!  Thusly, we can now and forever more
    be free of pompus boors who think they know better.  *WE* will all be
    correct in asserting that, according to the Parmenterian calendar,
    2000 is the first year of the new century, that 1990 is the first year
    of the ninth (er, tenth) decade, that 00:00 is the first minute of the
    day, that Jan 1 is the first day of the month, um, ahh, ....

    On second thought, maybe you should forget I brought it up.

     The real problem, as several have mentioned before is that we are
     confusing two different ways of counting when we say that it is 1989.
     The original usage would be that this is the one thousand nine hundred
     eighty-ninth year Anno Domini (sp?) not that 1,989 years have elapsed
     since we started counting.  When we say it is 1:17 we mean that 17
     minutes have elapsed since the beginning of the hour.  Similarly
     almost all of our modern measuring systems start at 0.  A stick is a
     meter and a half long, we do not refer to the end being at the end of
     end of the 50th centimeter in the second meter. Time keeping seems to
     be one of the few areas where this is not the convention thus the
     confusion.  If you are not using 24 hour time the way we represent
     hours is *very* strange: AM or PM indicates which half of the day you
     are currently in, not what has been completed.  Also 2 minutes after
     noon is conventionally considered to be PM, meaning that the first
     hour of PM is not labeled 0 or 1, but 12!!!  Then the rest of the
     hours refer to how many hours have passed since it changed from AM to
     PM.  Not to mention the continuing contriversy of which of noon and
     midnight is 12 AM and which 12 PM. Twenty four hour notation solves
     these problems and puts hours on the same 0 starting system as
     minutes, seconds, and practically every other measuring system.
     Moving on to larger time units:  We start our months with the 1st day
     of the month and we refer to it as such on occation but for the most
     part we ignore that when writing dates.  Its Jan 1, not the first day
     of January. Once again we are opening the doors to confuse the two
     systems.  Similarly when we number dates the 1st month is January the
     2nd Febuary, etc.  But yet once again we just write 1, 2, 3 ...  This
     along with the fact that we also number years this way means we get
     dates like 1989-12-20 (or 12-20-1989 or 20-12-1989 for those who
     prefer those orders)  These type of numerically written dates lead us
     to the false conclution that we can read and interpret dates the same
     way we can read and interpret times on our digital watches.  That is
     3:32 means 3 hours and 32 minutes have passed since the begining of
     the day (assumming AM or 24 hour) so 12-20-1989 must mean that 1989
     years 12 months and 20 days have passed since whenever the counting
     was started.  Most of us (hopefully) have enough everyday experiance
     with the passing of days and months to know that if the date is
     1-1-1990, one day and one month have not already passed, but the case
     becomes ambiguous when we refer to the year.  This type of confusion
     is entirely due to the conflict of the two systems of measuring
     things.  The first is the older one, dealing with discreete units of
     time that are seperated and counted as one would count apples.  Years,
     months, and days are counted as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. instead of
     measured (xxxx years have elapsed) because that is how we incounter
     them in daily life.  We treat each day as a seperate identity,
     independant of the days around it.  We want a way to identify IT as an
     entity as seperate from those around it.  Very few of us care how many
     days have elapsed since the begining of the month, we only need to
     know what day our appointment with Mr. Jones is.  Hours and smaller
     units of time are not encountered as discreetely as days and longer
     units are.  Since these time periods are so short they seem to slide
     right into each other.  There is nothing like a period of sleep to
     psycologically seperate hours from each other.  Because of this all
     these smaller units are psycologically ameniable (sp?) to being
     treated in the same way as we measure things...amount elapsed since
     the start. So we have two seperate systems for indicating time.  Each
     adapted to its use.  The new century and millenium do begin at the
     midnight between Dec. 31, 2000 and Jan 1, 2001, but as many people
     have pointed out it won't matter one bit.  The distinction between the
     two systems has been blurred since before we started abbriveiating
     "the one thousand nine hundred eighty- ninth year of our lord as 1989
     AD.  (This also leads to the mistaken assumption that AD and BC are
     like positive and negitive with a zero in between.)  The significant
     event to the masses is that good 'ol 2 rolling over.  The actual
     passing of the millenia is something that those of us who care can
     remember, or perhaps a comment during the the New Year's Celebration
     Telecasts from times square in either 2000 or 2001, but is really not
     something which will have too much significance.  The year is simply
     not psycologically identified with a measure of how many years,
     decades, or whatever have passed  ... it is simply a label to identify
     when you are talking about.  And on Jan 1, 2000 *EVERYONE* (and I
     think I can say that truthfully) will have to do something they have
     never done before.  Not put 19 at the beginning of years on forms,
     letters, etc.  That is the event which will be celebrated. It is
     important to *KNOW* though that those agonizing that the millenia
     starts at 2001 and not 2000 are RIGHT.  The statement that the year
     2000 will be in the 21st century because the 1st century only had 999
     years is simply wrong.  No one forgot a year or anything of that sort.
     There is simply a discrepency between how we write years and dates
     (1989) and the origin of that number (the one thousand .....th year
     AD.) and how different people interpret dates.  Many of us
     math/science people tend to like everything to be like a measurement,
     a system we are very familiar with. Too bad.  The way society writes
     the date is simply not that way. I, being the revisionist that I am,
     write the time and date like yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm, subtracting 1 from
     year, month, and day to make those more like measurements.  Of course
     very few people understand what I mean when I say it is
     1988:11:19:04:14 SFT.  I only regret it is too inconvienient to put
     everything in base 10 using only seconds.  Imagine talking about 86.4
     ks (kilo-seconds) instead of a day!!  We could base our "daily"
     routine on a 100 ks cycle and get that 27 hour day we all need to get
     things done!! Oh well, I guess if I cand get anyone to celebrate on
     Jan 1 2001 I'll never succeed in getting people to measure time in
     seconds past some standard. Darn!!!  I guess I'll stick with SFT for
     myself.  Bye.

Over the weekend I was thinking as the radio stations were all doing
their "End of the Decade" specials about when a decade (or century or
year) ends.  While it is true that the ninth decade of the 20th century
ends December 31, 1990, the 1990's started on January 1, 1990.  So the
"90's" are not exactly the same years as the decades of the calendar.

Which brings up the point that a decade is simply a span of 10 years.
A decade can start in 1990, 1991 or 1995 for that matter.  My personal
decade started on January 26, 1987 since I was born in 1957.  So if all
the masses of people who don't know any better want to start the decade
on January 1, 1990, they are perfectly within their rights to do so.

Of course the best solution is to get the few "knowledgable" people to
agree to add a year 0 (zero) into the calendar.  This would end the
arguments over when a decade or century really begins.  The dates that
would be affected are all B.C. (who was actually born in 4 BC so it
doesn't affect his birthday) and most of those dates are "circa" which
I take to mean "we're not quite sure".  The only people that it would
affect are a few historians and anthropologists.  This would then save
the masses of ignorant people from feeling stupid when some historian
goes on Johnny Carson and explains that the 21st century doesn't really
start until 2001.

to pick up a take out order.   I spoke briefly to the waitress behind the
counter, who told me my order would be done in a few minutes.

So, while I was busy gazing at the farm implements hanging on the walls, I was
approached by two, uh, um... well, let's call them "natives".  These guys
might just be the *original* Texas rednecks -- complete with ten-gallon hats,
snakeskin boots and the pervasive odor of cheap beer and whiskey.

"Pardon us, ma'am.  Mind of we ask you a question?"

Well, people keep telling me that Texans are real friendly, so I
nodded.

"Are you a Satanist?"

Well, at least they didn't ask me if I liked to party.

"Uh, no, I can't say that I am."

"Gee ma'am.  Are you *sure* about that?" they asked.

I put on my biggest, brightest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader smile and said, "No,
I'm positive.  The closest I've ever come to Satanism is watching Geraldo."

"Hmm.  Interesting. See, we was just wondering why it is you have the lord of
darkness on your chest there."

I was *this close* to slapping one of them and causing a scene -- then I
stopped and noticed the T-shirt I happened to be wearing that day.  Sure
enough, it had a picture of a small, devilish looking creature that has for
quite some time now been associated with a certain operating system.  In this
particular representation, the creature was wearing sneakers.

They continued: "See, ma'am, we don't exactly *appreciate* it when people show
off pictures of the devil. Especially when he's lookin' so friendly."

These idiots sounded terrifyingly serious.

Me: "Oh, well, see, this isn't really the devil, it's just, well, it's sort of
a
mascot."

Native: "And what kind of football team has the devil as a mascot?"

Me: "Oh, it's not a team.  It's an operating-- uh, a kind of computer."

I figured that an ATM machine was about as much technology as these guys could
handle, and I knew that if I so much as uttered the word "unix" I would only
make things worse.

Native: "Where does this satanical computer come from?"

Me: "California.  And there's nothing satanical about it really."

Somewhere along the line here, the waitress has noticed my predicament -- but
these guys probably outweighed her by 600 pounds, so all she did was look at
me sympathetically and run off into the kitchen.

Native: "Ma'am, I think you're lying.  And we'd appreciate it if you'd leave
the premises now."

Fortunately, the waitress returned that very instant with my order, and they
agreed that it would be okay for me to actually pay for my food before I left.
While I was at the cash register, they amused themselves by talking to each
other.

Native #1: "Do you think the police know about these devil computers?"

Native #2: "If they come from California, then the FBI oughta know about
'em."

They escorted me to the door.  I tried one last time: "You're really blowing
this all out of proportion.  A lot of people use this "kind of computers".
Universities, researchers, businesses.  They're actually very useful."

Big, big, BIG mistake.  I should have guessed at what came next.

Native: "Does the government use these devil computers?"

Me: "Yes."

Another BIG boo-boo.

Native: "And  does the government *pay* for 'em? With *our* tax dollars?"

I decided that it was time to jump ship.

Me: "No.  Nope.  Not at all.  You're tax dollars never entered the picture at
all.  I promise.  No sir, not a penny. Our good Christian congressmen would
never let something like that happen.  Nope.  Never. Bye."

Texas.  What a country.

This, of course, completely ignores the possiblity that Unix *is* a Satanic
plot.  It is characteristic of the SubGeniuses (dig that plural!) that they
prefer not discussing Satanic plots.  Hmm.

The article on the humongous power cable in issue 2023 was both
interesting and entertaining - I guess that shows what sort of brain
damage I have.  I had not seen the story before, so thanks for
publishing it.

I had an interesting conversation with my dentist this morning, while
waiting for the novocaine to kick in, on the topic of material science
with regard to the stuff they use to fill cavities.  The amalgam of
silver and mercury has not changed substantially since the late 1800s,
but small improvements continue to be made.  The grinding process for
making silver powder has improved so that less mercury is needed,
which means slightly less hazard for the dentist (the mercury hazard
to the wearer of the material is somewhat less than the hazard from
eating fish), and the material works better and is stronger.  Some
modern plastic materials have been tried, but are not a substantial
improvement other than appearance, and must be used in near-ideal
circumstances to be successful - a totally dry tooth surface is
required, which is just really hard.  Well, add this to your library
of useless knowledge.

-Paul S.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
This knowledge is not entirely useless, as it emphasizes that the danger
from mercury in the mouth is not to the owner of the mouth, but to the
dentist.  Some dentists are making a good thing out of testing for heavy
metals in the mouth and advising replacement of all fillings pronto.  As
for the humungous power cable, read on.

&gt; That's where the LN-2 comes in.  An elegant solution if you ask me. They
&gt; dig holes on both sides (20-30 feet each way) of the fault, wrap the pipe
&gt; with giant (asbestos-looking) blankets filled with all kind of tubes and
&gt; wires, feed LN-2 through the tubes, and *freeze* the oil. Viola!
&gt; Programmable plugs!  The faulty section is drained, sliced, the bad stuff
&gt; removed, replaced, welded back together, topped off, and the plugs are
&gt; thawed.  I was amazed.

    Elegant, indeed.  The inspiration for this trick must have come from
    someone who knows how real Champagne ("fremented in THIS bottle") is
    produced.  I can't recite all the details, but at some point in the
    fermenting and ageing process, they have to fortify the wine with
    additional sugar to encourage the yeasts to produce more alcohol and
    carbon dioxide for the bubbly.  This is done by freezing the neck (I
    suppose with a salt/ice slurry back in the old days), removing the
    cork, putting the sugar solution in the space left at the top, then
    recorking (with a *new* cork, of course).  Of course, scaling up at
    this level is something else...

Subj:   The Power Cable Story

For those of you who were interested in the first piece of mail I
forwarded from Tom McMahon about the huge power cable: I asked him for
an update, and he sent this.  I think we might have missed one episode
of the story, in which we learn that the liquid nitrogen business is
all for naught because they decided that they have to drain the oil from
the entire cable, because each and every joint has to be upgraded to avoid
a repeat of the present incident.

Date: Thu, 21 Dec 89 09:43 PST
From: Thomas L. Mc Mahon &lt;tlm@WHITE.SWW.Symbolics.COM&gt;

Below is a report on the status as of a couple weeks ago.  Nothing much has
happened since.  I've got so many people around the country now asking me for
updates I am going to have to build a formal distribution list so I can keep
track and not forget anyone.

---

OK, ok, you've all been bugging me for an update.  First a refresher:

Oct 20, 1989

.....

At each of the splices they are going to install special aluminum
(non-magnetic) collars around the conductors to keep the splices from
getting pulled into the necked-down section of the pipe.  These collars
are being specially fabricated now and will be ready in about a month.

At each splice they have to build a semi clean room to keep dirt,
moisture, worker sweat, and any other contaminants out of the joint
before closing.  After all, we're talking a quarter megavolt!  They have
special air conditioning and filter units for the vaults.  Each joint
will take two months of work.  They will get some degree of parallelism
in the phase of the project.

After repairing and replacing the faulted section of cable, stabilizing
all of the splices, and buttoning it all up comes the job of putting the
oil back in.  First the pipe is evacuated and then back-filled with
nitrogen etc as I described earlier.  After extensive filtering, the oil
is heated to about 230 degrees Farenheit.  It gets injected into a
vacuum chamber at that temperature through hundreds of spray nozzles.
This gets the maximum possible surface area so all the crap in it boils
out into the chamber.  The good stuff that's left is collected and
pumped immediately into one end of the pipeline.

Then they power it up and see if it works.  If not, they start over
again.  I'll keep you posted.

----

12/11/89

The pipeline is now completely drained and filled with nitrogen at
atmospheric pressure.  They are still in the process of opening up many
of the splices to install the collars.  They originally planned on doing
14 of them but now the number is 17.

The splice where the short happened, and the cable for about 40 feet to
either side of it, has been completely replaced.  Engineering prototypes
of the aluminum collars are now installed there and the whole thing is
all welded back together.  They built new vaults under the street where
the new splices are.  The trucks, men, and their equipment are all gone
and the roadbed has been repaved.  They consider the segment where the
short happened "fixed".  We'll see...

Now that they verified the assembly of a splice with the new collars in
it (to make sure they had the details right) they are going ahead with
the fab run for the 17 other joints.  They won't be done installing them
until mid April.  Then they'll put the oil in as described above and
power it up slowly.  I don't expect to have much to report until then
and I promise to send an update.

Assuming 8 month down time the cost of the electricity alone will
approach $75 million!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Interestingly, that archaic wooden electrical junction box in front of my
house that I mentioned after the last installment of this opus had to be
dug up and replaced again last night.  As the Bonzo Dog (Doo Dah) Band
says, It's tragic magic.  There are no coincidences, but sometimes the
pattern is more obvious.

The story, as I vaguely recall, went something like this:  The guy who worked
on the "OS/magtape manager" originally worked at a defense contractor.  One
project there was developing software for a computer to be used on submarines.
After spending N months (years?) on this project, it was delayed (or perhaps
even canceled) because the computer wouldn't fit through the submarine's
25" hatch.  Needless to say, he found this ironically amusing and has installed
the error message 'unit will not fit thru 25" hatch' in every project he's
worked on since.

I got the story from Rob Stanzel, and I think he got it first or second hand
from the original source.

Cheers,
jp

                                                       We could don't now see
    how to do it, it isn't at all clear, but we are just a hairsbreadth away
    from ridding ourselves of policies, actions, and attitudes that are as
    harmful to us (in smaller ways) as the stupid, evil (same thing) policies
    of the communist dictatorships.  We are just a hairsbreadth away from good
    schools that teach, a way of treating illness, a way of being poor or rich
    that's not so destructive, a way of fighting crime without imperiling
    freedom, a way of . . .

I must register two major disagreements with this passage.

First, it seems to me that, in a way, it's easier to make a big change
than a small change.  The changes that have happened in eastern Europe
took place because a *large* fraction of the populace was *very*
angry, and because they all suddenly gained the will and courage to
join together and take action.  I don't think the same mechanism can
be applied to problems that are relatively smaller, in a population so
many of whom are fundamentally *not* angry and dissatisfied.  As far
as I can tell from reading history, the real force and drive behind
many revolutions is that many people were starving: suffering
deprivation hour to hour, and considering it to be unjust deprivation
rather than the normal course of life.  I don't think the mechanism or
forces of nation-wide revolution can be used to solve specific social
problems such as the ones you mention.

Second, there's a big difference between choosing between options, and
creating new options.  Everyone knows what is means to "force the
rascals out"; the big issue was deciding to do so.  Not everybody
knows how to deal with crime without infringing on liberties, a very
tough problem.

Not that I'm trying to be a killjoy; the news from eastern Europe has
been happier than I ever thought I'd hear in my life.  The day
Ceacescu was overthrown, it was hard to think about anything else, and
many of us just stopped working and gathered around the radio at 5:00
to listen to All Things Considered and cheer.  Did you hear Andre
Codrescu's piece that night?  The joy in his voice was almost
unbearable.  Dave Andre and Bob Cassels had a party that night;
previously scheduled as a Christmas party, but they served Rumanian
white wine.

Daniel Schorr pointed out that events seemed to disprove theories that
had reigned until recently that (1) the people in Rumania were too
weak, disheartened, and poor to put up any kind of meaningful
resistance, and (2) that the Ceacescu governement, by virtue of its
control over TV, could keep the people from learning about what had
been happening in the neighbooring countries.  The capacity for people
to overthrow dictatorships is very impressive.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Probably right, Dan, but some of these things, notably the school system,
are enormously resemblant to a dictatorship and might be overthrown by the
same means.  Whereas in the 19th century, the average man (as they quaintly
put it back then) is only nine meals away from a revolution.  In the 21st
century, which has already begun, all date-madness to the contrary, perhaps
the average person is only nine *ideas* away from a revolution.

Furthermore, if these good changes are only a hairsbreadth away, bad
changes are also only a hairsbreadth away, and impositions on our liberty,
instead of being the thin edge of the wedge as we have always thought, may
just be the key turning in the lock.

So, resist evil and promote good and have some fun along the way.

My heart leaps with joy as I tell you that the people responsible for
"Roger Ramjet" have been producing an all-new series of cartoons for
PBS's "Square One" (shown on Ch. 2 at 5:00 PM weekdays in the Boston
area).

The main character is Dirk Niblick, world's greatest mathemetician, with
voice supplied once again by Gary Owens.  Yank, Doodle, Dan, and Dee
have been replaced by Fluff and Fold, two equally idealistic kids.  The
mood, gags, dialogue, and plot are as you remember them.

I am told (by the same unreliable source who neglected to tell me about
the existence of Dirk Niblick months ago) that the cartoons do not
appear in every episode of Square One.  So tape the show and take your
chances; even if you miss Dirk Niblick, you'll catch Mathnet ("The
problems are real.  Only the names have been changed.") and some other
pretty funny takeoffs on old TV shows.  Like the rest of public TV for
kids, this is better than anything else on the toob for "adults".

And, you can see reruns of Roger Ramjet and His American Eagle Squadron on

I woke up suddenly at 1:30 AM with an explanation for "cactodes".  It's a
bit involved, so you may want to sit down.  Say our Greek-less reader has
taken up the famous "Festus on Fables", a great professor's explication of
Greek myths.  Say Festus is a bit pompous and likes to throw in bits of
Greek at random.  He starts with a myth ["muthos"], one like how if you
dedicate cinnnamon to the sun and turn your back, it will spontaneously
burst into flame.  But being a professor he has to equivocate no matter
what, so he mentions by the way that Theophrastus called such stories
"myths" ["ta muthodes"].  "Ah ha!" shouts our reader, "now Catherine is
sure to love me -- I mean how many people are aware that muthodes is the
plural of muths". Now Festus, being a professor, assumed all his readers
were fluent in nineteen unrelated languages, and knew that in Greek, an
adjective in the neuter plural could be used as a noun, and that "muthodes"
was an adjective built from "muthos" and "eidos" meaning "myth-like", so
"ta muthodes" meant something like "them myth-like things".  Months later,
our reader discovers that Latin and Greek shared the word "cactus" (or
"kaktos" -- omicron not omega, as stated in desperado), and now he forms
the plural "cactodes" in all innocence.  Actually, the plural is "kaktoi",
since "kaktos" is a normal second delension feminine noun, and no other
case remotely resembles "cactodes".

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Yeah, that's the ticket.

Another fun thing to do with plurals:  "mores and folkways". If you had one
of each, it would be "mos and folkway".

And, in closing, I ought to explain a little about how I compose these
things.  I append all appropriate mail to a file until it begins to look
full and then I start editing it.  In the meantime, all new appropriate
mail goes into the next consecutively numbered file.  That means all the
stuff you've sent me in the past couple of weeks is in the next one, not
this one.  It seems to help to let things sit for awhile anyway.  I take
off lots of the dates, so things won't seem stale, pick and choose among
what I stil want to mail after sitting awhile, and then off it goes, almost
always on a Friday afternoon.  There's already 1029 lines in #2026, and
even allowing 15 percent for mail headers, there's the raw material of
another nice issue right there.

At Symbolics, non-Symbolics readers will be interested to learn, we had a
font called "tiny" which was two-by-four pixels (or some such) and we
printed all the mail headers in that font.  Took much less time to paint
the screen and you didn't have to read them, and yet, if you were dying to
read nine "Recieveds" in a row, all you had to do was change the font, and
there you were, bored to death like everyone else.

Best, your buddy,
