        The paradox of Gilbert Gottfried:

                A little bit of Gilbert Gottfried goes a long way, but a
                lot of Gilbert Gottfried doesn't go very far.

        My major point of sympathy with Ross Perot is his irritation with
        the press for lumbering him with the name "H. Ross Perot" which he
        has never used in his entire life.

        The US Army simply will not accept it if you have no middle
        initial.  Even if your legal name is Joe Turandot, the Army can't
        stand it.  They cope with the crisis of no middle initial by
        giving you *three* of the damned things, to wit, Joe Turandot
        becomes Joe NMI Turandot.

        Apparently the press has spent so much time getting names of
        crooks from the desk sergeant that they now insist on
        birth-certificate names from everybody.  If H. Ross Perot thinks
        he can get away with calling himself Ross Perot, he's got another
        think coming.

        My middle name is Thomas.  My first name is William. My dad's name
        was William so I go by Tom.  You would not believe the hours of my
        life that have been devoted to unraveling this very confusing
        practice. One of the many reasons that I will not run for office
        is that I refuse to be transformed into W. Thomas Parmenter.

        I covered a crime syndicate trial once where one of the witnesses
        had signed his name on checks as S. George Metropolis.  For the
        entire trial the defense attorneys were saying stuff like, "Now,
        was your brother S. George present at that time?"  "And what did
        S. George say then?"

        I used to pass a billboard advertising the services of one G.
        Fetter Puthuf.

                                    =*=

        I suppose we're all agreed that Perot has played out his string?

Subj:   Ross Perot's email address in Desperado 3065

Uh oh, I think you didn't get the follow-up posting saying Ross Perot's email
address given was wrong.  It belongs to some guy who used to work for Ross
Perot, but no longer does, and now he's getting swamped with all this mail,
which CompuServe makes him pay for.  At least that's what it said in email.

I have my own theory about that: Nobody resigns from Ross Perot's employ and
gets away scot-free.

Subj:   Suggested slogan for Perot

It strikes me that this could be a lot of fun given the fact that
Perot made his billions by ripping off government programs. If he
really wants to make these issues stand out, his slogan should be:

        Perot for President: It takes a thief to catch one.

Subj:   Ordinary Folks Can Fax Perot!

=o= The creator of _Doonesbury_ is back on sabbatical, and
apparently he's using it to write OpEd pieces for the _New_
_York_Times_.  This is just like one of his interactive
strips, though.  Check it out!
    &lt;_Jym_&gt;
================================================================

        Just the Fax
        by Garry Trudeau

A few years back, ex-Congressional aide Christopher Matthews set
forth a political stratagem he called "hanging a lantern on your
problem," by which he meant pre-emptively establishing the terms
under which you would be judged.

This is what is happening in Dallas, where can-do un-candidate
Ross Perot has been overseeing the lighting of his towering
ignorance.  Recently emerging from five minutes of seclusion and
study, Perot has now declared that the traditional means of
measuring intentions -- thoughtful positions -- are the sullied
trappings of a discredited profession.  Hereafter, Perot informs
us, only his principles will be made available for public
inspection.

Whew.  Talk about calling off your own final exams.
Self-relieved of the need to know anything, Perot can now
concentrate on the myth-maintenance that is his first love.
This he does primarily by reviewing the neat stack of faxed
press queries that are placed on his desk every day.  Perot
doesn't want to deal with any more trick questions like "how
would reduce the deficit?", so reporters are now required to
transmit their inquiries by fax, with a turn-around time of
about 72 hours.

This cumbersome procedure is infuriating to those of us who
prefer dairy-fresh information about the Perot principles -- and
don't want to wait three long news cycles to get it.  So why not
cut out the middlemen of the press altogether, and access the
Populist Uplinker directly?  The fax form [below] has been
provided for just such purposes: for those still unfamiliar with
the above-referenced principles, a set of starter questions has
been provided.

Message:

Dear Mr. Perot:

  I am an Ordinary Person interested in learning more about your
principles.  I am not interested in your positions, because
Ordinary People don't give a spit about positions until they've
been checked out by world-class experts and presented on
interactive TV.  I have checked below the principles I am most
interested in.  I understand that I will receive a refreshingly
candid and colorful response within three business days.

__ What principle was represented by your three different
explanations of why you tried to avoid completion of your Navy
tour of duty?  Was there a different principle behind each
explanation, or does one principle cover all three?

__ Which of your principles inspired the House Ways and Means
Committee to strike a late-night secret deal giving you a
special $15 million tax break?  What was the relationship of
that principle to concurrent campaign contributions?

__ When you lost a Texas Medicaid contract in 1980, which
principle inspired you to dig up enough dirt on the winning firm
to have its bid overturned?

__ Your reported suggestion that minority neighborhoods be
cordoned off for house-to-house drug and gun searches is
representative of which principle?

__ Your lawyer's efforts to subvert the workings of a Texas
legislative committee to win approval of a huge bond issue
beneficial to your family's holdings is evidence of what
principle?

__ Your claim to have compromising photos of a newspaper
employee was prompted by what principle?

__ Your claim to have compromising photos of a Pentagon official
was prompted by what principle?

__ Which principle motivated your recent threat to make
embarrassing disclosures about the Nixon and Republican
Administrations if G.O.P. officials continued making
unflattering revelations about you?

__ Yes, I'm interested in receiving additional information
about your principles.  I have you assurance that no salesman
will call.

Subj:   thesis

In his masters' thesis, "Adaptive Voxel Subdivision for Ray Tracing",
University of Calgary, November 1990, David Jevans starts his
"Acknowledgements" with:

        As a young, overfunded graduate student, I would often pass idle
        hours drinking medicinal alcoholic concoctions, and firing shotgun
        blasts at pieces of paper nailed to the side of the university's
        orgone accumulator outhouse.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered
        that the performance graphs of my ray tracing algorithms exactly
        matched the patterns blasted into those pellet ridden sheafs!
        Seeing this as a sign of divine acceptance, of some kind of grand
        conjunction of information, I collected my results into the volume
        of forbidden knowledge that you hold before you.

Re: Desperado #3063, SRL project...

&gt;SRL is also beginning construction of what will be the largest walking
&gt;machine, dwarfing the Ambler at 40 tons and about the linear
&gt;dimensions of a school bus.

This might be the largest that SRL was created, but it infinitely smaller
than the largest walking machine ever made.  The credit for that goes to
Bucyrus-Erie, for their walking dragline, "Big Muskie", residing somewhere
in the spoilbanks south of Columbus, Ohio.

The 2nd largest (there are two) is the BE3270W.  The 3270s reside in
Warrick County, Indiana (AMAX's Ayrshire Mine) and near Marion, Illinois
(AMAX's Delta Mine).  The have walking pontoons approx. 80' long, and the
machine rests on a "tub", a flat-bottomed round structure about 80' in
diameter.

I couldn't venture a guess at the tonnage of these babies, but the 3270's
boom (that crane-like structure on the front) measures 330' long.  The
machine house is about 120' x 120' x about 4 stories tall, and the whole
thing rotates completely in less than a minute.  The bucket capacity on
the 3270 is 176 cubic yards, enough to hold a good-sized party in.

Tom,

        So, I get a sub request mentioning your e-rag, and I, never
having heard of any Desperado, asked to see an ish.

&gt; From eirikur@ranger.enet.dec.com Wed Jun 17 15:53:31 1992
&gt;
&gt; This issue mentions CORE.
&gt;
&gt; Subscribe.  Say I sent you. (for no particular reason other than that it
&gt; is social.)
&gt;

&gt; Eirikur
&gt;
&gt;         I got a rival net-wire newsrag called CORE from the Electronic
&gt;         Frontier Foundation and even though I approve of almost everything
&gt;         the effers are  doing, I was surprised at the retro style of this
&gt;         publication, which has *poetry* and *fiction* (based on the
&gt;         author's life) just like a literary magazine.  It's a bit odd to
&gt;         read such old-timey stuff on the net.  Also strange is the
&gt;         disclaimer/offer, "CORE may be reproduced freely *in its entirety
&gt;         only* throughout Cyberspace." That, as we know, is not how we do
&gt;         things here in Cyberspace. Anyway, send stuff and requests to
&gt;         "rita@eff.org" and copy by anonymous ftp from "eff.org".  My copy
&gt;         (thanks Rik Kabel) is dated October 3.  The stuff in it is okay,
&gt;         understand, but it's just so like something with buff, tan, dun or
&gt;         dull green covers that you'd buy in Harvard Square and definitely
&gt;         not as Cyberspacy as we are here in Desperadoland.
&gt;

        And I see this.  Well, first, following is the October issue,
which is nothing like you describe -- I think you saw the September
issue.  And yes, I'm RETRO.  CORE is a knee-jerk reaction I had last
summer in response to all the SF/Fantasy drivel spewed across the Net.
There are only so many bad rip-off's of William Gibson I could endure.
In DESPERATION (you understand) I HAD to do something.  Besides, *I*
do CORE, not EFF, as a breather from all the Cybershit.

        Sub me to Desperado if you dare, bud.

love 'n kisses,
Rita

        So there you have an issue of "CORE *in its entirety only*" and
        I'll have to say this one sure wasn't retro at all.  So, get in
        touch with the beautiful, witty, and wise rita@eff.org (who is
        also a quick hand with the champagne and oysters) or copy CORE by
        anonymous ftp from "eff.org" and have a ball.

Someone wrote into _Parade Magazine_ (Sunday newspaper supplement) yesterday

        'Is Iacoccoa Lee's real last name?  Or is it really an acronym
         for "I am Chairman of Chrysler Corporation of America"?'

Subj:   The Imminent Death of Usenet (was Re: Alert)

        There is no way to be sure this is legit or a clever pastiche, but
        then I'm not sure I should care.

Tom, Tom, Tom.  This is a long-standing t.b tradition.  As an
ex-contributor of some note, I can assure you that the clues
are there, the names are dropped, the structure is whole.  This
is a bogus posting; I'll bet money that the real Dr. Wildmon has
never even heard of Usenet, much less talk.bizarre, and certainly
it is doubtful that he has decided to launch a personal jeremiad
against poor Andrew F. Hampe.

This is particularly well done, of course.  I wonder who did it.
I'll ask mr. x and CJ the next time I'm talking to them.

Most of t.b is boring, trite, and juvenile, or it was eight months
ago when I quit reading news.  At its best, talk.bizarre had a sort
of irregular core of interactive fiction enthusiasts, self-appointed
flame gods, writers of arcane and mind-warping fantasies, and other
people whose goal in net.life was thus to blur the distinctions
between the outside world and the world of the net.  In short, the
Wildmon piece is the very apotheosis of talk.bizarre at its aggregate
best.  It made you wonder whether the skew was in your own head or
in the world at large.

Subj:   A talk.bizarre sample

On further reflection, I enclose the following sample of one
of my talk.bizarre postings for the enjoyment and education
of the readership at large.  In this case, the question had
been asked in one of the automotive hobby newsgroups and, well,
something about the question got me started...

Subject: Re: US V8 engine id numbers

In article &lt;180003@hpbbrd.HP.COM&gt; gary@hpbbrd.HP.COM (Gary Tuosto) writes:
&gt;
&gt;  Is it true that the id is stamped somewhere on the block? I have
&gt;  yet to find anything on my 350. Where is it? How does it break
&gt;  down?

The id of most American V8s is an integral part of  the casting, applied
while the metal is still in a  molten state.  The superego is rarely used
these days as a cost-cutting measure; it used to be applied as a hot-vapor
coating just after the casting molds had been removed from the block
(though Hudson had experimented with brushing the superego directly into
the casting cores and pouring molten iron into the hollows; this was one
of the keys to their  "twin-H-power" engines having such reliability,
because the innate sense of moral obligation provided by the superego kept
them working beyond the realm of most contemporary psychoplants).

The roller-lifter ids in use on modern Chevy V8s are not compatible with
the solid-lifter ids in use  during the Fifties and early Sixties.  Later
Tonawanda blocks (recognizable by a difficulty in approaching ethical
questions without some form of affective neurosis) can use the modern
roller-lifter id due to an effective ego structure in the rocker valley
that enables strong decision-making, effective value judgments and good
low-end torque.

It breaks down first by suffering valve seal deterioration, usually in the
#1 cylinder.  After several thousand miles of this, it's not uncommon for
the Chevy 350 to experience minor personality dissociation, followed by
occasional impotence, anticipatory disaffiliation, and a loss of short-
term memory.  In extreme cases, where the motor has been abused while
young, it can suffer from unresolved Oedipal conflicts resulting in a
tendency for the pistons to gall the cylinder bores.  There has been only
limited success with standard treatment (such as cylinder honing,
dry-sleeving and transactional analysis) but new hope appears to be
offered from a combination of role-playing in a group format and PTFE
treatment of the reciprocating surfaces.
