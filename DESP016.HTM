Yes, KABL is still churning its way through the muck (music-to-have-your--
teeth-drilled-by) and people are still cutting up KOME stickers (some not
fit to print in this space).

If we're getting on to animals, how 'bout KMEL with their nice two-humped
bumper stickers...or Boulder's public radio station, KGNU.

Just for the record, KOME is probably not oozing out of your radio as KOMA
(Oklahoma City) is oozing into the hospital wards of the southern midwest...

KOME also advertises itself as the KOME spot on your dial.  California
chic, I guess.

Correction on call letters:  WOOF is at the "University of Southern North
Dakota at Hoople" and is, I believe, as much a creation of Professor Peter
Schickele's as P.D.Q. Bach...

Two questions about the radio trivia:

  1. WVUD (Dayton, Ohio) is the radio station for the University of Dayton.
     There are two obvious reasons for the call letters not being "WVUD."
     But the radio station for UMass/Amherst is WMUA.  Anyone know why?

  2. WHY was the rule established about "K" stations and "W" stations?  And
     why those particular letters?  Please excuse my ignorance, but it must
     have happened before my time (1956), no?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I can't think of two reasons against WVUD's call letters.  Isn't it
the Voice of the University of Dayton?  I'd guess the WMUA is just
Mass University in Amherst.  I think the US was assigned K and W call
letters by the International Telecommunications Union and decided to
use them.  Canadaian stations start with C; Mexican with X, as all us
old XERF (Acuna Couhila, Mexico d/b/a Del Rio, Texas) listeners know.

Subject: When I'm Calling Youuu..uuu..uuu

I'm continually amazed at how radio and TV stations manage to come up with
interesting call letters.  Here are some more I know of:

        WVBR - Voice of the Big Red (run by Cornell U. students)
        WHCU - Home of Cornell University (run by the school - we
               called it Whuck-you.  Contrary to the call signs,
               it was WHCU that carried all the CU sports)
        WLOF - Wonderful Land of Fun, Orlando, FL.  (I seem to recall
               lots of W-for-wonderful in call letters)
        WVII - Channel 7, Bangor ME
        WENH - Eastern New Hampshire (NH Public TV)
        WKIS - Kissimmee, FL
        WTOS - Top of Sugarloaf (mountain - Maine)

and finally, the hardest task in the world, and the trucker's favorite:
        WWVA - Wheeling, West Virginia

Add to the list WNAX, in Yankton, South Dakota.   My grade school days
told me it was the first radio station in South Dakota (my home state).
I also seem to remember that it might have been (one of?) the first
west of the Mississippi.  Those in competition for "first west of" would
definitely have to come from the "W" set.

One important point everyone seems to have missed so far concerning the call
letters assigned to commercial radio stations:  The FCC decided a LONG time
ago that all such were to be four letters long.  Existing three-letter call
signs were "grandfathered".  I don't know exactly when this happened, or even
if it happened before, after, or at the same time as the "W is East, K is West"
decision, but you'll notice the large number (relatively) of 3-letter call
signs among the "out of position" stations.

Now that we have THAT over with, here is a riddle:  How are phone area codes
assigned?  Look at the map, and notice the apparently random pattern.  Then
look more closely...  I'll provide the answer in a little while if no one
else finds it.

I came across two interesting pieces of information the other day
from a member of our sales staff, I thought your readers might be
interested in:

- A man walks into a Digital Computer Store in Boston, U.S. and promptly pulls
  $6000.00 (give or take) out of his pocket to buy a DECmate I system.  The
  digital clerk promptly informs him that he cannot purchase the system with
  cash and requests him to go back home and issue a purchase order to establish
  a line of credit.  The man does so but his credit is not approved and he is
  therefore requested (in letter format, of course) to pay cash.

  -- I would have gone to Sears.

- Of other notable computer store happenings, A young Mr. Olsen (Ken's son)
  walks into a DEC Computer Store and tries to purchase a system. As the clerk
  rings it up on the terminal his credit rating is refused by the system
  (a DEC credit system).

  -- But, a happy ending his father came through in the crunch
     and word is that system is being redesigned!

COBOL would try to obtain more virtual memory.  If it failed, it said:
