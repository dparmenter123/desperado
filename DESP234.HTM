        Black Death Vodka has annoyed the easily annoyed by hiring Slash of
        Guns&amp;Roses to push their brand.  The easily annoyed believe this
        will lead teenagers to try vodka, which never would occur to them
        otherwise.  The USofA government, however, has stepped in.  Are they
        getting on the vodka company for appealing to teenagers with their
        name?  Their label with a death's head wearing a top hat?  Their
        ads with Mr. Slash?

        Why no.  The government is attacking Black Death for false
        labelling.  The name Black Death, the government says, implies
        that the bottle contains germs of the plague and the death's head
        implies that it is poison. In fact, the bottle contains only
        vodka, not a single plague germ and no poison whatsoever.

        Don't believe what you read about the tunnels that flooded in
        Chicago being obscure, forgotten, beyond the consciousness of
        modern Chicagoans, etc.  The tunnels are well-known in Chcaago and
        were much used for running cables, wires, and pipes of various
        kinds.  There were frequent proposals for restoring them for use
        as freight tunnels when I lived in Chicago in the 60s and "keeping
        the tunnels pumped out" was an ongoing priority, both to prevent
        floods and also to maintain the tunnels for present and future
        uses.  The two worst things I've heard about the flood:

                There were homeless people living in the tunnels who
                drowned.  I heard this only once, and it was being denied
                at the time and I've not heard it again.  At that, I only
                saw it in net traffic, not the regular media.

                The many architectural monuments of the Loop are
                threatened because of poor foundation technology in the
                late 19th century.

        I kept thinking about all the kids at the City News Bureau where I
        used to work dashing about and getting probably forty to fifty
        percent of the news copy that was transmitted all during the
        crisis.

        freedom this year?"

        Isn't it cool that President Bush's alleged girlfriend, who is also
        alleged to have a government job (at considerably higher alleged
        pay) is also allegedly named "Jennifer"?  I guess it would be too
        much to ask that she spell it "Gennifer" in that keen and crazy
        Arkansas way, but that's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.  This business
        about Bush's "Jennifer" is floating just outside the public's range
        of vision, but I've seen it all over the place in the last few
        weeks.

                       -&lt; B.B. KING RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!11 &gt;-

    Hi!  I am an occasional noter here, almost always read only.  But I
    came in this morning *looking* for a B.B. King topic.  I only got three
    hours sleep last night, so I may ramble and I will *certainly* gush,
    but...

    I SAW B.B. KING LAST NIGHT!!!  Not only that, I actually *MET* B.B.
    King last night!!!!  It was incredible---truly a peak experience.

    He and his band are playing here in Houston this week (tue-sat, two
    shows).  The late show last night (Wed) was standing room only.  Our
    drummer (I'm in a band) works at Rockefeller's (the club he plays when
    in town) and got me and my roommate (lead singer/bassist) in on the
    guest list.

    THE SHOW WAS AWESOME!!!  I mean, I have a copy of Vol.1 of Greatest
    hits, and I've seen  him many times on TV, heard him on the radio,
    etc., so of course I knew he was *good*, but he totally blew my mind.
    He was about 10 times better than I ever dreamed.  He played licks that
    moved me, and hit speeds I've never heard him hit before.  I was
    surprised at how good his voice was, too--it sounded great.  The band
    was tight (they still tour 300 days/year), the showmanship was
    excellent, and he had the crowd in his palm all night.  He started with
    "Let the Good Times Roll", did an hour and ten minute show ("Rock Me
    All night", "Nobody Loves Me but My Mama" come to mind), ended with
    "The Thrill is Gone" (NO IT ISN'T!!) and encored with a jam, and then
    "Said What I Said Before Love Came To Town" ended the show.
    WOW!WOW!WOW!  Then the night got even better...

    As someone mentioned in an earlier note, he does "hold court" after
    shows to sign autographs.  We waited over an hour in line to see him.
    I had the pickguard taken off my Strat and took it with me to the show
    for him to autograph.  I was planning to be so cool, you know, rap with
    B.B. King, and even planned to invite him to a jam at our house on
    Saturday night.  But when I got up to him, I almost passed out when I
    realized it was *THE* B.B. KING!  I held out my pickguard, stammered
    out "Could I get you to sign this?"  He beamed at me (what a great
    smile) and said "Sure!".  Then--I couldn't help myself--tears welled up
    in my eyes and I was so choked up I couldn't speak a word.  He signed
    and dated by pickguard, and smiled and handed it back.  I choked out a
    "Thank you."  I stood to the side and just cried.  My roommate, much cooler
    than I, was next, and she got a picture of him and Lucille, which he
    autographed to her.  She told him we were musicians, and he lit up.  He
    asked the name of the band, where we were playing, and said he wanted to
    come see us sometime!! (He has family here, so is often around when not
    touring).  She said to him, "She's in my band, too." and pointed to me.
    I was smiling as big as I could but still had tears running down my face.
    He looked at me and laughed and said, "Look at you!  You're so emotional!!
    You sweet thing!"  *THEN* he said, "Come over here!" and held his arms
    out to me...YES!!  B.B. KING HUGGED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Then he said,"You must be one of the most beautiful people on the
    planet.  The world needs more people like you."   I am shaken just
    trying to write this in!  I could have died right at that moment, and
    been completely happy.  It was total bliss.  He was so very nice that I
    didn't even feel too embarassed to be so totally uncool.

    WOW, oh WOW!  Unbelievable.  A gentleman, a warm and generous person, a
    totally classy human being, and a *LEGEND* of a guitar player.  What
    soul he emits on stage!  What a beautiful soul he has inside.  We went
    home and listened to his "Best of" album.  I couldn't sleep last night from
    smiling! and I had to be up for work this morning by 5:30.

    I will *NEVER* forget it as long as I live.  He made one *completely*
    dedicated fan last night, even if I was unable to speak to him.

    *IF* he ever did walk in to a club where we were playing, I would drop
    my guitar and run off the stage.  I am not worthy to play in front of
    him.  I wear the guitar, and hit chords/pick notes, but after what I heard
    last night, I do NOT play the guitar--he and Lucille, *that's* playing the
    guitar...sigh!

    Sorry to ramble on, but I warned you...and I'm WAY too excited to keep
    this to myself.  Thought other King fans would appreciate hearing what
    a super cool guy he is one on one.

    Still High From Last Night,

    Anita

Subj:   A humanist's view of computer manuals

Primo Levi, a chemist from Turin, became known for his humanistic memoirs of
Auschwitz (1947) and more recently for his collections of lucid essays, The
Periodic Table, The Monkey's  Wrench, and Other People's Trades.  When he was
working on the latter, I met Primo Levi at a reception for him at Boston
University.

At that time he explained that he was getting used to his word-processor, but
that it had not mastered him.  I now see that wry commentary reflected in his
essay, "The Scribe"  [Published in Other People's  Trades]

"...My ideas as to what takes place behind the screen are vague.  At first
contact, this ignorance of mine humiliated me profoundly;  a young man rushed
in to reassure me and he had guided me; and to start with  he said to me: You
belong to the austere generation of humanists  who  still insist on wanting
to understand the world around them.  This demand has  become absurd.  Leave
everything to habit and your discomfort will disappear. Consider do you think
you know how the telephone and television work. and  yet  you use them
everday.  And with the exception of a few learned men how many  know how
their hearts and kidneys work?

     "Despite this admonition, the first collision with the apparatus was
filed with anguish, the anguish of the unknown, which for many years I had no
longer felt.  The computer was delivered to me accompanied by a profusion of
manuals.  I tried to study them before touching the keys, and I felt lost.  It
seemed to me that although they were apparently written in Italian, there were
in an unknown language; indeed in a mocking  and misleading language in which
well-known words like "open," "close," and "quit" are used in unusual
ways...."

    Levi goes on to suggest "How much better it would have been to invent a
decisively new terminology for these new things."  But even as he gives
this subtle commentary, he makes a comment to those aspiring to write:

     "Take note that one can attain the maximum of infoormation by various
paths, some quite subtle;  one, fundamental, is the choice of synonyms,
which almost never are equivalent to each other.  There is always one which is
"more right" that the others; but often it is necessary to look for it...

    "In this research, it seems to me important to keep alive the awareness of
the original meaning of each word;  if , for example, you remember that "to
unleash" meant to free from leashes (bonds), you will be able to use the term
in a more apporpriate manner and in less threadbare senses.  Not all readers
will notice the artifice, but they will at least preceive that the choce
wasn't obvious, that you have worked for them, that you have not followed the
line of least resistance." ("To a Young Reader").

     Levi complained about the glossaries in computer manuals that proceed
"in an opposite direction to that of common dictionaries;  these [glossaries]
define fimailiar terms by having recourse to abstruse termers, and the effect
is devasting." ["The Scribe"]

     Levi own writing, praised by the likes of Saul Bellow, is the best
example of this ability to home in on the words that mean the most, and to
define the words of "other people's trades" so that all can understand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
After the just-finished AAAI Symposium on Advanced Buzzwording,
Ian organized an outing yesterday to Survival Research Laboratories.
These are the guys you've probably heard about who build enormous
robots that spit fire, blow up buildings, and rip each other to
pieces.  It's art, you see.

If you have never seen the movie Buckaroo Banzai, you should.  If you
have, you'll know what I mean when I say that SRL is just like the
interior of Yoyodyne research, only more so.  It's an apocalyptic
nightmare of a research lab: endless heaps of twisted rusted steel
concealing mechanical dinosaurs leaking hydraulic fluid; vast
repositories of alien machinery lurking in gloom.

SRL's most recent creation is a half-ton running robot that they
expect when completed to be by far the fastest legged vehicle ever
built.  (Projected top speed 25mph; currently it does 8mph.)  Mark
Pauline, the founder of SRL, demo'd it to us.  It's a six-legged
design with the legs paired in an odd way so that it's really a
tripod.  Motion comes from alternately bringing the two legs in each
pair forward while off the ground.  It's extraordinarily nimble,
walking quite delicately and precisely despite having the size of a
small car.  Control is via a system of Phoenix hydraulic servos.

SRL is also beginning construction of what will be the largest walking
machine, dwarfing the Ambler at 40 tons and about the linear
dimensions of a school bus.

Most of the SRL machines are teleoperated, the most recent one, a
hydraulic gun firing explosive projectiles at 500 ft/sec, via a
head-mounted VR link.  Another current project is a flock of dozens of
autonomous computer-controlled robots each about the size of a coffee
table.  The first five of these have been built.  They communicate via
ultrasonics.  Their goal in life is to lash each other with whips.

Assorted extracts from recent SRL propaganda to give you an idea where
they are coming from:

``One completed device is based on electromagnetic rail gun
technology.  Rather than firing a projectile at high speeds for
kinetic impact effects or other droll, military objectives, this
device employs similar capacitor energy storage units [they showed us
banks of literally tons of capacitors, donated by Lawrence Livermore]
to liquefy a metal bar and magnetically eject the molten blob at about
200 mph.  It appears to the eye as a comet-like beam that fragments on
impact, setting fire to any nearby combustibles.  This machine, with
its long-distance, arson-like capabilities, is SRL's answer to George
Bush's call for a thousand points of light.''

``The Big Arm has risen from the ashes of the 18 piano fire it was
toppled into at the ILLUSIONS OF SHAMELESS ABUNDANCE show May 1989.
In order to retain the sympathy and pathos generated by its fiery
public demise, a smaller, malformed metal arm has been added to its
right front side.  A stylish gripper built for the small arm is
capable of exerting several tons of persuasive force.  A new
computerized data link permits ease of control and dramatically
improved computer/machine coordination.

``A repeating Snot Gun, capable of firing three quarters of a gallon
of viscous liquid for 200 ft at 200 mph has been completed.
Blood-based mixtures [also containing hydroxymethylcellulose as a
disgustifying agent] used at the Barcelona show resulted in numerous
complaints from the audience.

``A meter-maid cart, modified beyond belief and radio controlled, has
had the computer-controlled Finger mountd on it and is now officially
the fastest and most berserk SRL machine ever employed.  For Barcelona
a large plastic cow was attached, painted gold and mountedupside-down, with
the Finger protruding from its anus.  Currently, it
is being reconstructed as the base for the BIBLE BURN CART.''

SRL's next performance, the first in more than a year, will be in San
Francisco, April 8th, 12:30 pm, as part of the SF MOMA groundbreaking
ritual.  It's at 151 3rd St (x Howard).  The theme of the performance
is ``SEXUALIZED WAR'' and for several reasons it is expected to be
the most spectacular SRL has produced.

Free and open to the public.  Warning: people occasionally die at SRL
performances.  Appropriate attire is recommended.  (Kevlar is a good
start.)

About parking like an american (Se garer ` l'amiricaine):

This technique consists in biting the pavement with the front wheel, during the
parking manuever. this avoids to park the car in reverse gear ('crineau', more
difficult one). I can't think of any historical reason but the relation to the
fairly large sized american cars (compared to the french one), with which
maneuvers in narrow Paris streets must not be 'une partie de plaisir'.

Subj:   Buttered Cat test results

     The strange Mr. Chis Spellman posed the question of what would happen
if you dropped a butter backed cat, given the antagonistic forces implied
by the fact that cats land on their feet while buttered bread lands on its
butter.

     We here at the test labs were not able to do as much research as we
would have liked, given cuts to the defense budget and the escape of some
of our cats early in the testing process.  If these had been intercontinental
ballistic butter-backed cats (ICBCs) we could have done much more.  We do
however have some results that I personally find interesting.

     Please excuse the informal presentation of the results, the question
seemed a bit fanciful, so we decided to publish the summarized results only.
No statistical tests of significance were performed, though it was pretty
clear from our observations that our results are likely to be repeatable.

     A cat with butter on its back lands on its feet, unless it is dropped
on bread, in which case it lands on its back.  This is true as long as the
cat is dropped from a height of at least 6 inches.  (We found it impractical
to experiment with heights greater than 26 feet but assume our findings
remain consistent for drop heights up to several thousand feet.)

     There is one exception to this law that we were able to discover.  If
you drop a cat with butter on its back onto a piece of bread that is on
the back of a dog, the cat will land on its feet on the bread.  This is
true even if the dog is buried so that its back is at ground level.  It
seems clear that this unexpected dog-cat polarity force is stronger than
the butter-bread attraction force which in turn is stronger than the cat
torque force.  This seems to be a promising avenue for further inquiry.  I
am especially curious to know what kinds of things that you can cover
the butter on the back of a cat with, in order to shield the butter-bread
attraction force. Alternatively, perhaps butter somehow neutralizes this
torque force.

     When you butter the paws of a cat and drop it, it always lands on
its feet (26 feet &gt; drop height &gt; 6 inches) whether it lands on an ordinary
surface, bread, or bread on the back of a dog.  The cat does, however, walk
in an odd manner with buttered paws.

     We also buttered the backs of two siamese cats and then glued their
backs together (with their heads at the same end).  This combination
landed upright on their four hind legs for drop heights greater than two
feet. (below 2 feet their landing attitude was somewhere between their
release attitude and the four hind leg landing)  This is true whether they
were dropped onto the ground, onto bread or onto bread that was on a dog's
back.  These cats escaped immediately after being dropped onto the bread
on the dog's back, and while that moment was rather confused, it was
amazing to see those two glued together cats running upright and back-to-
back so quickly and with such cooperation.  I recommend that everyone try
this if they have two cats, a dog and a camcorder.

     The spectacle was unquestionably one of the highlights of my
scientific career.

     Those two siamese were my last two cats so that's all the results I
have for now.

c.1992 N.Y. Times News Service
       In a discovery that overturns centuries of mathematical
tradition, a group of graduate students and young researchers has
discovered a way to check even the longest and most complicated
proof by scrutinizing it in just a few spots.
       The finding, which some mathematicians say seems almost magical,
depends upon transforming the set of logical statements that
constitute a proof into a special mathematical form in which any
error is so amplified as to be easily detectable.
       Using this new result, the researchers have already made a
landmark discovery in computer science.
       They showed that it is impossible to compute even approximate
solutions for a large group of practical problems that have long
foiled researchers.
       Even that negative finding is very significant, experts say,
because in mathematics, a negative result, showing something is
impossible, can be just as important and open just as many new
areas of research as a positive one.
       The discovery was made by Sanjeev Arora and Madhu Sudan,
graduate students at the University of California at Berkeley, Dr.
Rajeev Motwani, an assistant professor at Stanford University, and
Dr. Carsten Lund and Dr. Mario Szegedy, young computer scientists
at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.
       Motwani, who is the senior member of the group, just turned 30
on March 26.
       ``With the conventional notion of a proof, you had to check it
line by line,'' said Dr. Michael Sipser, a theoretical computer
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``An error
might be buried on page 475, line 6. A `less than or equal to'
should have been a `less than.' That would totally trash the whole
proof. But you'd have to dig through the whole thing to find it,''
Sipser said.
       Now, he added, ``the new idea is that there is a way to
transform any proof so that if there is an error, it appears almost
everywhere. I'd say, `You have a proof? Show me a page.' If there
is an error, it will be there.''
       The finding, which is built on two and a one half years work by
leading researchers, is expected to have a profound impact. But
because it is so new and unexpected, mathematicians and computer
scientists cannot yet predict its scope of application.
       ``This is philosophically important,'' said Dr. Mihalis
Yannakakis, a theoretical computer scientist at AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories.
       Dr. Manuel Blum, a mathematician at the University of California
at Berkeley, agreed that the result was ``really exciting,'' with
ramifications that were hard to predict.
       The new verification method can show up errors in calculations
as well as in proofs, experts said, and Blum suggested it could
have a role in checking long computer computations.
       Dr. Umesh Vazirani, a theoretical computer scientist at the
University of California at Berkeley, said that the discovery was
``one of the most outstanding in the past decade,'' because it
allowed investigators to decide, almost at a glance, whether it was
worthwhile to try to find an approximate solution to a problem they
were unable to solve exactly.
       ``As soon as you formulate a problem, you can know if it is
intractable,'' Vazirani said.
       The finding is so recent that it has not yet been published.
``We just wrote it in the last month or so,'' Motwani said.

(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

        As is the custom in mathematics and theoretical computer
science, the result gains credibility not by having been sent to a
journal and reviewed by other scientists but by having been vouched
for by leaders in the field. In this case, at least a dozen experts
say they are convinced by the result, and amazed by it.
       ``It is absolutely stunning,'' said Dr. Laszlo Babai, a
theoretical computer scientist at the University of Chicago whose
work helped lay the groundwork for the new discovery.
       Dr. Richard Karp, a theoretical computer scientist at the
University of California at Berkeley agreed. ``Personally, to me
it's very surprising,'' he said.
       Karp added that the method's application to show that certain
problems have no approximate solutions is the most important
discovery in his field of theoretical computer science in more than
two decades.
       The insight into the nature of proofs shows how a connection can
be created between each and every logical statement of a proof, no
matter how long or complicated the proof may be.
       It applies to the 15,000-page proof that is the longest ever
published as well as to the single sentence proof that can be
grasped in an instant. And it is no harder to check a long proof
than a short one.
       ``Even if your proof is the size of the universe, you still
would not have an increased number of places to check,'' Babai
said.

title: UNDATED: Babai said.
text:

       The investigators used a variety of mathematical tricks to
transform a proof so that its errors, if any, will show up almost
everywhere. One method they used was a way of comparing lists of
data.
       Data comparisons are an integral part of long proofs. For
example, Babai pointed out, a typical mathematical proof might have
a line that says, ``We know by theorem 31 that a equals b and by
theorem 72 that b equals c. Therefore, we conclude that a equals
c.''
       To see if this statement is correct, Babai said, ``We have to go
back to theorem 31 and see that it does indeed say b equals c, and
similarly we have to look up theorem 72 and see that it has been
copied correctly.''
       One way to compare two lists of numbers is to arrange them in a
grid and then extend each row and column in an arithmetic
progression.
       To compare the data list 1,3,-1,4 with 1,5,-1,4, in which a
single digit has been miscopied, the lists would be formed into
arrays with 1,3 and 1,5 in the top rows.
       The rows would then be extended in arithmetic progression,
forming 1,3,5,7,9,11 and 1,5,7,9,11,13. Already the one-digit
difference has been amplified to five differences.
       By increasing the number of items listed in the arrays, the
number of differences in an extended array can be made so great
that sampling just a few squares will be bound to detect a
difference and thus an error in one of the original data sets.
       Proofs are not data but they can be manipulated in analogous
ways by representing each step of a proof as a term in a
mathematical equation.
       For example, Arora said, a logical statement in a typical proof
might say ``either statement x and statement y are true, or
statement z is not true.'' This can be converted to the equation,
xy pluas (1-z).
       Using these equations, the mathematicians formulated
relationships that would have to hold if the proof contained no
error.
       Blum said that the new finding does have in it an intrinsic
uncertainty. An error will show up in almost everywhere in a
suitably transformed proof, but not absolutely everywhere. But, he
said, it is easy to probe the proof in enough places to make the
chance of missing the error negligible.
       ``Realistically, you can make the probability of missing an
error as small as 1 divided by the number of atoms in the
universe,'' Blum said. That means you can make the chance of
mistaking an incorrect proof for a correct one, ``virtually zero,''
he said.
       The investigators also noticed that their proof was
mathematically equivalent to a profound statement of how difficult
it would be to solve certain problems that plague mathematicians.
       Their proof about proofs showed that it was just as hard to get
an approximate solution to a class of very hard problems as it was
to get an exact solution.
       Since computer scientists have pretty much given up on exact
solutions to these problems, the new result means they must abandon
even their remaining shreds of hope of obtaining rough solutions to
a wide group of practical problems.
       This group of thousands of problems involves finding the best
ways to do things like design telephone networks or airline routes
or to set up sequences of jobs in factories.
       Although no one has ever proved that an exact solution is
impossible, the consensus is that they are. Babai said
mathematicians had tried for centuries to find an exact solution,
to no avail.
       ``Literally thousands of people have considered these problems,
including the greatest minds in mathematics, including Gauss, and
have gotten nowhere,'' he said, referring to Karl F. Gauss, an
18th-century German mathematician and astronomer.
       In 1971, investigators showed that a wide range of these very
hard problems were mathematically equivalent: a solution to one
would solve all. Without hope of an exact solution that would solve
them all the time, they began a search for an approximate solution
that would always come very close, at least, to the best answer.
       Babai explained: ``There was a feeling that, `All right, we are
not interested in the best possible solution. If we can get within
1 percent of an exact solution, that's good enough.' ''
       Investigators found some good approximate solutions that worked
for some problems some of the time, but they could not find a good
approximation that would always work.
       Now they know there is a reason for that. The solutions they
were seeking were as hard to find as exact solutions.
       Karp said this finding alone was a monumental achievement,
equivalent in its impact to the finding in 1971 that the problems
were equivalent. Until now, he said, ``One could always cling to
the hope that one could get what one wanted with a fast algorithm
that gives a good approximation. Now we know that even that is
unachievable.''

In the info-mac digest there's been a recent thread about the words
that spelling checkers suggest as replacements for words that they
don't recognize.  A Japanese-American (Gann Matsuda) pointed out that
MS Word 5.0 had suggested "Nips" as a replacement for "Nisei", which
is a Japanese word for Japanese-Americans.  His posting was pretty
level-headed, merely pointing out that some folks might take offense
at this.  There was a strong negative reaction publicly in the digest,
suggestions that he "lighten up", and apparently he received some
private Japanese-bashing hate-mail.  Pretty unpleasant all around, but
there have been some amusing aspects.  The most recent shot was:

Subject: Some people have too much time on their hands

Hey everyone!!  Did you know that Microsoft is advocating the killing of
Jews in New York City?  I sure didn't!  But it's true!  I read it in the
paper!

Get ready for a whopper.  Once again the news media proves that it doesn't
know the first thing about computers.  The entire story, retransmitted
without permission, is below, as it appeared in today's New York Post.

For those who don't know, the Post is a tabloid paper, where the entire front
page is one huge headline.  So, screaming out at millions of New Yorkers this
morning was the headline, "PROGRAM OF HATE".  Above the headline is a photo
of one of those old PC green-screen displays, with "NYC" = &lt;skull&gt; &lt;Star of
David&gt; &lt;thumbs-up sign&gt; superimposed on the screen.  Above that is a
subheadline, "Millions of computers carry secret message that urges death to
Jews in New York City..."

So, without further ado, here's the story:

ANTI-JEWISH CODE LURKS IN POPULAR SOFTWARE, by Don Broderick

 One of the world's best-selling computer programs contains a secret anti-
Semitic message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City.
 A computer consultant discovered the diabolic message while installing
Microsoft's new Windows 3.1 software for a client yesterday.
 The consultant was testing a mailing-address use of the program when he
noticed the letters "NYC" had been replaced by a hateful message - a skull
and crossbones, the Star of David and an approving thumbs-up symbol.
 Microsoft strongly denies any hidden message.  Others disagree.
 "There's no way it could be a random coincidence," said Brian Young, a
friend of the consultant, who does not wish to be named.
 "It's pretty scary.  I was pretty shocked by the whole thing."
 Computer owners who use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word or any other
Microsoft program containing a print font named "Wingdings" can duplicate
the anti-Semitic message by typing the letters "NYC" on their screen.
 Microsoft said "Wingdings" was designed by Bigelow and Holmes, an outside
vendor, and denied that Microsoft intentionally designed the secret
message.
 Prof. Charles Bigelow confirmed that his company provided the symbols, but
insisted that Microsoft made the final "mapping" decisions assigning his
symbols to specific keys on the keyboard.
 But a senior Microsoft spokesman said the charge that the fonts contain a
hidden message is "outrageous."
 "It's like saying that if you randomly type out characters on a keyboard to
spell 'Satan', you can do that, but it's incredible to say that there's anti-
Semitism in Microsoft or one of its vendors," said Charles Hemingway.
 But Young, who discussed the matter with other computer consultants, isn't
so sure it's just a coincidence.
 The "Wingdings" font contains no letters - just 255 symbols.
 Young calculated the odds of three letters of the alphabet being combined
with 255 symbols, and said he found that the odds of obtaining the message
were less than one in a trillion.
 "It's mind-blowing," said Young.  "Somebody's responsible for this.  This
is very offensive."
 "I found it hard to believe some of the stories about the resurgence of
Nazi sympathizers - but this puts things back into perspective."
 Microsoft, based in Seattle, is the world's biggest software publisher,
with 100 million customers around the world and sales of more than $2.3
billion in 1991.
 When Windows 3.0 was introduced in 1990, customers were snapping it up at
the rate of 30,000 a week.

-- end of article

Above the story is a line of some of the various symbols in the "Wingdings"
font, with the caption:  "LOADED: When a specific font is used in Microsoft's
Windows, these symbols, which correspond to the alphabet, appear.  Type the
letters NYC, you get the death sign, the Star of David and the thumbs-up."

So what do you all think?  Should me load up the buses and make a pilgrimage
to Redmond to firebomb Bill Gates's mansion, or what?

        Um, er, um, ah, fellows and girls . . . My master plan to create a
        pool of Desperado submissions resulted in a file of about 6000
        lines.  A recent flurry of activity boosted it to about 8000
        lines.  Unfortunately (or maybe not) the first 6000 lines were
        deleted in a stupid operator error.  I was the stupid operator.

        So, you can add one more to the list of reasons why that hilarious
        thing you sent me never ended up in Desperado.  The reasons that
        stuff sent to me doesn't make it to the list includes:

                - Ran it already in a previous Desperado

                - Didn't understand it (this doesn't always stop me)

                - Wasn't hilarious that day and there I was poised with
                  my finger on the D key

                - Much circulated by others and therefore not needing my
                  assistance

                - Too Digital

                - Lost in the POOL.TXT purge of April 1992

        Alas, I am tormented by what was lost, but ever so slightly
        relieved at not having to make several hundred as yet unmade
        decisions.  On the other hand, I used up about half of what was
        left on this ish.  Keep 'em coming and I'll try not to lose 'em.
