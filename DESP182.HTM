Well, Desperados, they don't usually come so fast and thick as this, but if
they hadn't been coming so slow in the past few weeks they wouldn't be coming
so fast now, one of those paradoxes so beloved of we intellectuals, right?

This is a special, prevacation backlog compilation and closet-cleaning issue
of this little thing we like to call Desperado.

Most of these are from the never-actually-sent legendary April Fool's issue.

Subj:   Important Product Announcement from DEC

An unidentified source at Digital Equipment Corporation has revealed major
DCL-related product announcements scheduled for release on April 1 by the Merry
Mites of Maynard.

The first important revelation is the development of a DEC-supported DCL
compiler.  The source said that the new product, called DCL On-Line Performance
Enhancer, DOPE for short, reads in standard DCL command procedures and
translates them to a variant of VAX-11 BASIC.  The resultant source code then
can be compiled and linked using the new dialect BASIC Adaptive Recombinant
Formatter (BARF).

The source, who refused to be identified, said the most difficult part of the
project was modifying VAX-11 BASIC into the new BARF language.  "DEC software
engineers greatly underestimated the amount of time it would take to remove
floating point capability," he reported.  "Stripping out the ELSE and WHILE
statements was a real bear, too."

In conjunction with the DOPE and BARF releases, the source revealed that DEC
also has added several new lexical functions to the DCL repertoire. Some of the
newer capabilities, which should be incorporated into VMS V4.601, include:

F$ENVIRONMENT("PERFORMANCE")-
This function performs an instant analysis of system performance, using
advanced artificial intelligence techniques.  The unidentified source said that
unlike other lexicals, which use VAX/VMS System Services, this function
actually invokes an expert system developed internally by DEC. "The problem is
that the expert system wasn't written by the VMS team -- it was written by
Sales.  The function always returns the string, 'BUY AN 8800'."

F$GEGDVI("device","LITIGATION")-
"DEC's decided to become even more aggressive in pursuing third-party vendors
who infringe on the VAX BI bus."  This lexical, imbedded in the system startup
command file, polls each device connected to the BI bus to determine if any
"foreign invaders" are on the system.  If non-DEC hardware is discovered, the
system automatically calls out via the RDC line to a team of lawyers on 24-hour
standby at DEC's support site in Colorado Springs.  If the customer hasn't
subscribed to the Remote Diagnostics facility, the system will not boot and
will print out the message "No Hablo Bogus BI" on the console device.

F$GETSYI("LICENSE_POLICY")
The recent controversy over the transfer of VMS licenses has prompted DEC to
reassure some user sites on an almost daily basis.  To reduce costs associated
with the massive influx of calls and letters, DEC added this function to
provide online information about the current VMS licensing policy. Calls to the
function return various string values, including "YES", "NO", "HMM...THAT'S A
GOOD QUESTION", and "KEN WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT."

F$COOKIE()-
The widespread popularity of "Fortune Cookie" software (programs that display
cute messages to users at login) has prompted DEC to provide this built-in
message generation capability.  A sample of the text returned by calls to this
function include "Digital Has It Now (but its on back-order)," "We Don't
Comment on Unannounced Products," "It's Not A Bug, It's A Feature," and "Will
Be Fixed In A Forthcoming Release Of VMS."

In conjunction with the introduction of F$COOKIE(), DEC has announced "Sayings
of Chairman Ken," a new release from Digital Press ($39.95, softcover).

Several major enhancements to VMS security also are upcoming as a result of
DEC's continued success in selling  to various Department of Defense (DoD)
agencies.  In direct response to Pentagon specs, look for an upcoming version
of VMS to contain an /INVISIBLE qualifier to the PRINT command which should
help users protect unauthorized personnel from reading sensitive printouts.
Also, watch for enhancements to the DECtalk interface, including "whisper" and
"mumble" functions.

To further enhance security, all users have NL: as their default device. "It
creates some file maintenance problems," our source revealed, "but the data is
absolutely secure, incremental backups are a snap, and the I/O is too fast to
be believed."

No firm release date has been set for this security package.  "The resulting
systems are so secure, DoD can't figure out how to log in.  DEC's scouring the
hacker BBSs for free-lance consulting help to resolve the problem."

Two other actions planned by DEC, while not directly related to system
operation, also should make life easier for managers and users:

1.  The announcement of a change to a long-rumored policy, whereby DEC will
alter the manner in which it reimburses its technical writers for creating VMS
documentation.  While the new method wasn't revealed, our inside source
confirms that DEC has abandoned its old payment procedure, which was based on
the number of pounds of documentation produced.

2.  The acknowledgement of user unhappiness with constant modification to
various operating systems, high-level languages and layered software products.
DEC therefor, will, at a alight premium, offer to support those sites wanting
to continue operations with "old" software.  Look for a selection box on future
maintenance agreements where users can choose between "New Code" and "Classic
Code."

Subj:   Ada Replacement Announced

                          DoD Abandons Ada

In a surprise move, the Department of Defense today abandoned its push toward
the ADA programming language standard.  Shell-shocked defense-related companies
are scrambling to respond to this unexpected maneuver.

According to the DoD, ADA was regarded by the White House as being "too wimpy"
for American computers to use, and so the Department was withdrawing its
support for the language.

Instead, a new computer language (tentatively named "RAMBO-TRAN" - Raw
AlgorithMetic Binary Operations TRANsitional Language) will be required for all
future DoD contracts.

RAMBO-TRAN is reportedly a column-dependent, unstructured computer language
which relies heavily on JUMP statements, denial returns, and arithmetic IF's.

All statements must start in column 1, eliminating the possibility of indenting
source code.  Although character strings are supported, they are limited to a
maximum of 4 letter words.

Perhaps the most controversial feature of the new computer language is that
RAMBO-TRAN does not support comments.  (As Casper Ghostberger puts it "Comments
make it easy for the commie spies to steal and decipher our Software.")

Asked if the lack of comments wouldn't make software maintenance considerably
more difficult, Ghostberger replied that "real" programmers don't like to
comment anyway.  (In a related move, there are apparently efforts being made on
Capitol Hill to link the words `comment' and `commie'.)

Unlike most current programming languages which offer extensive error-checking
capabilities, RAMBO-TRAN makes no provision for errors ("Real programmers don't
make errors" aserts a source within the Department of Defense.)

Instead, the programmer initially targets a "mission" for his task; then if an
unexpected error arises, the program begins performing immediate "GOTO"
operations, all designed to bring the program closer to that ultimate goal,
whatever it may be.

If the program is nevertheless thwarted from performing its mission, it
self-destructs (taking as many other programs with it as possible).

In a related move the Apple Computer Corporation announced that it had already
met 80 percent of the RAMBO-TRAN standards, particularly those involving
self-destruction.  The company is reportedly gearing up for an expected
increase in DoD supported business.

GALACTIC HACKER PARTY

                2nd, 3rd, 4th of August 1989
                                 PARADISO, AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND

During the summer of 1989 the world as we know it will go into overload.
An interstellar particle stream of hackers, phone phreaks, radioactivists
and assorted technological subversives will be fusing their energies into a
media melt-down as the global village plugs into Amsterdam for three
electrifying days of information interchange and electronic capers.

Aided by the advanced communications technology to which they are accustomed,
the hacker forces will discuss strategies, play games, and generally have a
good time.  Free access to permanently open on-line facilities will enable them
to keep in touch with home base -- wherever that is.

Those who rightly fear the threat of information tyranny and want to learn what
they can do about it are urgently invited to interface in Amsterdam in August.
There will be much to learn from people who know.  Celebrity guests with
something to say will be present in body or electronic spirit.

The Force must be nurtured.  If you are refused transport because your laptop
looks like a bomb, cut off behind enemy lines, or unable to attend for any
other reason, then join us on the networks.  Other hacker groups are requested
to organize similar gatherings to coincide with ours.  We can provide low-cost
international communications links during the conference.

        The Vegetable Computer was invented in 1842 by Charles
Cabbage, regarded by many as the father of the field.  Cabbage called
his computer the Agricultural Engine.  Modern versions consist of rose
and rose of integrated carrots connected to a flower supply by a maize
of wires.  Input is from pea switches, yard weeder, and tell-he's-ripe.
A hayseed vine printer may be used to generate hard coffee, while a
vegetable display unit supports interactive composting.  Main memory
consists of interleaved beet-addressable magnetic corn.  Secondary
store consists of plough discs and grape drives.  All peripherals are
daisy chained.

        A later version of the Agricultural Engine was known as AR-16
(after Agricultural Revolution).  It was based on the sack discipline,
first perfected by the Barrow Combine, and sprouted a high-swede paper
tape reaper for the first lime.

        Early computers consumed large amounts of power.  Many required
their own electric spud-station to seed them and had to overcome the
problem of providing adequate Lentilation.  Such problems caused many a
furrowed brow in the pasture and we cannot expect to avoid harrowing
days ahead.  However, the many fertile minds that constitute the rate-
of-the-cart computer technology cannot fail to produce the harvest of
the future, particularly with the bloom of very large scale irrigation.
Artificial pollination techniques grafted on paralleled earthworms will
soon be producing computers proudly proclaiming "I think, therefore I
yam."  All chokes aside, we can look beyond the melon-cauli thymes through
the winnow of the ears till the salad days ahead.  Lettuce advance to the
world to two marrows. To those reactionaries who would turn back the docks
we say, "hoe! hoe! hoe!".

Subject: Hackers dictionary in Japanese?

I received an off-the-wall phone call last night from an editor who is
overseeing the translation of the Hackers Dictionary into Japanese.  That
amusing compilation was put together a decade or so ago by A.I.  grad students
at Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie-Mellon and recorded the then-current vernacular
of their shared cultures.  They did it for fun, but it somehow ended up getting
published.

The Hackers' Dictionary contains more than a few puns, jokes, and other things
that are hard to translate such as "moby," as in "moby memory", or "fubar" and
its regional variants "foo bar" and "foo baz".  While a Japanese version of
this dictionary might be of some limited value to a person who comes to the
U.S. for an extended visit, there are clearly some risks involved in attempting
such a translation.

The particular problem that prompted the call was the definition of "logical."
Apparently the dictionary gives as an example a statement something like "If
Les Earnest left and was replaced by another person, the latter would be known
as the logical Les Earnest."  This had been written when I was the principal
bureaucrat of the Stanford A.I. Lab. and was apparently intended to describe
some set of responsibilities that could be transferred from one person to
another.

The editor reported that the Japanese translator had been hopelessly confused
by this example; he found "earnest" in the dictionary but was unable to figure
out what a "Les Earnest" was.  The editor had tried to explain it to him but
was unable to get the idea across.  He finally called me to find out what my
official job title had been, so that he could describe the example in more
generic terms.

I hope that they manage to work it out, but I am not willing to bet that the
Japanese Hackers Dictionary will be fully comprehensible.
                                                                Les Earnest

&gt;From the April edition of Computer Language (p.31). Thought it was
worth passing on:

The software crisis many observers such as Ed Yourdon have been
chronicling has finally reached the attention of the nation's
lawmakers. Congressman A.F.Day has introduced legislation that would
make Ada the official language of the United States. "This legislation
is intended to increase the software productivity of American
programmers," said Day. "When we are faced with increasing competition
from foreign programmers, it becomes essential to concentrate our
resources where they will do the most good." Day's bill establishes
civil and criminal penalties for any programmer who uses archaic
languages like Fortran, Basic, or C. If you have comments about this
legislation, write to the Honorable A.F.Day, 401 Rayburn Office Bdg.,
Washington D.C. 04189.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                 _LadySMith: the 'elegant' handgun_

Ladies, you wouldn't use a man's deodorant, so why use a man's
revolver?  You want a revolver that's lightweight, with no edges to
catch on your nails, a dainty revolver that still packs a punch.
Maybe you want a .38-calibre LadySmith.

Smith &amp; Wesson, the Springfield, Mass., firearms manufacturer, is
introducing the first-ever line of "elegant" women's handguns, called
LadySmiths -- in glossy blue, or frosted sterling, with your choice of
barrel lengths.

A promotion brochure depicts a fur coat, a yellow rose and a LadySmith
handgun.  "Just possibly," a LadySmith brochure states, "an ideal
answer to a very contemporary need."

Recognizing that most women are intimidated by macho gun talk, Smith &amp;
Wesson is also hooking up a toll-free hot line, staffed by what the
brochure calls a "real, live, knowledgable woman."

Other weapons manufacturers have dabbled in the women's handgun market
before, but Smith &amp; Wesson's efforts are thought to be the largest and
most serious of their kind.

"In the past couple of years, we've seen other manufacturers come out
with things like pastel grips, which have supposedly done well,
sales-wise," said Sonny Jones, editor of "Women &amp; Guns", a Hot
Springs, Ark., newsletter that debuted last week.

Several Conde Nast magazines, including Mademoiselle, Glamour, and
Self, have said they won't accept the ads.  "Each magazine made its
own decision about that," said Eileen Roper Ast, a Conde Nast
Publications spokeswoman.

Meredith Group's Better Homes &amp; Gardens and Woman's Day also said they
will reject the ads.

But Smith &amp; Wesson says the as will run in other magazines, beginning
in April, including Ladies Home Journal, Cosmopolitan, McCall's,
Redbook, Harper's Bazaar and Working Mother.

"Who knows?" said Smith &amp; Wesson spokeswoman Sherry Collins. "Next
year, we could be looking at TV."

[...]  the LadySmith concept is gaining admirers, including Sarah
LePere, owner of "Feminine Protection By Sarah", a Texas company that
makes 11 styles of women's purses with concealed handgun compartments.

"They're very beautiful," LePere said of the the LadySmiths.  "And, I
would think, handy.  We don't sell guns at our store, but I've had so
many women asking what type of gun, if I were to buy one, what I would
use."

"Of course," she added, "I always tell them that, personally, I would
recommend a small revolver, such as the Smith &amp; Wesson.  I carry a
model .36 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver myself, as opposed to an automatic."

"To me, an automatic is a thinking person's gun.  She has to remember
to take off the safety and put the clip in before she's ready to
shoot.  And then there's the jacket.  With a small revolver like the
LadySmith, all she has to do is pull the trigger, if there should be
an emergency."

A woman handgun owner without a special purse is just asking for
trouble, LePere contended.  "You will end up with cracker crumbs and
mints in the barrel, or tobacco, if you smoke, or anything else that
accumulates in the bottom of a lady's handbag," she said.

Her purses can accommodate up to a 5-inch-long barrel, and then, for
that cocktail party-size gun, LePere makes evening bags, with optional
gold straps, and "a touch of snakeskin," for $89.95.

In article &lt;8317@xanth.cs.odu.edu&gt; ford%cs.odu.edu writes:
&gt; Dear fellow netlanders:
&gt; I need some information.  Until approximantly 3 weeks ago, I had been
&gt; a fairly regular marijuana smoker.  Due to my imminent graduation, and
&gt; subsequent job search, I new that I would have to stop.  Well, the
&gt; realization did not hit me until I received an itinerary in the mail for
&gt; an out of town interview which included a drug screening release.  My
&gt; first response was, "Oh my God, what am I going to do?  Is all this hard
&gt; work going to go to waste?"

Not to worry, ford.  Remember that even some Supreme Court nominees
have admitted to experimenting with the Devil's Weed in their wild
and naive youth.  The important thing is that you have realized in
time that your body is not your personal property.  It, together with
your heart and soul, belong to corporate America to do with as it sees
fit in the noble quest to increase the Gross National Profits.  Just
remember when asked to fill that specimen bottle, it's not that your
future employer doesn't trust you, he just needs some *confidential*
information for his files.

&gt; After the initial shock wore off, I new that I need some solid advice and
&gt; information.  That is why I have turned to you, my fellow net users.

Solid advice on how to impress your future bosses:  spell the past tense
of 'know' as 'knew', not 'new'.  Now you know.

&gt; I need *SOLID* and factual answers to the following questions.  One other
&gt; fact that needs to be shared; I have used cocaine two times in the past
&gt; year, the last time being just before Christmas.

Thanks for sharing that with us, ford.  So you had a little "White Christmas"
last year, eh?  Too bad - even if you could clean up your body, you'll never
be able to cleanse your soul.  You're a coke addict; you'd best admit it.

&gt; 1)  How long does it take for marijuana to leave the system (taking to account
&gt;     my regularity)?  I have heard a month.

Bad knews for you, fnord.  Once consumed, marijuana never completely leaves
the system, even if you're a real regular guy.  THC concentration may have
a half life of a few hours, but even after a year, it is still measurable
using sophisticated molecular spectroscopy techniques.  Better admit that
that you are a reformed hophead.  Tell them you found Jesus or something.

&gt; 2)  Is the cocaine use going to be a problem?  The two times that I used it
&gt;     this past year were the first and only times.

As already mentioned, there is no such thing as 'casual' cocaine use.  The
fact that you HAD to go back and use it a second time should be enough to
convince you of that.

&gt; 3)  Is there anything that I can do to speed up the process of the drugs
&gt;     leaving my system?  I have heard that drinking copious amounts of
&gt;     fluids would help.

Try a complete blood transfusion.  If that doesn't work, try sitting through
ten showings of Ron and Nancy's classic, "Hellcats of the Navy".

&gt; 4)  Would a hospital or clinic preform a *CONFIDENTIAL* test for me?  If so,
&gt;     how about cost?

Sorry, the DEA had to cancel medical confidentiality last month.  It was
an inevitable casuality of the WoD.  You might as well turn yourself in
to the nearest law enforcement agency.  They'll do it for free.

&gt; Any advice or information that you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

Don't worry.  I can tell by your apologetic tone that you've got your mind
right now.  Just remember to "Just Say NO!" [(c) 1987, the Wod], except when
the man in the white coat hands you the bottle.  Then it's "Piss With Pride!"
[(c) 1989, the WoD].

    Digital, Tufted Medical Center - New Medical Application announced

    Digital and Tufted Medical Center announced a joint venture to develop a
    VMS- and Ultrix-based medical application.  This application will provide
    a networked, interactive, menu-driven tool for delivering immediate
    on-site relief for common maladies like colds, flu, muscle aches, hay
    fever, and joggers' itch.

    Code-named VAXinnate, the product will allow a sick user to enter the
    symptoms on a series of menus.  The user will then position the affected
    body part, modesty notwithstanding, adjacent to the terminal's exhaust
    fan and press the INSERT HERE key for online relief.

    Some additional hardware will need to be installed on each terminal.

Subj:   end of the world news reports (in re Desperado #2010)

Regarding how various newspapers would report the end of the world, the Boston
Globe would use the headline:

        Hub, Rest of World to End Tomorrow

                                        =*=
