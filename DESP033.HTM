RE: parts of spreech and dictionries (sic: stet)

First, the greatest dictionary in English may be the OED, although you
could go crazy if that's all you had to use. (You could also develop
Schwarzeneggerian muscles, but ...) The greatest AMERICAN dictionary,
suh, is the Merriam-Webster's New International --  2nd edition,
usually referred to as Webster II. For confirmation of this assertion,
I refer you to the essay "The String Untuned", by the late Dwight
Macdonald, in AGAINST THE AMERICAN GRAIN (Random House). Macdonald's
essay, along with defenses of Webster III (by Bergen Evans, et al.)
are reprinted in an anthology called DICTIONARIES AND THAT DICTIONARY.
(When Webster III appeared, there was a lot of academic feudin and
fussin.)

Webster II was the preferred dictionary of Nero Wolfe. There is a
delightful scene in the beginning of one of the Wolfe books in which
the fat man burns a copy of the then-new (and still reprehensible)
Webster III. Wolfe had the right idea.

Dictionaries both prescribe and describe the language. Or rather, some
describe and some prescribe. The ultimate in descriptive dictionaries
is the OED, I guess. Webster II, being a more practical thingumabob,
does some description (historical semantics, etymology), but, unlike
Webster III, it attempts to prescribe usage --- according to what
educated speakers use. Prescriptions are not necessarily bad --- so
long as they do not become ossified or autocratic. Usage is the final
arbiter of correctness, just as might is finally the arbiter of right.
God is on the side of the big battalions; lately, the big battalions
seems to think there is no difference between "deprecate" and
"depreciate" or "disinterested"and "uninterested". Maybe we will
eventually lose the distinctions between those words, as we have lost
the distinctions between other words. Nero Wolfe abominated the use of
"contact" as a verb --- a usage which seems handy, if not utterly
correct, nowadays.

There is no automatic resolution to these disputes: in the words of
old Tom Eliot -- you remember Tom? skinny guy, played with cats,
always hoping it would rain -- "There is no method except to be very
intelligent". The makers of Webster II were more intelligent than the
makers of Webster III. The makers of, say, the American-Heritage try
to be intelligent --- the usage panel of notables, for example.
Abandoning attempts to influence usage intelligently --- and that is
pretty much what Webster III does -- is at best intellectual laziness,
and at worst intellectual treason. The use of "hopefully" as a sentence
adverb --- to purists: the misuse of hopefully as a dangling modifier
--- is (a) a lost cause, and (b) not worth fighting over anyway. (Cf.
the entry on "hopefully" in the OED. Let history judge, as Old Nick
Lenin would say.) The misuse of "infer" for "imply" is another matter, and
should be a capital crime. (I'm more lenient about misuisng
"disinterested" for "uninterested" --- let's make that twenty years at
hard labor: say, reading the later novels of Henry James.)

Are parts of speech part of the language? Well, yes, in a way, to Noam
Chomsky, et al. But whatever way that is is irrelevant. The real
question seems to be, Are the words you and I and everyone else use
being used correctly? Correctly, of course, is going to mean different
things to different people. None of us live in the lofty philological
climes inhabited by Chomsky &amp; co. (When Chomsky dies, he, like Hegel,
will have been understood by only three men: one, who went mad;
another, who understood, but forgot; and a third, who understand and
disagreed.) Ultimately, there is nothing wrong in one of my former
students at Dorchester High saying "When you be going to the store..."
That, after all, is correct English on Geneva Avenue, much as shooting
someone in the back is correct behavior in a combat zone, but frowned
upon in polite society on the home front.

If you say the food in the cafeteria is "gub" I might or might not
know what you mean. Maybe, buried in the bowels of the seventh-letter
entries of the OED, there is a word "gub," meaning "egregiously
incomestible." Or, if the word is a personal coinage, maybe I'll
figure out what you mean from your facial expression, tone, phsysical
and gestures. I might also figure it out from the nature of the food
in the cafeteria. It's easy to invent new nouns, new verbs, new
adjectives, new adverbs. It's harder to invent new instances of other
parts of speech: We haven't adopted "ter" yet as a gender-free
pronoun for the third person singular; we can't very easily create a
new preposition "ock" to mean half on, half off (as "The book is OCK
the table"), even though such a preposition would be very handy. This
has something to do with the structure of the language --- the
Chomskian "deep structures," the parts of speech that are inherently
within the language.

Finally, the last word goes to Samuel Johnson, as always:
Dictionaries, he told Boswell, are like watches. The worst of them is
better than none, and the best of them cannot be trusted to go right
all the time.

Sorry for the harangue.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
At the time of the Webster's II v. Webster's III controversy, the New
York Times ran an impassioned editorial defense of the grand old
Webster's II.  Someone figured out that there were 50 words in the
editorial not defined in Webster's II that were defined in Webster's
III.

The "usage panel" of the American Heritage is a bunch of pretty fair
writers who do a Chicken Little routine whenever a word like
"hopefully" or "contact" as a verb comes along.

It's easy to invent new nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs because
these are the parts of speech that don't exist, as in my original
question, "What part of speech is 'dog'?"  It is any part you want it
to be:

        "my dog"="noun"                 "dogged his trail"="verb"
        "dogged determination"="adj"    "doggedly"="adv"

And don't hassle me about the suffixes; they're "deep structure",
doggone it.

Subject: The linguist in me couldn't resist

The debate you've been having about sentence structure and grammar
rules really has to do with how traditional English grammar was first
developed.

The "grammar" that we are usually taught in elementary school dates back
to the 18th century, when the first real grammars of the English language
were written in England by such classical grammarians and rhetoricians
as Robert Lowth and John Ash. These grammars were based on the formal
grammars of Latin and Greek, and their primary purpose was to systematize
the use of language by teaching "rules" and establishing "standards". These
grammarians believed that by teaching strict grammar they could bring
the language back to its Shakespearean heyday and thereby uplift the culture.

Lowth (and others)  was a classical hardhat. If an everyday sentence or phrase
worked within his prescribed rules, fine. If it didn't, he advocated not using
it. His grammar was more of a Miss Manners Guide to the Language rather than a
scientific study of syntax, morphology, and semantics. Ever ask yourself why
you're not supposed to split infinitives? Well, one of these neoclassical
grammarians thought it would be nice if English verbs acted like Latin verbs.
That the English have been splitting infinitives since Stonehenge didn't
matter. It just didn't fit the Greek model.

The most influential grammar written by an American at that time was "A
Grammatical Institute of the English Language" written by Noah Webster and
published in 1784. Webster ripped off much of what the English wrote, and
further, he made a fortune selling grammars and spelling primers to the
American school system.

All of this is a way to explain that traditional English grammar was based
on dead (non-spoken) classical languages, evangalized by English gentility,
ripped off by an American huckster, and drilled into the heads of American
school kids whose parents have equated "civilized" with the British upper
class for four hundred years.

A request of all you Desperadi out there -- how about tossing out your favorite
collective nouns?  While you're at it, what does one call a gathering of
Desperadi?  A "babble"?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
This is a grand old word game, based on the fact that while cows come
in herds and chickens in flocks, geese come in gaggles.  So you have a
school of fish, a pride of lions, a murder of crows, or a squad of
policemen.  My favorite made-up one is a fanfare of strumpets.

There's never been a gathering of Desperados, but babble of Desperados
might be a name for it, or a network of Desperados, or a correspondence
of Desperados.  The Germans have great word, Briefwechsel, that means
"exchange of letters", so maybe it's a briefwechsel of Desperadi.

Speaking of dippy plurals, I have never heard any Deckie use VAXen as

Subject: What the phone company's been doing with all the money we've given it

For those of you who think the phone company has been asleep the past few
years, think again.  The latest issue of ELECTRONICS (29-Dec-1982) has a
story about what American Bell, Inc., the unregulated offshoot of AT&amp;T, is
up to.

First, they have a consumer products division, which is taking over the
nationwide network of PhoneCenter stores on January 1.  It will acquire
essentially the entire product line of the stores.  Company officials are
also hinting that they may add home computers and cellular mobile phones to
the products the stores sell.  They are out to make American Bell "the
market leader in home and business communications and information-management
systems.

But the big news is from the Advanced Information Systems division.
They've just announced their system called Net 1000, which is scheduled to
begin commercial service early next year.  Net 1000 is essentially a
nationwide computer service bureau, that lets subscribers do interactive
processing in the network's computers.  Subscriber data and programs may be
stored in the network's memory, and the information shipped anywhere in the
nationwide system.  "In a sense, the system will act as a universal
computer allowing customers with incompatable systems ranging from simple
data terminals to very large mainframes to communicate with each other."

It uses IBM Series/1 mainframes as the user-interface machines (these are
what the subscribers talk to), connected to the network nodes, which are
VAX-11/780s.  At least two 780s serve a mainframe (for redundancy).  The
780s are connected together via an interprocessor bus for local
connections, and a packet switched net for remote connections.  The net has
been designed to be hardware-independent, so there will be room to add in
the "computers that AT&amp;T's Western Electric will presumably put on the
market someday."

Net 1000 is also the first public net to cover the lower five levels in the
ISO protocol model.  So, only the applications and presentation layers need
be considered by the user.

Also, customers may access Net 1000 directly in a high-level language.
Here, Bell may have made its biggest mistake:  they chose COBOL, in order
to take advantage of substantial user experience and previously written
applications software.

In other marital matters, I sat today at The Magic Pan, having lunch
and getting quietly sloshed on bad white wine, and eavesdropped on one
of life's amazing computer conversations:  Two very well dressed and
trendy women, early forties, (age, not dress) were discussing the urge
of the husband one of one of them to buy a DIGITAL computer as offered
on special sale.  The future computer owner was complaining about the
expense, and how it was "just a toy he wanted to play with",  Her
friend said, "well, at least it isn't another woman",  First woman said,
"another woman might be cheaper, after he buys all the SOFTWARE he needs
to run it."  This may be yet another great marketing gimmick:  buy MICRO/RSX
...it's cheaper than a chippie.

The following appeared in New York Magazine (November 29th issue; I happened
to read it recently):

            "Casablanca" may be a Hollywood classic, but it wouldn't stand
        much of a chance in today's Tinseltown, according to an investigation
        by a Los-Angeles writer.
            Chuck Ross sent the script of the 1942 picture to the 217 agents
        suggested by the Writers Guild of America as go-betweens with the
        major studios, which won't read independently submitted projects.  He
        called the work "Everybody Comes to Rick's", the title of the play on
        which "Casablanca" was based, Ross explains in a story that will
        appear in next month's issue of "Film Comment".
            "Only 33 agents recognized what they were reading, and another 41
        rejected it outright," he told "New York". The Trejos Literary Agency,
        for instance, said, "Try for a script that has audience identification
        and one that can be filmed in the U.S.," while the Larry Karlin Agency
        said the project didn't "grab" it.  Three agents told an astonished
        Ross that they didn't handle unsolicited material.
            "Hollywood agents don't know what's good.  It's the same as with
        publishers," said Ross.  Indeed, when he typed out Jerzy Kosinski's
        "Steps" and sent it to fourteen houses - in a widely publicized 1979
        experiment - they all rejected it, including Random House, the pub-
        lisher that brought out the National Book Award-winning novel.

Finnish is a neat language.  (I only know the important words; you

I'm sure you, KRYPTN::MCGOWAN, and others who've been around the block a
few times can correct the correspondent who apparently misunderstood what
Ethel Mertz had in mind when she said that when she and Fred fought, they
were actually making love.  Clearly, Ethel was saying not that she and
Fred were copulating when they fought, but that they were courting and
sparking.  Perhaps one of you older folks (or "landmarked individuals")
can explain when this charming phrase changed meanings.

Ingrid Bergman used the phrase near the beginning of "Spellbound."  Playing
an aloof psychiatrist (this was before Gregory Peck melted her icy reserve),
she responds to the unwelcome advances of a male colleague by saying, in a
cool way, "Are you making love to me?"  I had the pleasure of seeing La
Bergman in "The Inn of the Six Happiness" last weekend;  it was a juicy
role for her.  At one point, her troubles become too oppressive, and she
cries, at which point, I started to cry, too.  I can resist almost anything
except the sight of Bergman crying.  Shame on the moronic American public
for treating her so shoddily during her love affair with Roberto Rosselini.

I don't know when "making love" went naked, but I do know that when

        you or a loved one.

The ad was for an ambulance chaser lawyer.

I've been storing this one up.  Maybe one of the English Desperados
knows more about it.  I heard only the last few sentences of a news
report, but the final quote is one we all wish we had the dignity and
power to enunciate successfully.

Here's the part I heard:  "The balloon was found - peppered with
buckshot - on the estate of Lord Upminster, well-known sportsman and
skeet shooter.  When asked about the incident, Lord Upminster
responded,

        'It would be completely wrong for anyone to say anything.'"
