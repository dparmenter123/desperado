Subj:   Advanced computer technology developed by NASA

    New flight control computers are being introduced on the next space shuttle
 flight.  Built by IBM, the new processors have been under development for
 seven years.

    Increasingly complex applications have strained the memory capacity of the
 current processors, so the new models introduce a major change in memory
 technology:  solid state memory, as opposed to the ferrite core memory used
 to date.  The 64kb chips employed make possible a total memory capacity of
 1 Megabyte of memory, well above the 608 Kilobytes used to date.  The
 engineers have even figured out how to have more than one program loaded into
 memory at a time, so that new code will sometimes not have to be loaded from
 tape every time users switch to a different application.

    Naturally the new technology allows maximum performance increases, and the
 new machines operate at 1.2 Mips, triple the level of the current model.
 Weight of the CPU unit is reduced by nearly half, down to 64 pounds.
 Reliability has been increased by a factor of 4, to slightly above that of an
 entry level home computer, allowing NASA to continue getting by with only 5
 way redundancy.

    The initial run of 40 processors for shuttle installation will cost only
 $1,000,000 apiece (not including development costs).  It is hoped that once
 volume production is achieved, an additional 60 units for ground support will
 be produced at only $500,000 each.  It does not appear that the processor
 will be offered for sale in the civilian workstation market.

    Long Live Spinoff!

    None of this is made up.  It (and worse) is all documented in the 25
 February 1991 Electronic Engineering Times.

Subj:   For Desperado

While I can't say that I particularly think of Desperado as a feminist rag,
the following excerpt from the New Hampshire NOW Newsletter was so
outrageous that I had to share it.  So as my first ever contribution, I
offer you ...

Parker Brothers' New Game "Careers for Girls"

The head of the US Small Business Administration cited Parker Brothers as
showing "insensitivity to modern realities" in a game that lists "supermom"
and schoolteacher as key careers for girls.  SBA Administrator Susan
Engeleiter stated, "Parker Brothers is sending the wrong message to young
girls.  Even Barbie dolls come with business suits these days."

"Careers for Girls" is a new board game targeted for girls ages 8-12.
Players select from six "careers": supermom, schoolteacher, rock star,
fashion designer, college graduate, and animal doctor.  Instructions for
the game, packaged in a hot pink box, include "Show us how you slow dance
with your main squeeze," "Describe your dream husband," "Tell us the names
of your eight children," and "Burn all your chocolate chip cookies."

Parker Brothers' spokesperson Patricia McGovern stressed that the game is
purely for entertainment and "is certainly not to communicate that only
certain careers are limited to women."  The game was designed by a woman,
art was managed by a woman, and the product manager was a woman, she said.

Ironically, "Careers for Girls" is an update of the 1957 version that
listed such professions as big business, prospecting, politics, going to
sea, expedition to the moon, farming, Hollywood, and college.

                              -*-

I just wish someone had told me that "college graduate" was a career.  I
would have quit while I was ahead.

good and less everything bad over here.  As we used to say back in the 60s,

Subj:   true and final transmission from bunker Woolworth's

Each week we stay in the bunker longer. Waiting, ever vigilant. The daily
10-minute bike trip to the commuter van is an unacceptable window of
vulnerability; I'll have to quit work soon. A shame, but bunker preparation
must take priority in these final days.

First it was Woolworth's, which became "Woolworth" about ten years ago. Dates
are vague; I was busy searching for the lost ashes of Enver Hoxha during those
crucial years. The movement combed the Albanian coast for years, to no avail.
Those were still the days of innocent skepticism, before I discovered the
prophetic writings of King Zog's grandson. I merely watched, monitoring the
penetration of Albania from the balcony of my villa in Korfu. We had the best
telescope on the island, and the beach wasn't bad either.

But the movement failed in that attempt, and the conspiracy has flourished
since then. They're planning a channel tunnel from France to England, and
another (a third one!) is going in under Boston harbor. They no longer even
bother to deny the existence of the tunnel between Albania and North Korea.
They've completed a tunnel between Honshu and Hokkaido in Japan since then too.
With government and public approval, no less!

Why not just roll out the red carpet for them and be done with the pretense for
God's sake!

Then it happened to Friendly's, which became the "Friendly" Restaurants.

"Woolworth" and "Friendly" sound ridiculous. What do they gain by forcing us to
use the house name as an adjective, rather than the possessive case of the
noun, which can be used on its own? What was the marketing reason? Or indeed,
was there a marketing reason at all? A chilling thought.

Are Filene's and Jordan's also at risk?  What's next, "Filene"  - the "Jordan"
department store?

Are they trying to sound like Nieman-Marcus, or Bonwit Teller? Maybe it sounds
more posh, more Park Avenue, without the dopey contraction:

"Prepare the Rolls today Jeeves, I'm lunching at the "Wendy" restaurant."

The "Friendly" restaurant chain learned we had caught on, and recently changed
their name BACK to Friendly's again. A pathetic attempt to throw us off the
track, in fact it served as further proof!

But the "posh" argument was a red herring anyway. The real reason for the
insidious name change: the Kim Il Sung, undead Hoxha and undead Art Linkletter
and his recliner chairs for the elderly conspiracy to control America's
collective subconscious, in preparation for global domination.

I confront "Woolworth" and "Friendly" employees at every opportunity, and
demand to know the reason for the subtle name change. It's important to let
them know at least one person knows what they're up to. But of course they
pretend they don't know what I'm talking about. Sure! Brainwashed by Kim Il
Sung I say. Isn't it obvious? Our education system is producing youth world
famous for, even proud of, their ignorance of geography and history. The result
is a nation of pathetic, illiterate, brainwashed dupes, worthless except as
service sector zombies, working at subsistence level. Footsoldiers for the
conspiracy.

On the other hand they were all about 17 years old, maybe they really didn't
know, poor things. They must have thought I was a maniac.

But it's already too late for them, whether they know or not. It doesn't even
matter if they know! They are totally controlled in either case.

Protect your families, I tell my neighbors - build a bunker, make preparations!
Ammo, water, canned artichoke hearts. Destroy all the damned tunnels. They all
think I'm nuts of course. We'll see.

We feel more secure in the bunker; we'll be one of the last to go. And we'll go
fighting! Hoxha's henchmen will never make me believe the lies. We know the
prophecies of Vladu Zog -  we hold the truth!

We have named our bunker Woolworth's, in a final gesture of defiance.

Subj:   re: counting

        &gt;Somebody (not the same body) explained to me that software people
        &gt;count from zero, but hardware people count from one.  That makes so
        &gt;much sense.  If it's not there, it takes software to count it.

        Actually, mathematicians count from 0. I guess in the old days of
        software engineering, many software people were mathematicians.
        The set of counting numbers does start with 1, but that's different
        from the set of integers, which starts with 0. The one
        thing I never did understand was the countable number of
        infinities...

Regarding Aunt Bet hanging out of the truck door (issue # 3043):

I did the same with my wife recently. After visiting the U.S.
Embassy in Copenhagen I proceeded to pull a left hand U-turn on
the wide boulevard in front of the Embassy. Unfortunately, my
wife chose that moment to open her door to retrieve her shoulder
belt, which had been caught in the door. Saab doors are very
HEAVY and this one swung open with a vengance, dragging the wife
along with it. The result was a U-turn accomplished with my wife
extended out of the car, hanging on for dear life to the door
handle. She still thinks to this day that I did it on purpose. I
wonder if she'll live to be 89 years old...

&gt;From "News of the Weird", San Jose Mercury News

        Briton Peter Brimblecombe, a specialist in atmospheric
        chemistry, told reporters in December that two major
        causes of the sulfide that erodes museum photographs
        and paintings were wet woolens (complicated by the fact
        that people often go to galleries on rainy days) and
        bio-effluvients (e.g. flatulence).  His solution?  "If
        people go to galleries and museums, they should wear no
        clothes and control themselves."

    I hate to pick nits, but of the aircraft listed on your "warranty
registration card" only the F15 Eagle is actually made by McDonnell
Douglas. They do make the F18 Hornet and AV8B Harrier which saw
service in the gulf war. The F14 Tomcat is made by Grumman, and the
F16 Falcon is made by General Dynamics. I can't remember if the F19
Stealth was made by Lockheed or someone else, but it wasn't McD.

    Perhaps you've found the missing warranty card for my SCUD
missile?

Subj:   RE: suzette haden elgin - lonesome node

Here's yet another newsletter that might interest you-all... "The
Lonesome Node", published bimonthly by Suzette Haden Elgin.  Elgin is
a linguist, science fiction author ("Native Tongue" et al), somewhat
musician, writer on "Verbal Self Defense" and one woman cottage
industry.  This issue of TLN has articles on "religious language,
language in healthcare, women and language, Ozark English, language
and the brain, linguistics/music interface, verbal self-defense/syntonics,
linguistics for nonlinguists, linguistics/science fiction interface".
She's a crank, and i like her attitude, as well as her taste
(mostly...)

the rest of this consists of extracts from the March/April '91
issue, mostly verbatim:

"What may have happened by the time you read this I cannot even begin
to guess.... I can only say that as I write this in the middle of
February we are in the middle of the worst times I have ever known.
(And I do remember World War II, yes.)  Wars abroad and epidemic
violence at home; a depressions being euphemized as a recession;
ecological catastrophe; educational disaster; plague and drought and
famine and crime and horror and wickedness.  EVERYWHERE.  It's time to
pray, no question about it (or to wish hard, if you don't care for
praying), because this world is in terrible trouble.  It's definitely
time to pray for men and women so adult that, called to go to war,
they will just shake their heads and say, "Sorry. I don't do wars."
Time for the day when a George Bush and a Saddam Hussein and a
Margaret Thatcher, if they MUST draw lines in the sand, will have to
walk personally up to the line and fight each OTHER.  Personally.  One
on one.  I'm willing for them to have bards backing them up while they
Duke It Out, but that's all.  No troops.  No tanks.  No missiles.
Just a bard each."...

"...National Public Radio... on January 16th.  He started out to talk
about "our boys in the Persian Gulf," got a few words into the phrase,
stopped short, and made a hasty repair to "our men and women in the
Persian Gulf".  LOVELY example of semantic contamination.  The problem
is that "girls" are marked irrevocably with a semantic feature like
&lt;+IMMATURE&gt; while "boys" are not.  But when you put them together
as "boys and girls" that feature leaks over to the boys as well,
and the mental image is of kiddies roming in the Persian sands.  Man who
consistently refer to adult women as girls and insist they mean nothing
sexist by it would do well to ponder this example; women who put up with
that would do well to ponder it, too."
...
"For your Ozark English sentence collection: "Would you give me that
card that the back looks like this?" "Whenever his Daddy died, he took
over the farm."  And "That's the one we throw the system away.""
...
"Remember the ad on tv that showed an egg as metaphor for the human
brain and then showed it frying in a pan, with the line "This is your
brain on drugs?"  Good ad, right?  According to FORBES for 2/4/91, drug
users now say to one another, "Let's go fry an egg."  Proving that the
ad is indeed understood and remembered and internalized."
...
excerpt from a piece on "...dreadful Christian hymns.  Like this one:
"God of concrete, God of steel/God of piston and of wheel/God of pylon,
God of stream/God of girder and of beam/God of atom, God or mine:/ all
the world of power is thine."[...] Awful hymns are of course saved
by the fact that they are sung rather than spoken... you can get away
with almost anything if it's set to a decent tune and sung by people
who like to sing."

Subj:   Ed Anger -- mad as hell!!

Ed writes a column, "My America", for the Weekly World News.  Here's
his hard-hitting piece from the April 9 issue;  the first paragraph
alone is the best piece of work I've seen in ages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EGGHEADS BLOW $12 MILLION TRYING TO TALK TO EXTRATERRESTRIALS
 ... and taxpayers are footing the bill

I'm madder than E.T. with a bag of melted Reese's Pieces that our
free-spending Congress is paying 12 million bucks of heard-earned tax
money on a project to contact space aliens! Let's face it! Why the
hell are we spending big bucks looking for space aliens when they land
here all the time for free?

All the eggheads at NASA"s Ames Research Center in California have to
do is look out the window on a clear night and they'd see more UFOs
than you could shake a stick at!

But nooooooooooo!

Dr. Jill Tarter is the scientific queenpin behind this stupid Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project that gets under way in
October and is expected to cost a whopping $100 million over the next
10 years.

But what makes me so pig-biting mad is why aim all these high-tech
electronic listening devices at stars where only dimwit aliens live?

That's right, folks.  Stupid aliens.  If they were smart, they would
have already contacted US, wouldn't they?  Or buzzed us in one of
those UFOs people see all the time.

The bottom line is that smart aliens are already here and the only
ones we'll contact by radio waves are so dumb they'll never answer us
anyway.

In fact, even if we did make contact with these half-cockroach,
half-fish civilizations, what the hell are we going to learn from 'em
-- how to live under rocks?  Why the hell don't WE get smart and try
to learn everything we can about the space creatures who are already
here, for Pete's sake?

Those are the light-bulb heads we have to worry about.  I've said it
before and I'll say it again, the only good space alien is a dead
space alien.

If these suckers are so damn friendly, why th hell haven't they gone
public?

Most of 'em are evil and want to colonize the Earth and make humans
into slaves, that's why.

So I've got a better idea about how to spend 12 million bucks of our
tax money -- let's spend it on alien traps.  We could bait 'em with
whatever these bug-eyed reptiles ear and end this alien threat to
Earth once and for all!

&gt;&gt; in operating systems."  Thompson apologized.

The professor exaggerates - but not by much. The comments by Bob in .29

comp.society.futures about windowing systems, and an interesting article
(included below) on OS developement (included below) landed in my

The problem with OSF/Motif - and X in general - is not that it's missing

that the resource mechanism can be deleted from it in any reasonable way.

2.1    THE RISE OF ``WORSE IS BETTER''

I and just about every designer of Common Lisp and CLOS has had extreme
exposure to the MIT/Stanford style of design. The essence of this style can be
captured by the phrase ``the right thing.'' To such a designer it is important
to get all of the following characteristics right:

  + Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and
    interface. It is more important for the interface to be simple than the
    implementation.

  + Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects.
    Incorrectness is simply not allowed.

  + Consistency -- the design must not be inconsistent. A design is allowed to
    be slightly less simple and less complete to avoid inconsistency.
    Consistency is as important as correctness.

  + Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is
    practical. All reasonably expected cases must be covered. Simplicity is
    not allowed to overly reduce completeness.

I believe most people would agree that these are good characteristics.  I will
call the use of this philosophy of design the ``MIT approach.''  Common Lisp
(with CLOS) and Scheme represent the MIT approach to design and
implementation.

The worse-is-better philosophy is only slightly different:

  + Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and
    interface.  It is more important for the implementation to be simple than
    the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.

  + Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects. It is
    slightly better to be simple than correct.

  + Consistency -- the design must not be overly inconsistent.  Consistency can
    be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those
    parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to
    introduce either implementational complexity or inconsistency.

  + Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is
    practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered.  Completeness
    can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. In fact, completeness
    must sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized.
    Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is
    retained; especially worthless is consistency of interface.

Early Unix and C are examples of the use of this school of design, and I will
call the use of this design strategy the ``New Jersey approach.'' I have
intentionally caricatured the worse-is-better philosophy to convince you that
it is obviously a bad philosophy and that the New Jersey approach is a bad
approach.

However, I believe that worse-is-better, even in its strawman form, has better
survival characteristics than the-right-thing, and that the New Jersey
approach when used for software is a better approach than the MIT approach.

Let me start out by retelling a story that shows that the MIT/New-Jersey
distinction is valid and that proponents of each philosophy actually believe
their philosophy is better.

Two famous people, one from MIT and another from Berkeley (but working on
Unix) once met to discuss operating system issues. The person from MIT was
knowledgeable about ITS (the MIT AI Lab operating system) and had been reading
the Unix sources. He was interested in how Unix solved the PC loser-ing
problem. The PC loser-ing problem occurs when a user program invokes a system
routine to perform a lengthy operation that might have significant state, such
as IO buffers. If an interrupt occurs during the operation, the state of the
user program must be saved. Because the invocation of the system routine is
usually a single instruction, the PC of the user program does not adequately
capture the state of the process. The system routine must either back out or
press forward. The right thing is to back out and restore the user program PC
to the instruction that invoked the system routine so that resumption of the
user program after the interrupt, for example, re-enters the system routine.
It is called ``PC loser-ing'' because the PC is being coerced into ``loser
mode,'' where ``loser'' is the affectionate name for ``user'' at MIT.

The MIT guy did not see any code that handled this case and asked the New
Jersey guy how the problem was handled. The New Jersey guy said that the Unix
folks were aware of the problem, but the solution was for the system routine
to always finish, but sometimes an error code would be returned that signaled
that the system routine had failed to complete its action. A correct user
program, then, had to check the error code to determine whether to simply try
the system routine again. The MIT guy did not like this solution because it
was not the right thing.

The New Jersey guy said that the Unix solution was right because the design
philosophy of Unix was simplicity and that the right thing was too complex.
Besides, programmers could easily insert this extra test and loop. The MIT guy
pointed out that the implementation was simple but the interface to the
functionality was complex. The New Jersey guy said that the right tradeoff has
been selected in Unix -- namely, implementation simplicity was more important
than interface simplicity.

The MIT guy then muttered that sometimes it takes a tough man to make a tender
chicken, but the New Jersey guy didn't understand (I'm not sure I do either).

Now I want to argue that worse-is-better is better. C is a programming
language designed for writing Unix, and it was designed using the New Jersey
approach. C is therefore a language for which it is easy to write a decent
compiler, and it requires the programmer to write text that is easy for the
compiler to interpret. Some have called C a fancy assembly language. Both
early Unix and C compilers had simple structures, are easy to port, require
few machine resources to run, and provide about 50%-80% of what you want from
an operating system and programming language.

Half the computers that exist at any point are worse than median (smaller or
slower). Unix and C work fine on them.  The worse-is-better philosophy means
that implementation simplicity has highest priority, which means Unix and C
are easy to port on such machines.  Therefore, one expects that if the 50%
functionality Unix and C support is satisfactory, they will start to appear
everywhere.  And they have, haven't they?

Unix and C are the ultimate computer viruses.

A further benefit of the worse-is-better philosophy is that the programmer is
conditioned to sacrifice some safety, convenience, and hassle to get good
performance and modest resource use. Programs written using the New Jersey
approach will work well both in small machines and large ones, and the code
will be portable because it is written on top of a virus.

It is important to remember that the initial virus has to be basically good.
If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is portable.  Once the virus
has spread, there will be pressure to improve it, possibly by increasing its
functionality closer to 90%, but users have already been conditioned to accept
worse than the right thing.  Therefore, the worse-is-better software first
will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and
third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing.  In concrete
terms, even though Lisp compilers in 1987 were about as good as C compilers,
there are many more compiler experts who want to make C compilers better than
want to make Lisp compilers better.

The good news is that in 1995 we will have a good operating system and
programming language; the bad news is that they will be Unix and C++.

There is a final benefit to worse-is-better. Because a New Jersey language and
system are not really powerful enough to build complex monolithic software,
large systems must be designed to reuse components. Therefore, a tradition of
integration springs up.

How does the right thing stack up? There are two basic scenarios: the ``big
complex system scenario'' and the ``diamond-like jewel'' scenario.

The ``big complex system'' scenario goes like this:

First, the right thing needs to be designed. Then its implementation needs to
be designed. Finally it is implemented. Because it is the right thing, it has
nearly 100% of desired functionality, and implementation simplicity was never
a concern so it takes a long time to implement. It is large and complex.  It
requires complex tools to use properly. The last 20% takes 80% of the
effort, and so the right thing takes a long time to get out, and it only runs
satisfactorily on the most sophisticated hardware.

The ``diamond-like jewel'' scenario goes like this:

The right thing takes forever to design, but it is quite small at
every point along the way. To implement it to run fast is either
impossible or beyond the capabilities of most implementors.

The two scenarios correspond to Common Lisp and Scheme.

The first scenario is also the scenario for classic artificial intelligence
software.

The right thing is frequently a monolithic piece of software, but for no
reason other than that the right thing is often designed monolithically.
That is, this characteristic is a happenstance.

The lesson to be learned from this is that it is often undesirable to go for
the right thing first. It is better to get half of the right thing available
so that it spreads like a virus. Once people are hooked on it, take the time
to improve it to 90% of the right thing.

A wrong lesson is to take the parable literally and to conclude that C is the
right vehicle for AI software. The 50% solution has to be basically right, and
in this case it isn't.

But, one can conclude only that the Lisp community needs to seriously rethink
its position on Lisp design.  I will say more about this later.

I feel I have some right to comment on this story, since I was the
"MIT guy" and Bill Joy was the "New Jersey guy".  (Bill Joy was at
Berkeley at the time, and what they're calling the "New Jersey
philosophy" does characterize the philosophy at Berkeley at the time.)
I've told this story a few times, to illustrate this philosophical
difference, and the writer got the story basically right.

I think this essay draws the wrong conclusions about why Unix and C
have become prevelant.  It's not primarily because of this
philosophical difference.  The real reasons lie elsewhere; I won't
try to go into that here.

If Unix had done the PCLSR thing correctly, it would not have made
Unix any more difficult to port.  The amount of code necessary would
not suddenly make Unix only capable of running on large machines.  The
code requires a lot of care, but not much in the way of extra
instructions.

Subj:   Unix

My previous mail caused several people to ask me to what I *do*
attribute the spread of Unix.  This is just off the top of my head and
does not reflect any careful or quantiative analysis, but rather my
accumulated impressions.  I'd attribute the spread of Unix to the
confluence of the following somewhat interrelated factors:

(1) Unix existed as a reasonably portable operating system, just at
the point when the market of computer-buyers became very interested in
being able to switch hardware vendors while running the same software.
As soon as buyers perceived that a portable operating system meant
that they would not have to be locked into a particular vendor, they
jumped at the chance, since it gave them important new leverage over
hardware vendors.  They could now plausibly threaten to switch
vendors, because their in software dislocation would be so much less.
Unix didn't have any competition; to the extent that there was a
demand for a portable operating system, Unix was really the only
choice.

(2) There was a sudden and rapid growth of the new "workstation"
category, and particularly the rapid rise of Sun Microsystems (which
strongly pushed Unix), as well as the availability of high-end PCs
that could run versions of Unix.

(3) These phenomena built upon themselves, i.e. there was a
positive-feedback effect.  As more companies climbed on the Unix
bandwagon, and perceived that others were likely to do so, there was
increased pressure to adopt Unix.  Furthermore, a large body of
software came into existence for the Unix platforms, because it is
less difficult to port between Unix platforms than between unrelated
platforms.  As more software exists, the platforms become more
valuable and sell more, thus creating more incentive for developers to
provide more software for the platforms, etc.

I don't think that Unix particularly benefited from inelegance,
toleration of bugs, and so on.  Rather, I don't think these factors,
or the differences between the two philosophies, were important enough
to stand in the way of much stronger forces that pushed Unix forward.
Sadly for the egos of engineers, much of what we hold dear does not
have critical market impact, because it's drowned out by factors that
are more important to customers.

Your analysis only discusses the phase of Unix/C takeover in which
companies commited to it. Your argument has the form: there was a
cliff that needed a car to fall off it, and the car that was right
there at the top was the one that fell off.

The questions I was trying to answer were why was *that* car there,
and where did that cliff come from?

Unix/C has been around for about 2 decades, and the effects you are
talking about occurred roughly within the last 6 years. Certainly part
of the reason the car was there was because Unix/C had already spread,
perhaps as a virus. (Sussman claims that Unix/C spread as a symbiot on
the virus of PDP-11's, but that doesn't seem to me to address the
central question - PDP-11's had their own OS's). By 1983 there was
already one or two generations of Unix weenies in existence, infected
with the Unix/C virus. So when the cliff appeared, they had the car
ready.

The cliff got there at least partly because there was a means to claim
a new concept in computing - open. To consumers this implies a reduced
risk, but the concept of open merely means a portable OS. Where could
this concept have arisen? From an already existing portable OS. Who
could have come up with the concept? A smart entrepeneur who noticed
that Unix was already everywhere in a variety of universities and
labs, whose Unix/C-infected graduates and refugees where now senior
decision makers at potential customer companies.

So the key ideas are that Unix/C had already spread for almost 15
years, and the several generations of Unix/C weenies had moved high
enough up the ladder, so that the infected were making decisions -
recall your movie history and remember ``Invasion of the Body
Snatchers.''

This is the reasoning behind Sussman and Abelson's Scheme plan - to
teach/infect several generations of to-be-influential people with the
Scheme virus. I note that there is no necessary reason for a Worse is
Better artifact to be as bad as it has in the past, so it is not
contradictory that Scheme might one day be the Worse is Better
solution.  Scheme is a very conservative, intellectually 30-year-old
language.  When it takes over, it will be the Worse is Better
alternative.

I note with sadness that no car designed by us - the Right Thing crowd
- could have appeared at the top of cliff, and we certainly did not
create any cliffs.

So, your analysis is a good one for the tail end of the disaster,
explaining what happened starting at the point when the 10-mile-wide
comet has 10 feet above Manhattan and ending with the black cloud
circling the earth, dropping temperatures 20 degrees.

Subj:   Re: Unix

Folks:

I can hate Unix with the best of them. However, I have the cheerful
thought that all this flaming is on the verge of becoming obsolete.

SunOS 4.1.1, or V.4, or even AIX 3.1, for all their manifest faults,
are a damn sight closer to "right things" than V6 or 4.2.  There
appears to be a community of Unix developers-by-neccessity who don't
share the Berkeley chewing gum and bailing wire ethic, and are
steadily turning it into a real system. V.4 shared libraries are just
about ok. So are its mapped files. The korn shell is acceptable.  ANSI
C is still an ideal weapon for shooting oneself in the foot, but the
trigger is a little stiffer.

To my great amusement, the traditional Unix weenies piss and moan on
the net at great length about the good old days when Unix was small
and had no features (and no reliability, ... .. ...). These messages
are the symptoms of

  "Revenge of the OS Weenies"

in which the folks who brought us Multics, (and, on the other hand,
S/360), are Tunneling From Within.

When Sun popped up on the map, what were the choices?

The vendor-supported OS's were awful, in most cases. For a PDP 11, RSX
or RT. I'd take V7 over any of them in a lot of cases. For a PDP 10,
TOPS 10 (ha). Tenex from some obscure communications company. For a
VAX, VMS version 1. Multics required insanely expensive gear. We won't
talk about IBM stuff. Lisp Machines? Far too expensive per seat in
those days.  So if you wanted to do coursework or engineering, you
might well see Unix as the superior alternative.

In other words, from the perspective of those of us who worked on
wonderful system with narrow availability, Unix was Worse. From
the point of view of the masses, Unix may well have been Better even
in the areas where we find it most wanting. If "we" had gone and
designed a wonderful system that ran on PDP11's, and seeded the
Universities with it, what would we have to flame about?

No harm in running the Simpsons again, is there?

        The reason the All-Unix issue was delayed so long, and therefore the
        reason for the current log jam of Desperadoes, was that just after I
        finished compiling the All-Unix issue a month ago a massive
        floor-wide VMS crash swept it away and it's taken me until now to
        build my spirits back up.

        We've just completed the longest and loveliest spring of all the
        time I've lived in New England.  I've taken myself off duty and am
        now on vacation, digging in my garden and waiting out an addition to
        the family, so I sat down to clear out the pre-archives a little
        bit.

        You should see at least a couple of more Desperadoes in the next few
        days.  I assume John will space them out.

        Best regards,
        yr. bdy,
        Tom Parmenter
