Subj:   Ice cream calories don't *really* count

&gt; Desperadi in eastern Mass. and southern N.H. will be pleased to learn
&gt; that Kimball Farms opened for the season last weekend.  I stopped in
&gt; yesterday, and I'm happy to report that their ice cream (made on the
&gt; premises) is still very tasty, and their servings are still generous
&gt; and inexpensive.  No, fresh fruit sundaes are NOT in season yet.
&gt;
&gt; Kimball's is on Rte. 110 in Westford, MA.  Just look for the traffic
&gt; jam on any warm day.

[Take exit 31 off of Rt. 495, head toward Littleton Center, turn left
at Rte 110, look on the right]

Right ON!  Just about the best ice cream in the entire known universe!
(Steve who???)

Their special for the month(?) is Almond Joy.  Just what you'd expect
-- coconut ice cream with almonds and chocolate chips mixed in.
Better hurry tho' - they sell it faster than they can make it.

Best part, after the flavor, of course,  is the price - $.90 buys a
"small" cone/cup, which is about 2 overfull giagantomorous scoops.
$1.10 for a "large", but I didn't have to courage for that!  A hand
packed pint, which is, the way they pack it, more like 1.25*pint, is
$1.80 - heck, I've paid that much for a dish at some anonymous places
with the initials HJ.

Disclaimer:  In the best Usenet tradition, this is where I swear upon
my  DCL Dictionary that I am not associated with the aforementioned
Kimball's except as a immensely satisfied customer.

Eat your hearts out, VOGON'ers!

Subj:   Kimballs?  Bah, humbug!

Kimball's in Westford gives a lot of ice cream.  Their sundaes are big.
Their cones are big.  They are next to a meadow (as are all ice cream
stands worth their rock salt).  They do a lot of business.  The fruit on
their fresh-fruit-sundaes is fresh.  Their ice cream is better than
store-brand ice cream.  And you get a lot of it.

Kimball's is NOT the best ice cream stand in New England.  In fact, they
aren't even the best ice cream stand in the greater Maynard area.

Don't get me wrong... If it's a nice day outside, I'm the first out the
door if someone suggests Kimballs at around 2:30 or so.  But, gee whiz!

When I was in college, one of my friends and his girl friend went on an ice
cream stand hunt almost every night for most of the summer.  If it was
within a few hours of Lowell, they found it.  As I remember, he placed
Kimball's somewhere around 10th.  A few years ago, he and his wife went to
re-visit the stand he thought was the best (somewhere around Kittery or York,
Maine).  There were practically tears in his eyes as he told me the stand
had been torn down and was now a tacky housing development.

May I suggest Desperadi in southern New Hampshire and northeastern Mass
visit Burbeck's in Lowell.  They're across the street from the Merrimack
River next to two nice waterfront parks.  They give almost the same amount
of ice cream as Kimball's (ie: about enough to feed a family of eight),
but it's creamier and better tasting.

Directions:

        From around 495, take the Lowell Connector (Exit 36 from 495) to
        Thorndike Street (Exit 5N).  Follow Thorndike Street for about two
        miles, then take a left at the end of the street (there's a Gulf
        station at the corner). Follow Pawtucket Street about a mile or so.
        Burbeck's will be on your left, a couple of blocks after the set of
        lights. (If not rush hour, it's about 10 minutes from 495.  DO NOT
        TRY THIS DURING RUSH HOUR, 4:00-6:30!!!)

        From Nashua, take Route 3 to the Drum Hill rotary (Rte 4, exit 32?).
        Follow the rotary around a few times until you catch the street that
        Caldor is on (Drum Hill Road/Westford Street).  About a mile or so
        down the road, bear left at the fork (Wood Street).  At the end of
        Wood Street (after OSCO) turn right (Middlesex Street).  Bear left
        at the set of lights (Pawtucket Street).  Follow the river and
        Burbeck's will be on your right, just past ULowell South Campus.
        (Maybe 20 minutes or so from Spit Brook).

Burbeck's also has a small ice cream parlor (complete with tall stools and a
marble counter) in downtown Lowell on Merrimack Street, diagonally across
Dutton Street from City Hall.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
My contribution to the ice cream tempest is only that my lifelong favorite
from the age of about four on has been and probably always will be Howard
Johnson's Butter Pecan. Say what you will about HoJo's, and who doesn't,
those guys understand Butter Pecan ice cream. Also Swiss Chocolate Almond.
But I buy the child-sized cone when I can. Austere but not ascetic, that's
me...

month or so ago.  Each of the cards featured a different book concerned
with computer science, electrical engineering, or management/business.

One book was called something like "How to Become a Vice-President in

&gt; From: BOOKIE::WEAVER       "That record contains things that cannot be
&gt;                                expressed in the DATATRIEVE language."

The quote, of course, refers to Godel (with an umlaut-o)'s
Incompleteness Theorem which says, loosely speaking, that in any number
system that contains enough information to describe the ordinary
natural numbers, there will be some unproveably true statements.

I'm not enough of a mathematician to go into great detail about the
theory here, but I am very interested in it.  Every so often an
article related to it appears in Scientific American, including ones
that I remember about infinity and about random numbers.

Anyway, what I really wanted to say about the theorem is related to
something I remember hearing a long time ago, maybe on a PBS show
(they would talk about this sort of thing).  It concerned a discussion
by some art critic about the impact of the introduction of the
Uncertainty Principle on the art world of the 1930's.  It was his
opinion that when the idea that some things could never be known for
certain was grasped by artists, that it freed their imaginations from
a realistic style to a more surrealistic one, since "who can know what
Reality is, anyway?"

What then stuck in my mind was that, if the Uncertainty Principle
could have such impact on art, how much more so should such a more
far-reaching and mind-boggling (from a philosophical point of view)
concept at the Incompleteness Theorem.  After all, Uncertainty is
&gt;still&lt; just a postulate; Godel &gt;proved&lt; Incompleteness!  Perhaps the
theorem has not yet been "popularized" enough to be understood outside
of mathematics.

Oh well, just my musings on a Saturday afternoon.  Perhaps your other
gentle readers would like to take up the discussion.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Shouldn't at all be surprised if the PBS show you remember wasn't the
splendid _Shock of the New_ with Robert Hughes, a clear-eyed, razor-tongued
critic and historian who did a thirteen-part series on modern art, which
I venture to say will never be the same. What that man can do to a
pretension is equal only to what he can illicit in the way of perception.

Subj:   The B&amp;B Unicorns

The actual story behind the Unicorns was revealed several weeks ago.  Several
veterinarians examined the unicorns and determined that they were simply
normal billy goats with surgically replanted horns.   The vets said that
the surgery did not harm the animals and therefore they did not consider this
inhumane treatment.

It was later revealed that there is a couple somewhere that now runs a
business providing such "unicorns".

Subj:   Lancelot the unicorn - the untold story

For all the Desperados who are curious, here it is, the truth about Lancelot,
the unicorn-troversial Ringling Brothers star attraction.  I saw this
information in a magazine, with photographs, some years ago; I don't recall
which one it was.

Lancelot and his einhorn kin, of whom there are quite a few scattered about
but not highly publicised, are not bred with a single horn.  Neither are they
the result of any weird kind of transplant.  They are, however, the result of
medical experimentation.

A close examination of the horn will give away the secret - running the length
of the horn's centre there is a faint sort of line, which is the result of the
method used to create the horn:  The two normal horn buds of a newborn animal
are surgically moved together and fused into one.  The horn can't grow in a
normal curve because the two halves of its bud are oriented so that they want
to curve in opposite directions, and they cancel each other's curves.

The procedure is no more painful or inhumane than castration or the docking of
a dog's tail; once the surgical trauma is healed, there is no discomfort to
the animal.

There have been unicorns made from goats and cattle; and the finding is that
unicorns have a significant advantage when it comes to fighting for a mate.

For obvious reasons of showmanship and money, the circus is reluctant to
reveal the very mundane truth of Lancelot's magical horn.

Medieval tapestries depict unicorns as goats.  Beards, cloven hooves,
and goat shapes are clearly seen in tapestries.  The resemblance to
horses is a modern development, dating from the Romantic era.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Between the elegant heraldically thin goat-unicorn of the Cluny tapestries

HIGH-TECH EAVESDROPPING.  The four techies spent almost the entire

asked the others eagerly.  "None, it's a hardware problem."  They fell
into hysterics.  It took us computer neophytes a while day to figure

In Desperado issue #1112, the section on "Lite (r) Books" should have
mentioned that the original cartoon to which the text belongs was
published in "The New Yorker" by Roz Chast.   Chast is a very
peculiar cartoonist whose humor seems to come from another planet,
but if you can appreciate the humor, her cartoons are very funny.
Next time any of you Desperadoes are in a bookstore, look for
a collection of her cartoons called "Parallel Universes."
If you appreciate "The Velcros At Home" and "Lots O' Ducks", you're
my kind of person.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Quite right, and I don't believe I didn't pick up on that...I'm usually quick
off the mark when it comes to asssigning credit where credit is due. For many
years I thought Roz Chast was too bizarre for words, but slowly  she has
crept into my good books, where, for example, Gerry Larson has always been.

So you like Winston Churchill stories?

Here's one, but I forget where it came from.

W.C. was visiting the U.S. one summer and, by chance, attended a cookout
in Newburyport.  His hostess was hovering over him, offering him
a selection of tasty barbecued chicken, and she asked him his preference
in chicken parts.

"I will have a chicken breast.",W.C. responded.

The hostess pointed out to W.C. that in America we refer to them
as 'white meat'.

Upon returning to England, W.C. sent his gracious hostess a corsage
with a note saying," Thank you for a lovely time.  This is for
you to wear on your white meat."
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I'd believe that story of a lot of visiting Englishmen, but not Churchill
somehow. And one slight correction -- I'm not the one who likes Winston
Churchill stories. YOU are the ones who like Winston Churchill stories, I
assume, since you keep sending them to me week after week.

I like Johannes Brahms stories, but I only know one, and it makes me cry.
Somebody was going to visit Brahms at his summer house and sit at his feet
so to speak. The visitor arrived at the railroad station on a beautiful summer
evening and walked up through the little town, with the air smelling sweetly
and the evening full of birdsong. He reached Brahms' little house and
couldn't rouse anybody by his knocking, so he walked around to the back of
the house where Brahms had a studio, with large windows. And the visitor
looked in the window, and  there was Brahms, sitting at a big table covered
with music paper, and weeping as if his heart would break.

That and the third act of La Boheme send me racing for the Kleenex.

Subj:   User Review of AT&amp;T Unix-PC

Organization: Math &amp; Computer Science, Emory University, Atlanta

I have had a chance to use an AT&amp;T UNIX PC for the last three days.
The version we have has 1MB ram and a 10MB hard disk, Microsoft Word
and Multiplan, and a business graphics pckage.  We have used it as
a vt100 terminal to our Vax 780 running 4.2 and have connected a
second terminal and run it multi user.  We did not get a chance to
use the phone manager and internal modem.

My overall feeling is that this is a very nice UNIX (tm) box.  As a two
user system it has very acceptable performance, with little degradation
even when one user is doing several fscks in the background.  It does
seem to be doing a lot of swapping to disk, even when a single user is
running a small task, but this may be related to how it handles disk I/O
(see the BYTE article for details).  I am not particularly thrilled with
Sys V after running in a 4.2 environment, but I think a lot of the problems
will disappear when ksh becomes available.

The ua (user agent) shell is a decent attempt at a windowing environment,
but comes up short in many ways when compared to the Macintosh.
The foremost difference between the two is that the Mac screens just
look crisper and more precise.  AT&amp;T uses wide highlighted borders
which end up making the screen hard on the eyes.  AT&amp;T makes no use of
icons to speak of so the two desktops are not really comparable.
The AT&amp;T windows have size, drag, kill, scroll, and help boxes.  The
scroll boxes give no indication if more info is beyond the border.  This
is a particular problem on the UNIX PC because the system will only size
windows on natural breaks.  If you size a window so that it cuts through
the middle of a field the system will resize the window so that there is
a border around the text, making it appear as if you are seeing everything
in that window.

The drag and size boxes have a lag between when you click on them and
when they become active.  When active the arrow cursor changes to a small
w in a box.  You can move this at high speed and the drag or size box will
always end up wherever you leave the w box (window box?).  If you don't
wait for the cursor to change before you start dragging then the actual
cursor location will differ from where the system thinks it is by how
far you got the cursor away from the drag box before it changed to a
w box.  When  you have located a new position or size it takes about
two seconds on an unloaded system before the new window is built.
This seems very slow in comparison to a 128k Mac.

On the plus side, this is a multitasking environment so something useful
can be going on in those windows and it is extremely easy to jump
from one to another.  You can have as many as 9 open windows (the
system has 12 windows in dev, but seems to say 'can't open window
when you get to 9 of yours on the screen') and you can jump back and
forth in an instant.  If you are using the UNIX PC as a terminal
(as I am now) you get the full screen, but can immediately get to any
of the other open windows behind it by clicking on the 'W' icon in
the screen's upper right corner.  This gives you a list of all active
windows.  As long as any small piece of a window remains on the screen
you can get back to that window by clicking on it.  Very fast and very
nice.  At first you don't find this feature too useful because you have
no experience with that kind of jumping between tasks, but it becomes
addicting quickly.  I suspect I would usually set up several commonly
used tasks in windows and not do a lot of dragging and sizing during a
session, but just jump between them.

The AT&amp;T mouse is very nice.  It has a much more precise feel than the
Mac mouse and the three buttons are useful.  The left button is the
enter button, the middle shows the command menu, or a specialized command
menu in specific applications, the right button is a mark/select button
and does different things in different aplications (generally it allows
you to scroll through options or to mark sections in a text or a spread
sheet).  The mouse is very responsive and it is very easy to precisely
control the cursor's screen position.

The keyboard is a mixed blessing.  It has a very nice feel, although it
may be too sensitive for some people's tastes.  The only real booboo is
that there is a big fat Caps Lock key about where one might expect to
find the control key. The control key(s) are on either side of the
space bar.  Everything else is nicely laid out.  It does have lots
of special function keys, but you don't have to use them since they
are all available from onscreen menus.  However as one gets more
experience they make it very easy to skip screen menus and get the job
done.  There are 8 oversize function keys at the top of the keyboard
which change function within an application.  They can either be
activated with the mouse or used as keys.  Their function is displayed
in large lighted boxes at the screen bottom.

My main gripes with the system are that is only comes with a green screen
(if you like green screens you'll love this one, but I hate them) and
I had hope for more from the windowing shell.  On the other hand AT&amp;T
has really put together a very powerful package.  I think it will let
you do about anything you want and it does most of them very well.
The disk does whistle, but is fast and you get an overall feeling that
there are a lot of available resources.  The VT100 emulation is good
and hooking to another computer or adding a terminal is very simple.

My overall feeling about this machine is that if AT&amp;T listens to customer
response and cleans up the windows this should be a really great machine
with the next software release.  In the mean time I'm trying to come
up with the money (our price is $3,700 for a 1MB RAM, 20MB disk package)
to get one now.  There isn't a PC that can hold a candle to it as a
single-user, multitasking machine for the money.  Let's hope AT&amp;T can
get the rest of the package worked out, they have made a very good start.

SUBJECT: AT&amp;T'S MICROPROCESSOR CHIP

I've had folks get data sheets and look carefully at the latest AT&amp;T
microprocessor chip.  Basically, our conclusion is that it should
perform at approximately the same performance as MicroVax II.  What
AT&amp;T has done is to essentially copy the VAX architecture (just like
National Semiconductor did) with a few slight modifications.  We've
looked at the potential areas of patent conflict and they have avoided
them, unfortunately.  In addition, they have made a few enhancements
to the chip to make it run Unix better.  This probably means that this
is a better Unix engine than the MicroVax II.

AT&amp;T has used a 2 micron double level metal CMOS process.  Basically,
this process should be a higher performance process than any we've
used for MicroVax II, and is really the process technology we're
planning to use for the CVAX chip.  We estimate that CVAX will be in
the 2.5 to the 3.0 mip range.  The reason that the AT&amp;T chip isn't of
a much higher performance level is that they have basically screwed up
the partitioning and used an inferior (from a standpoint of
performance) set of design tools.  Their chip is over four tenths of
an inch on a side (MicroVax is .35 inches on a side) despite the fact
that they are using a much denser process.  They have included on chip
a CACHE, but left the memory management off chip.  In addition, they
have used their cell design systems to build the chip and have
fundamentally ended up with much lower performance circuits.
Apparently, in the design process, they partitioned the work out very
narrowly to their people and do not have folks who understand the
architecture all the way down to the silicon.  We have ascertained
this by interviewing a large percentage of the design team that did
the chip.  Essentially, they have some folks who design the functional
level of the chip, specifying the box. They have others who design the
detailed logic with no real understanding of the overall function nor
of the actual implementation of the gates and silicon.   Lastly, they
partitioned the work such that the circuit designers just implemented
the logic they were given.  Without this higher order of integration
and understanding, they ended up with a very inefficient structure.
It's a good thing for us, or they would have had a very, very high
performance chip.  As it is, it is probably highly competitive to the
MicroVax.  However, it is unlikely that they are going to make a lot
of them in the near future with the die sizes they are using.
