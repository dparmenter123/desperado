              REAL PROGRAMMERS PROGRAM IN REAL TIME

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Here in RSXland, we think real-time programming is the only stuff
there is and everything else might as well be written in interpreted
BASIC.  I assume most of you saw the original, much-forwarded version
of this.  I took out a lot of stuff I either didn't understand or
agree with, or that didn't apply here and added a few more.  At any
rate, here, heavily edited, is some stuff about how to tell real
programmers.

Old joke:  You can always tell a real programmer, but you can't tell
them much.

Who says real programmers don't eat from vending machines?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Real programmers never finish their programs, but they can always
finish them in a couple of days from "now".  Real programmers put
dirty words in their labels.  Real programmers work for computer
companies.  Real programmers don't write applications.  Real
programmers don't write microcode either. Real programmers don't use
flow charts.  Real programmers don't write specs.  Real programmers
don't comment their code.  Real programmers write readable code, which
they refuse to explain. Real programmers don't play video games; they
write them. Real programmers reboot the system and analyze the crash
dump whenever it goes down. Real programmers have read the standards
manual, but won't admit it. Real programmers don't dress for success
unless they are trying to convince others that they are going on
interviews. Real programmers don't know what systems analysts do, but
they know they could do it better.  Real programmers drink too much
coffee so that they will always seem tense   and overworked. Real
programmers always have a better idea. Real programmers can do
anything in half a day or eight lines of code, whichever is quicker.
Real programmers can do octal, hexadecimal and binary math in their
heads. Real programmers don't write memos.  Real programmers don't
know anything about business. Real programmers can't spell quiche.
Real programmers write their own sorts. Real programmers think an
eight-hour day is for sissies. Real programmers loathe documentation.
Real programmers wouldn't use the word "loathe".  Real programmers are
single.  Real programmers don't do maintenance. Real programmers eat
any damn thing, including cold pizza.  Real programmers roll up their
shirt sleeves. Real programmers don't drink decaffeinated coffee. Real
programmers never refuse a drink. Real programmers smoke. Real
programmers read science fiction, only science fiction.  Real
programmers drive Volkswagen Beetles. Real programmers make lousy
managers. Real programmers started as operators, in high school.  Real
programmers don't work for banks or insurance companies more than a
year. Real programmers don't work for city, state or federal
governments at all. Real programmers code in their heads.  Real
programmers debug in their heads, but they like piles of listings
around anyway.  Real programmers can always find one more bug.

I moved to a bright, shiny new condo a few months ago, so I got to spend
a lot of time in department stores looking for things to take up the
empty space I just bought.  Boy, was I impressed at how Hi-Tech appliance
departments have become!

Virtually every appliance can be bought with a keyboard and a micro in it.

I can almost understand programming a washing machine.  programming a
counter-top convection oven is a bit bizarre.  But a programmable food
mixer?

Maybe I'm just lazy, but it seems to be a lot more work to program a
food mixed to run at medium speed (via a touch-panel keyboard) than it
is to just put the switch to "medium".

If people will buy programmable coffee-makers, washers, dryers, dishwashers,
food mixers, blenders, convection ovens, uwave ovens, food processors, and
at least a dozen other items, why not put a VAX in a refrigerator!  Talk
about opening new markets!

A lot of neat puns come to mind...
        [ie:  The refrigerator breaks down... Don't kick it... Boot it!]

There are plenty of useful applications for the MicroVAX in
robots, automobile fuel injection, smart workstations, etc.
Just because it would be useless in a refrigerator doesn't
mean the only thing it's useful for is military application.

As a Massachusetts native, I can attest that 128 is frequently
used as a generic term for beltway. Hence, 495 is a 128.

Sorry, folks, DIGITAL once again is a little late.  Smart refrigerators
already exist.  They have little tiny microprocessors that can smell the
aging leftovers and report to you, in tiny mechanical voices, that you
have rotting mashed potatoes on the bottom shelf.  They even have been
known to shriek in panic when a guest starts to open the door of a
particularly rancid refrigerator.

Westinghouse sells these little gems for around $800.  I haven't
bought one.  Yet.

Here is what I think a VAX-powered refrigerator should do:

In response to my preset verbal command -- such as, "Yo, brewski" -- the
refrigerator would trundle itself over to the couch, reach into its
compartment for a cold one, stick the bottle in its ear to remove the cap,
and hand me the beer.  A pretzel-dispenser option would be nice, too.

To:     BRADLEY
Subj:   Bells and Whistles

        I happened to see in some of your mail the other day
a discussion of the putative origins of the phrase "bells and whistles".
I have a small contribution.

        In England, there had been a long tradition of street vendors
using noisemakers to attract attention to their wares.  At one point,
parliament passed regulations to reduce noise so that "untuned bells"
were outlawed. presumably that allowed street musicians to continue
to play.  At any rate, the Victorians expressed part of their disdain
for trade by the phrase "bells and whistles", something that has little
to do with the real business but that catches the attention of the
undiscerning and vulgar crowd.

        There was also a bit of a sneer at those who had to resort to
"bells and whistles" in contrast to the more dignified members of
society, whose importance was made evident by other means.

        I think that fits in with the current use fairly well.  The last
tie-in with computers is that C. Babbage was violently opposed to any
noise made by street vendors, but especially to organ grinders.  I doubt
he actually used the phrase, but he wrote numerous letters to the local
police to enforce the law, and petitioned the authorities to ban
hawking and such on his street.  Cranky guy, judging from his letters.

        / Milt

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I wonder what Babbage would make of synthesizers.  Street organs,
after all, are drum-ROM musical output devices.

Subject: DCL -- useful feature, not a hack this time

Since Jerry Leichter broached the subject of "interesting" DCL
capabilities, here is a very nice feature that was added in VMS
3.1.  It gives you about 70% of the capabilities of MMS or
Unix Make in a few lines of DCL.  I've added it to a number of
command procedures that (for example) create an object file from
a source file.  This is, of course, my "model" file and may contain
typos.  Feel free to pass it on.

$! MINIMAKE.COM         build output if necessary.  Martin Minow
$       was_verify = 'f$verify(0)'
$!
$! The SOURCE file is processed to create the OUTPUT file.  This command
$! checks creation dates and does not compile if both files are present
$! and the OUTPUT file is newer (younger) than the SOURCE file.
$! This sequence defines the SOURCE and OUTPUT files:
$       SOURCE = P1
$       if SOURCE .eqs. "" then inquire SOURCE "Source File"

$! Continue at must_process if either file is missing or the source is younger.

A friend provided some more detailed information about the Game of Irregular
Verbs that I mentioned.  It was, indeed, introduced by Bertrand Russell on a
British radio programme (sic).  The programme was called "The Brains Trust",
and dates back much further than I thought - the 1920's.  He also provided
the following example:

        I may have mis-spoken.
        You erred.
        He lied.

(A very appropriate example for this friend - he's a lawyer!)

Then there is:

Subject: Indian Summer

I was engaged to a meteorologist for 2 years and he used to whisper
sweeth nothings in my ear about upper air patterns and such.  My
understanding of the term "Indian Summer" is that is denotes the
start of any period AFTER THE FIRST FROST (which is temperature as low
as 32 degrees) in which the high temperature is 60 degrees or higher.

Why they call it "Indian Summer" is open to conjecture, but Kermie,
this is still "Indian Summer" because this is still Fall.  Winter
doesn't start for another 14 days yet!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Who ever said the winter solstice was the official beginning of
winter?  The official seasons, on Desperado anyway, are

        Winter=Dec+Jan+Feb      Spring=Mar+Apr+May
        Summer=Jun+Jul+Aug      Fall=Sep+Oct+Nov

Otherwise, how could June 21 be Midsummer Night?  The Spring and Fall
Equinoxes and the Summer and Winter Solstices happen *during* their
respective seasons, they do not initiate them.  Besides that, I'm sick
of hearing people say every year up until December 21: "I'm freezing
and winter hasn't even started yet!"

On the other hand, if you think that's boring wait until the year 2000,
when I'll spend 18 months or more complaining that the 21st century
won't start until 2001, or, if that's too long, ask me about decades.

1. Re: spelling of PRIVILEGE.

   Another mis-spelling that drives me crazy is KERNAL for KERNEL.
   Perhaps we should standardize on COLONEL.  At least that doesn't

2. Re: Indian Summer.

   I thought this was a relic of the good old days of the British Raj.
   However, my Chamber's 20th. Century Dictionary defines Indian Summer
   as "(orig. in America) a period of warm, dry, calm weather in late
   autumn, with hazy atmosphere."  Doesn't give the derivation, though.

As far as Indian things, the first show of disrespect to "native" Americans
(they didn't come from here originally either, you know) was calling them
Indians, which of course they are not.  Although I don't care to get into
long discussions about who taught who about guerrilla warfare, when seen
from the eyes of the English-speaking residents of New England the Indians
(of New India?) were considered somewhat treacherous.  They would often
ambush unsuspecting colonists walking through what seemed to be harmless
sections of woodland or meadow.  Thus the English-speakers put a new
phrase in their language, "Indian Summer", a warm spell that puts you off
your guard for the snow and ice lying in ambush.

The various Indian languages have phrases that reflect on the deplorable
behaviour of the white man too, so we probably don't have to appologise for
"Indian Summer" or "Indian Giver", although we should appologise for "Indian
Pudding" since it neither comes from India nor has Indians in it.  But that's
one for the FDA to settle.  On the whole, since I have never killed an Indian,
nor had one attack me, I consider the whole question of who did/is/was what
to be moot.

Another favorite word for the word-abusers is 'occurence' [sic]. The all-time
champion, of course, is [sic again] 'compatability'; strangely, very few of
those who favor this spelling write 'compatable' (well, I find it strange).
