Now, I could be wrong about this, you understand, but I'm pretty sure that
the following prefixes are part of the "Systeme Internationale" (SI),
which is the international standard for metric and scientific prefixes
(I useta be a technical editor):

        mega (M): 10**6
        giga (G): 10**9
        tera (T): 10**12

Because this might cause confusion in Britain, one is supposed to avoid
use of "million" and "billion" and use either exponential notation or
such prefixes. I don't know of a standard prefix for 10**15 either.

Note that the really interesting thing is that, for example, a "megabit"
or "megabyte" is usually not 10 to anything, but is in fact a power of 2.
The VAX virtual address space consists of 4 "gigabytes": 2**30 ("giga")
bytes times 2**2 (that's 4, boys and girls), to take one example. So I
suppose a "terabit" is 2**40 bits, since a "K" is 2**10, an "M" is
2**20, and a "G" is 2**30.

Everyone else has already figured this out, I suppose, but I had a free
minute.... By the way, VAX BASIC sez that 2**40 is 1.09951e12--lots more
than 10**12.

My Merriam-Webster offers the following as a footnote to its table
of Denominations above One Million:

"The American system of numeration for denominations above one million
is the same as the French system, and the British system corresponds
to the German.  In the American system each of the denominations above
1,000 millions (the American *billion*) is 1,000 times the one preceding
(one trillion=1,000 billions; one quadrillion=1,000 trillions).

"In the British system the first denomination above 1,000 millions (the
British *milliard*) is 1,000 times the preceding one, but each of the
denominations above 1,000 milliards (the British *billion*) is
1,000,000 times the preceding one (one trillion=1,000,000 billions;
one quadrillion=1,000,000 trillions)."

I admire you and KHOTEK::BINDER for your wonderful faith in human
talent.  Unfortunately, most human-generated poetry doesn't carry any
freight at all per word...it's just words.  If people did understand
the definition you propose, and held poets to it, the poetry sections
of book stores would be even smaller than they are.  And the books of
poetry would be even dustier.  So, since I don't believe most people
can write poetry, or read it, I am not very offended at the idea of
computers writing it.  As my grandmother would have said, it can't
hurt.

PS:  If I put a few carriage returns in the above paragraph
where
they obviously didn't
belong

would accuse
                       me

I also agree that the Real Poem submitted by KHOTEK::BINDER is indeed
a real poem...which may just prove what we learned years ago in
writing classes applies equally to poetry: first you have to have
something to write about.

About a month or two ago I started getting an internal newsletter called
"MGMT MEMO", which, according to its subtitle, is sent to all of Digital's
supervisors and managers.  It is a wonderful little publication explaining
how each of us should become very conscious of ways to save money in our
work during these fiscally tight times.

Because I'm NOT a manager or supervisor and because I've never been a manager
or supervisor, and because everything that's been in the two issues I've
gotten so far has been trivial trash, I figured the best way I could save
the corporation some money would be to have my name deleted from "MGMT MEMO"'s
distribution list.  I sent a quick note off to the official "MGMT MEMO"
contact person.

Well, this week I got a reply from "MGMT MEMO".  It is a <b>form letter</b>
telling me that my name <b>cannot be deleted</b> from the list because of
information in my personnel master file!

I don't really mind having my name on their distribution list.  [I can whip
those "MGMT MEMO"'s in the recycle bin faster than they can mail them to
me.] What I do mind is their silly newsletter telling me to save money and
not be wasteful.

Curiouser and curiouser:  My supervisor is just about the only person in my
group whose name ISN'T on their distribution list.

What's an engineer to do?

I was interested to read Mr. Farrell's invitation to browse in his
account - which I did.  One of the games there is EMPIRE which I
used to play and now would like to implement on my home micro.
Does anyone have the sources, please?

This invitation set me thinking however : in the same issue as "Further
exploits of Kevin Mitnick"  (why don't WE offer him a job??),  we are
given an account name and password, and even a dial-up number!  For a
publication that is virtually in the public domain, isn't this a teeny
bit dangerous?  Mind you, the DEC-20, with its system of cryptic passwords
in place of commands should deter most people.

P.S.  In case you're wondering about the public domain bit - are you aware
      that all satellite transmissions (this one included) are monitored
      by a cubic mile of computers run by the NSA?  They look for keywords
      (such as NSA, I would guess. Probably Mitnick as well).

The recession, about which we hear so much at DEC, has obviously hurt

I'd be interested in hearing other people's reactions to DEC's advertising
campaign.  I find the print ads very poorly designed and cluttered, the
television spots confusing.  The visual keys to both the print and video
advertising (for instance, the three men in the TV commercial, and the
Pro on a chair next to a man on a chair in the newspaper ad) don't send
a very clear message or image.

This ad campaign is undoubtedly costing several bundles, but its
effectiveness seems questionable.  Any other thoughts on this?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
There is no punctuation mark harder to use than the comma; no, not
even the brooding semi-colon or the mournful hyphen.  Indeed, there
is an old writer's saying - and being an old writer, I say it all the
time - that goes:

        By their commas, ye shall know them.

KERMIT::J_ANGEL and SPIDER::COLLIER are bold indeed to venture into
this dungeon.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: SPIDER::COLLIER
To:   ALIEN::PARMENTER
Subject: One good comma deserves another.

I take substantial exception to J_ANGEL's fulminations about commas.
That they are misused is certainly true, but more people UNDERuse them
than OVERuse them.

The remarks about commas before 'because' seem off the wall.  In the
first place, clearly there are occasions when the necessity of a comma
preceding the word 'because' is beyond dispute, as in

        We learned only yesterday, because of non-delivery of mail,
        that your tove was slivey.

or
        The use of commas preceding words such as 'but', 'because',
        and 'and' is unexpectedly contoversial.

Presumably what was meant was something like this:

        When the word 'because' is used to establish a causal connection
        between an assertion immediately preceding it and the
        assertion following it (or a subject following it, preceded
        by 'of'), it should not be preceded by a comma.

But this, too, (even apart from being clumsily expressed) I would dispute.
I have consulted no authorities, but my gut tells me that as subordinate
avjectival phrases should be set off from their betters by commas, so, too,
should the subordinality of a 'because' phrase be flagged with that (sometimes)
lovely preceding comma.  Thus, note the NON-subordinate becauseness of:

        Q.  Why did Billy not go to school yesterday?
        A.  He did not go to school because he overslept.

versus the very subordinate, needing that oh-so-informative comma, usage of:

        Q.  How did Billy do in school yesterday?
        A.  He did not go to school, because he overslept.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Speaking for myself, I insert commas by a number of arbitrary
instincts. I almost always put them before the "and" in a series and
after any kind of introductory clause, and between any two entities
less than a sentence when I feel the need of a breathing space.  I
mean breathing space literally.  I test for comma location by reading
out loud.

And I can't follow that last example.

But I don't know too much grammar.

               A REAL POEM WRITTEN BY A REAL PERSON

From: KHOTEK::BINDER
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER

Tom, I have to agree with your assessment of poetry, that the words must
carry maximum, not minimum freight.  In support of this argument, I offer a
short poem that I saw recently, one written by a young man whose lover was
murdered:

        My love, the world has stolen you away
        With evil, brutal pain.  I know that you
        Did not depart with freely given will.
        My life was touched by sweetly shared amour,
        And never shall you wander far away
        From thoughts and dreams of time we shared in joy.
        You touched my heart and left me richer than
        I should by rights have been.  I won't forget.

I have a copy of this poem because it so exquisitely expresses the feelings
associated with the discovery of such a tragedy.  I was very much moved by
it.  Anyway, note the subtle things, like the assurance (for himself, likely)
that her death was not suicide, and the use of "shall" in the second person
and "will" in the first person, both usages implying determination rather than
simple statement.  Poetry is NOT possible for computers to write; the best that
a machine can produce is a string of words that fit a metrical structure and
just MIGHT happen to make some sort of sense.

Subject: Regarding the naming of animals: anything but this!!

I went cross country skiing last Sunday, hoping to escape the world of bits
and bytes for a few hours.  I was gliding down a gentle incline through a
grove of pine trees covered with snow, gawking at the crystalline splendor of
it all, when I heard a man off in the distance calling his dog:

        "Here TECO, here TECO, come on boy!!"

I immediately turned around and headed in the other direction, but it
was too late.  The image of rustic beauty had been shattered.  Is there
no end to people's depravity in the matter of naming their pets?

From today's WSJ:

A small publisher brings out "The Official Government Nuclear Survivors'
Manual: Everything That Is Known About Effective Procedures in Case of
Nuclear Attack."  The book is intentionally blank inside, but, according
to Publishers Weekly, one store returned its copies on the assumption
the printer had erred.
