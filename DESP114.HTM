The first woods meeting I ever attended featured Bill Johnson, a/k/a
"BJ".  At that time, he said, "If you're not having fun at your job,
then there's something wrong with your job."

Read on.

The following note is, you guessed it, flying around the net and
through many a notes file.  Maybe it's a hoax.  I don't know who Bel
Cross is.

*****************************************************************
*       THIS MESSAGE IS FROM BEL CROSS AND BILL JOHNSON         *
*****************************************************************

We have recently discovered that the DEC internal network is
being used for purposes other than the intended ones.  There are
numerous activities involving both files and electronic mails
that are clogging up the network and impeding our day to day
business.  When such things occur they work a hardship on all
users of the network by increasing response times, decreasing
needed throughput and adding to the cost.  We are strongly
requesting that this misuse be voluntarily stopped.

If you are creating a "file" that is non business related or are
creating "junk mail" (such as chain letters, etc.) please stop
doing it immediately.  If you are receiving "junk mail" please
delete it and above all do not forward it.  What may be funny,
cute or interesting to you may be offensive to someone else.
That alone is reason enough to stop.  When the other factors are
included it becomes intolerable.  Let's all work within the DEC
culture and stop this voluntarily so that formal steps are not
required.

Best Regards

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The network is the main carrier of the DEC culture.  We don't all work
in the Mill any more.

The company's stock in trade is distributed processing and
communications.  The proliferation of notes '"files'" and '"junk
mail"' is a natural outgrowth of distributed processing and
communications and we in this company and industry are creating new
forms of human interaction.

Naturally, if someone comes to me and says no more Desperado, I will
have to stop (and update my resume), but no one has said any such
thing in the five or so years I have been doing it, and, to tell the
truth, I'd be surprised if anyone did.

I'm also surprised that this 'misuse' of the net has been 'recently
discovered'.  I figured it out within a week of my KERMIT's going on
the net.

Sure, I get a lot of junk, and send a little, so we should raise our
standards, but to stop . . . I think it would cost the company much
more in the long run than the cost of CPU cycles, disk space, paper,
worker time, and leased wire cycles.  It would cost DEC its place in
the future.

In other words, all this stuff is business-related, even the license
plates.

    Subject: Styles of Confusion - Rev 1

    This memo is being sent for your review prior to general publication.
    Recent  changes  in  policy  require an update to the September, 1984
    DECWORLD article "Styles of Confusion".  This memo clarifies the four
    styles identified in the article and also adds a fifth style.

                           PERSONAL CONFUSION

    This is the  confusion  one  experiences  while  thinking  about  our
    low-end/PC  strategy.  For example, "which of the three PC's should I
    buy?".  Here one faces  the  choice  between  a  twelve  bit  machine
    (DMII), an eight bit machine (RB+), and a two bit machine (PRO).  The
    currently favored method for dealing with this style of confusion  is
    to go to The Computer Store and buy an Apple IIe.

                          LARGE-SCALE CONFUSION

    This is the confusion  which  occurs  when  many  large  systems  are
    connected  into clusters which then promptly crash.  The trouble with
    large scale confusion is that it takes a long time to get out of  the
    situation.   For example, a special variety of large scale confusion,
    VENUS Confusion, lasted for over seven years.   One  can  guess  that
    VENUS  Cluster  Confusion  will last even longer.  Possibly until the
    next Ice Age or Central  Engineering  Organization  Chart,  whichever
    comes first.

                             TEAM CONFUSION

    This type of confusion is the natural consequence of any  two  of  us
    trying  to  work together.  It is probably the easiest to resolve, we
    just stop talking to each other and resume our games of Dungeons  and
    Dragons,  Trivial  Pursuit,  etc.  Team confusion is our most ancient
    form of confusion.  It predates "doing the right thing"  and  existed
    even during the era of "let's make a few bucks this quarter".

                          WORKSTATION CONFUSION

    This  confusion  occurs  when  anyone  attempts  to  define  what   a
    workstation  consists  of.   The standard method of dealing with this
    confusion is to do the following mathematical operation:  WORKSTATION
    MANAGERS  :=  WORKSTATION  MANAGERS  - 1.  Note:  this operation only
    valid if WORKSTATION MANAGERS &gt; 0, the minus one case is unstable and
    could result in product shipment.

                          SOUR GRAPES CONFUSION

    This is  a  new  style  of  confusion.   It  is  caused  when  senior
    management  contemplates our "success" in the PC business and decides
    that PC's are "cheap, short-lived, and not very accurate".  Note that
    this  is not a stable area of confusion.  If PC sales take off like a
    rogket, watch this space for a revised statement.  Phrases like "wave
    of the future" will occur in the revision.

                            FURTHER CONFUSION

    It appears that further confusion awaits us in  the  future  (indeed,
    what  else?).   Details  are  not yet available, but there are rumors
    about "Kalbs of Confusion".  This could be a new type of DEC Galactic
    Confusion  and  it  might supercede all other forms.  New information
    will be published as soon as any unjustified  and  outrageous  rumors
    reach the author of this memo.

        According to an "informed" source, the State Department has been
        quietly negotating with a group of selected  high-tech companies
        which includes  Digital  to open manufacturing facilities on the
        island of Grenada.   The State Department is endeavoring to make
        good on its promise to bolster the sagging economy of the island
        nation after last year's invasion.

        Digital's  proposal was well-received by State,  but was refused
        by a Grenadian commission when it was learned that Digital could
        not give adequate assurance that  Tobin's  would  be kept off of
        the island.

The odd thing about the Odd Fellows is only that they are not Masons.
It is a secret society with lodges, rituals, rites, and degrees, death
benefits, and homes for orphans and old people.  Founded in 1819.  The
full lovable name:  the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.

Cokesbury is indeed from the early American Methodist church. It is
a compound of two names. The ones mentioned in the resent Desperado are
correct. Today Cokesbury is the name of a Methodist book and clerical supply
outfit (my father has been carrying their appointment books for 30+ years).

On a whole nother topic.

Turn-about seems to be fair play in license plates. I recently saw two
interesting plates.

A New Hampshire plate   LI-NY      (Can only mean Long Island, New York)

        and

A New York plate        SALEMNH     (NY allows 8 or maybe 10 letters)

From:   RAINBW::MAROTTA        26-NOV-1984 15:34
To:     AUTHOR::PARMENTER
Subj:   Response

RESPONSE TO AUTHOR::PARMENTER:

No, I don't think you are coming down hard on the Dictionary, as you put
it. But I do believe that in most instances of your critique you do not
have accurate facts or you are making assumptions.

Let me try to clarify your inaccuracies and show you where you are criticising
based upon what I feel are pure assumptions.

Let me try to address each point in the order that you presented them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Point ONE deleted
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

TWO: As far as the "missing" definitions (such as trademarks), let me give
you a little history of the Dictionary development. Since 1977, some various
persons and groups of persons "diddled" around from 4 to 5 years "building"
a dictionary. It never happened. In 1981, Bill Johnson (B.J.) suggested
that I and Armen Varteressian (then S/W Pubs. manager under Bill Heffner)
join the Dictionary Committee. B.J. wanted a technical Dictionary. Armen
subsequently left the company, I became chairperson of the Dictionary Committee
and pledged to B.J. and Joe Santini (ESD&amp;P) that I and the Committee would
publish the Dictionary by Dec 1, 1983. We went to press on Dec 5 1983.
This is one of the few DIGITAL publications that ever met press deadline
that I know of.

The objective of that First Edition was to provide a TOOL for translators
and other persons involved in the transfer of information about DIGITAL
products. WE KNEW AT THAT TIME THAT THE DICTIONARY WOULD BE INCOMPLETE
AS SOON AS IT WAS PUBLISHED. The major thrust was to get the damn thing
published, get CONSTRUCTIVE feedback, and improve it in the Second
Edition. Had we wnated to wait until the Dictionary was "perfect' , we would
have had to set a publishing date of 2000 A.D.

Moreover, the Dictionary Committee is a volunteer Committee. The Dictionary
was then and is now and unfunded project. Development was partially paid
for by Engineering and is now taking place as overhead in ESD&amp;P. The
production and printing is contracted by DEC Press. Under unfunded and
volunteer conditions, you cannot produce the "perfect", highest quality
product.

So if we missed the defintion or expansion of "RT" , excuse us. Just
let us know kindly, and we will be pleased to include that (and many
others that we already know about) into the Second Edition.

THIRD: I and the Committee cannot find anything amiss or remiss about
the VAX/VMS defintion of "abort." Certainly, we find nothing "cranky"
about VAX/VMS definitions. We , more appropriately, characterize your
critiques as such. ALL terms, definitions, etc. were verified for technical
accuracy and completeness by the development communities, and were
edited for readability by various, eminently qualified members of the
Committee.

Also, your comment about the definition of "ZAP" is indicative of a
poor attempt at humor from a critic who is criticising, it appears,
for his own amusement and amazement.

THE DICTIONARY COMMITTEE IS LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK (CONSTRUCTIVE) TO
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SECOND EDITION. WE NEED SINCERE, CONCERNED,
VIABLE INFORMATION ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE FIRST EDITION.
The appeal through NOTES went out to GET TERMS, DEFINITIONS, MNEMONICS,
ABBREVIATIONS, AND CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS. I reiterate that appeal
here; if you have such, please send it to me. This unfunded Committee
does not have the time to review feedback that is apparently based
on assumptions and that represents one person's biased opinions.

This Dictionary cannot be, never will be, was never intended to be
all things to all people.

FOURTH: Your criticism of the readability factor "switching terms"
gives further support to my allegation that you are criticising for
pure sake of criticising. The terms used in the example are just that:
examples. It matters not that they are defined in the Glossary Section;
it does matter that the reader understand, with help of examples, what
"term switching" is. Those example terms should be viewed in the context
of why they were written, not whether or not they appear in another part
of the Dictionary.
Incidentally, all three of those terms (CPU, processor, and computer)
were brought to our attention as missing from the Glossary by a word
processing clerk in Maynard in January of this year. Those terms
will be included in the Second Edition.

FIFTH: The introduction to the Glossary Section explains what is meant by
product-specific and DIGITAL-specific. Since you apparently missed
reading that section, DIGITAL-specific refers to a term that is used
the same way in providing information for AT LEAST 4 DIGITAL products
or systems.

There should be nothing "baffling" , as you put it, about certain terms
being DIGITAL-specific. Those terms are are used the same way in describing
AT LEAST 4 DIGITAL products.

What you are missing, as far as information is concerned, is not only
the defintion of DIGITAL-specific, but also that ALL TERMS ARE DEFINED
IN THE DICTIONARY ACCORDING TO HOW THEY ARE USED FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT
OR FOR SEVERAL PRODUCTS. That means that if "on line" is used for one
product, and "online" is used for another, THAT IS EXACTLY THE WAY THEY
ARE PUT INTO THE DICTIONARY.
This Dictionary is not intended to resolve inconsistencies, but to SHOW
inconsistencies. It is up to individual product or system areas to change
their terms and defintions for consistency sake; that is NOT the job of the
Dictionary Committee. TO SHOW HOW A TERM IS USED OR DEFINED FOR A PARTICULAR
PRODUCT IS AN INVALUABLE AID TO TRANSLATORS IN MORE ACCURATELY TRANSLATING
A TERM OR DEFINTIION INTO THEIR LOCAL LANGAUGES.

CLOSURE: My comments may appear defensive on the part of the Dictionary
Committee. I respectfully request that you do not interpret them that
way. My comments are attempts to clarify points that, I feel,  you have
based on assumptions and lack of accurate information.
I hope you do not become defensive in light of my comments; my objective
is not only to clarify misinformation for you, but to also indicate where
I feel you have failed to provide viable, usable feedback for the Second
Edition.

The Dictionary has been a valuable tool to many people (according to
feedback). It can be a valuable tool to many more. It is a start, and it is
a livng document, as stated in it's Introduction. That means that we realize
that it will never be complete or perfect.

I and the Committee have always welcomed constructive comments; that is our
philosophy and part of our policy. Our objective, now is to produce the
highest quality Second edition possible. We need much help. We welcome
your support and constructive comments.

I think if four Digital products use the same definition for a term,
it is likely that the term is industry-standard rather than
Digital-specific.

I'm going to reply to this off-line, but sit down with a copy of the
Dictionary yourself and see what you think.  My objection, in summary,
is that it is not a dictionary, but rather a collection of glossaries.

The Shorter Oxford Dictionary has the following definitions:

        Glossary - A collection of glosses; a list with explanations
        of abstruse, antiquated, dialectal, or technical terms; a
        partial dictionary.

        Gloss - A word inserted between the lines or in the margin
        as an explanatory rendering of a word in the text; hence, a
        similar rendering in a glossary or dictionary.  Also, a comment,
        explanation, interpretation.  Often in a bad sense:  A
        sophistical or disingenuous explanation.

        Dictionary - 1. A book dealing with the words of a language, so
        as to set forth their orthography [spelling], pronunciation,
        signification, and use, their synonyms, derivation, and
        history, or at least some of these . . . . 2. By extension: A
        book of inmformation or reference on any subject or branch of
        knowledge . . . as a Dictionary of Architecture, etc.

        Illustrative quotations: 1.  'Neither is a dictionary a bad
        book to read . . . it is full of suggestion - the raw material
        of possible poems and histories.' Emerson.  2.  'Burnet was
        . . . a living dictionary of English affairs.'  Macaulay.

The word [spelling] above is a gloss.  The previous sentence was a
gloss.  So was that one and so is this. And so on.

As for my being a smart-alec, someone defined 'constructive criticism'
as '2000 words of closely reasoned praise'.

Excerpt from DIGITAL Software Engineering Policy Handbook, Definitions
Section:

BAD ('bad) adj. 1. An imaginary condition or state of products or
    patches released by Software Engineering; an impossible situation
    which users invented to place blame for their problems on us.
    ("That patch is BAD.")   2. Slang for SIDE EFFECT or ASPECT.
    These terms should be strongly encouraged instead of the obvious
    contradiction "BAD" and "our products". ("Its not BAD. The resultant
    failure of your system to boot is a SIDE EFFECT."). See also
    COVER_YOUR_ASS.   3. The normal, expected state of SPR's submatted
    by users ("This SPR is BAD."). See also SUCKS, RIDICULOUS,
    GIMME_A_BREAK, and FIXED_IN_NEXT_RELEASE.

Subj:   high TECHNOLOGY

From the November 21, 1984 issue of Management Information Systems Week,
page 4.  A story about some drug dealers arrested at Apollo:

        Police Chief Raymond McKeon said the problem is not limited to
        Apollo.  "The whole high-tech industry is loaded with drugs."

Subj:   enough said?

Where do you begin in responding/reacting to the Mark Twain travesty that
appeared in Personal Times? I've tried a couple of times already, and keep
running into a fence badly in need of whitewashing...

The thing is so awful it defies a rational response. While it's not entirely
out of the question that Twain might have written about something like SAMNA
(he was, after all, a lover of technological gimmickry, and once lost upwards
of $300,000 on an investment in a mechanical typesetting device), it is beyond
belief that he would have resorted to the kind of wretched dialect perpetrated
in the article. (Can it be that he ever used the term "high-falutin'"?).

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I'd begin by quoting the thing.  It speaks for itself:

        "The way I see it, asking a writer fella to review a word
         processing package is like askin a fisherman for his
         favorite catfish bait.  He'll talk doughballs, 'cause his pap
         talked doughballs.  Meantime they'll be bitinng on crawdads.

        "That's human nautre.  If you learned on a particklar
         package, well then that's the bes one, bar none, as far as
         you're consarned.  Seems to me that a word processing package
         should be jedged on its *true effectiveness* . . . "

The way I see it, asking a internal PR fella to write like America's
greatest writer is bound to lead to lots of talk about doughballs and
pap, if you know what I mean.  It's enough to gag a catfish.

PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE THROUGHOUT YOUR GROUPS -- IT'S URGENT!!

Someone has been calling DEC employees claiming that they are from
the Telephone Company and asking people to verify their Credit Card
numbers.  You can just imagine what happens to your charges after
you give out the number!

DO NOT GIVE OUT OR VERIFY YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER TO ANYONE!!!
A memo with more details is forthcoming.

Hmmm... does anybody but me think that DEC (for all of their faults)
produces some of the nicest, clearest, and most usable documentation
around? A lot of companies could usefully emulate the glossy, 3 color,
step-by-step installation guides that DEC puts out. My !@#$%#$%$%^%V&amp;
rainbow had a manual that explained how to wnpack the stupid thing and
how to plug it in. This was overkill, but i have to admire the attempv.

Subj:   RE: fan mail

Thanks!  But I don't think it was overkill...  Better to document an
inherently simple procedure than leave it to chance -- except... IBM
would have done better by NOT including their installation manual(s),
maps, handouts, etc.!!

  Note #49             -&lt; Bad Joke of the Day (Ansi C) &gt;-         No responses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the minutes of the Ansi Standard C committee:

  "[Bill] Davidsen [committee member from General Electric] asked [Larry]
  Rosler [committee member from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories] what AT&amp;T's response
  to the standard would be.  Rosler made the usual disclaimers, but opined
  that AT&amp;T would doubtless support a standard conforming C compiler,
  plus any variants needed to support existing code, plus variants arising
  out of continued development of the C language.

Is this the last Desperado?  If so, it's been fun, and thanks for all
the fish.
