 short because it is a test designed to smoke out bad addresses.

 Here's a couple of shorties out of the file for you to finish this
 off.  Then I have the melancholy task of sitting down and sifting out
 all my fellow laid-off Digits before I send another, so keep those error
 messages coming in.

A colleague who recently returned from helping a group at Digital in
France writes:

   I was working at Digital until 10pm last night.  Quite a stressed
   environment, as they were trying to produce a release for Digital in
   Maynard that night.  Most of the people didn't bother to speak
   English unless they were talking with me.  Suddenly one of the
   engineers (actually a native English speaker, but you wouldn't know
   it from her French) blurted out "F2K!!", while staring at her
   terminal.  She suddenly realized I was there, turned to me, and
   exclaimed, "Pardon my French."

 It's taken me a while to get the hang of this new environment, but here
 we are.  See you soon, expanding exponentially out, working my way
 towards the world wide web and slouching towards Bethlehem at the same
 time.
