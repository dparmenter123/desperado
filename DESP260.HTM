Subject: What's a 'trilobyte' ???
Organization: nil
Date: Sat, 28 Jan 1995 02:55:13 GMT

(_not_ 'whatever it can chew'... :-)

I was reading an article by Karen Frenkel in the Comm. of the ACM,
July 1989, about "The Next Generation of Interactive Technologies", and
she quoted Nolan Bushnell in a keynote address to the Intertainment (sic)
'88 conference:

"Ultimately, 'what we really want is to have a whole world linked by
400 megahertz fiberoptic cable with about a trilobyte of memory in the
basement of every home,' he said.  Looking at the cost of memory and the
cost of bandwidth over the last 20 years, he postulates that 80 to 90
percent of American homes can have not a trilobyte, but a couple of
random access gigabytes within the next 20 years.  If that happens,
software will provide the solutions, he said." [???]

OK, so what's a 'trilobyte' ??  I presume by the discussion that it
is greater than a gigabyte (10^9).  Would he perhaps be meaning to
say 'terabyte' (10^12), or 'trillion-byte' ??

&gt;From my dictionary:

trilobite, n.  any of the Trilobita, a group of extinct arthropods,
variously classed with the crustaceans or the arachnidans or as
intermediate between these, with a flattened oval body varying in
length from an inch or less to two feet, their remains being found
widely distributed in strata of the Paleozoic era, and important as
being among the earliest known fossils.

(I think that I have some trilobites in _my_ basement...)

&gt;From the January, 1995 InterNetwork "The Manager's Magazine of Standards
and Interoperability", page 16:

"Digital Goes With Network Flow Control" (article about DEC's Gigaswitch).
Sidebar shows picture with caption "Digital's ATM Gigaswitch supports
1.1 Gigawatts of throughput."

At the Chestnut Hill Cinema they run slides filled with info-nubbins mostly
about movies.  Apparently 81% of all films released in the last 50 years
contain the immortal line:

        "Let's get out of here!"

81%!!!!! This must be the quintessential American thought.

   EXCERPTS FROM THE DILBERT LIST ON HOW TO GET ON THE DILBERT LIST
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Excerpted-from: Dilbert Newsletter 4.0

Problems Getting on the Dilbert List
------------------------------------

Many people reported problems getting on the Dilbert mailing list.
Some couldn't sign up automatically.  Others didn't receive Newsletter
V3.0 and wondered if they had been excommunicated.

The lesson: Being on the Dilbert list is neither a right nor a
privilege; apparently it's luck.  I don't know what the heck is going
on.  I referred the problems to my customer service organization but
they just continued to lay in sun spots on my rug and lick their fur.

***************** General Dilbert Facts *******************

The cartoon strip Dilbert began in 1989.  It now appears in 400 papers
in 10 countries.  The author (that would be me) receives up to 100
e-mail messages per day.

Despite what you've heard, I don't work at your company (unless your
company is Pacific Bell, where I work in the ISDN lab).

I read all of my e-mail personally.  But obviously I've automated many
responses.  If you get a canned response it just means my fingers are
tired.
 I love you, really.

How to Subscribe Automatically
------------------------------

You can subscribe to the Dilbert List automatically by sending an
e-mail to the address listproc@internex.net with ONLY this message in
the body of your e-mail:

          subscribe Dilbert_List Joe Blow

    (except put your real name instead of Joe Blow).

Don't put anything in the subject line.  And your e-mail address will
be picked up automatically, so you need not specify it.

If the automatic method doesn't work for you, send me a note at
scottadams@aol.com and I'll put you on manually.

Problems Signing Up for the Newsletter
--------------------------------------

If you tried unsuccessfully to subscribe to the newsletter just send
e-mail to me and I'll sign you up manually.  My personal address is
still scottadams@aol.com

If you got a strange message saying you can't change your password,
ignore it.  The password isn't useful in this application.

What's with all this save the world ecology crap anyhow?

When you go to a grocery store they ask "Paper or plastic?"
Well hmmmmm, let's see.  If I choose plastic there's CFC's and filling up of
our landfills.  If I choose paper that's wasting trees.  Ah hell, just shove
it up a spotted owl's ass and I'll be on my way.

The following letters were in today's Dallas Morning News and concerned
Mr. Armey's "slip."

Got Mine Right
     I am struck by the fact that Congressman Dick Armey blamed the media
for publicizing his reference to Rep. Barney Frank.  Oddly, in the years
we taught together at the University of North Texas, he never had trouble
pronouncing my name.  Was this because I am a married heterosexual, or
because there were no media present?   --Frank B. Feigert, Denton

Subject: [Fortune Cookie Compiler Diagnostics]

&lt;forwards removed&gt;

From: booda@lynx.navo.navy.mil
&gt;     Maybe it's because I ate Chinese last night, but I got a couple of cc/ldr
&gt; diagnostics today that sounded a LOT like what you'd read on fortune cookie
&gt; fortunes:
&gt;
&gt; cc-172 cc: WARNING file = /u/xb/aagp/new_aagp/aagp_setup.c, Line = 185
&gt;   No code is generated for a superfluous expression.
&gt; [...]
&gt; ldr-133 cc: WARNING
&gt;     Unsatisfied external references have been encountered.
&gt;
&gt;      Doesn't it seem that the folks who write compiler diagnostic messages
&gt; moonlight as writers in Fortune Cookie factories?  The same
&gt; terseness, the same mystical obscurity, the same vaguely
&gt; threatening equivocation.  I almost expect the diagnostics to be
&gt; followed by winning lottery numbers.
&gt;      I began to consider the confusion if diagnostics were somehow
&gt; mixed up with the fortunes.  Imagine the reaction of a diner opening
&gt; up a cookie and seeing:
&gt;
&gt;     "Variable "buf" is used before it is assigned."
&gt;
&gt;      ...especially if that is, indeed, the problem in the program he's debug-
&gt; ging at work!  (Rod Serling, are you listening?)  And imagine the popularity
&gt; of a compiler which provided _really_ useful information, like:
&gt;
&gt;     "The inflexible man forgets that the rice is harvested by bending."
&gt;
&gt;      every time it encounters a syntax error.  The best idea, I think, is to
&gt; come up with phrases which could be used equally well either as fortunes _or_
&gt; diagnostics:
&gt;
&gt;     "It is most unwise to build upon an undefined structure."
&gt;     "The sow mates not with the bull; nor the int * with the char."
&gt;     "Correct previous errors before persevering to gather objects."
&gt;     "Ambiguous references presage Bus Errors; pause and reflect."
&gt;     "The wise nightingale contains its new nest entirely within the old."
&gt;     "Help!  I'm a prisoner in an ADA factory!"
&gt;
&gt;      (hehe, just kidding with that last one)  The sum effect of such an
&gt; effort would be to both improve the computer literacy and
&gt; programming ability of the general (well, at least those who
&gt; frequent Chinese restaurants) public, and to cultivate wisdom and
&gt; aesthetic tranquility amongst programmers, who sorely need it.

 Hey, those AOL people really suck don't they?  And, at this very
 moment, I don't doubt that AOL is full of people complaining about
 all the AOL newbies brought in by paving the entire world with
 floppies for ten hours of free AOL time.

 In addition to crow, the next Desperado has a neat AOL hack.
