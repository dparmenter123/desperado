        The Malcolm Balridge prize is presented by the Department of
        Commerce to US firms for industrial wonderfulness and quality.
        However, the prize itself is such a fragile crystal and chrome
        construction that recipients are presented only with a photo of it
        at the awards ceremony.  They get the real thing later in a padded
        crate and it's their responsibility henceforth.  It turns out, by
        the way, that this prize, often called "the prestigious Balridge
        prize" is something that you apply for and campaign for.  It's not
        enough just to be industrially wonderful and rife with quality.
        You have to connive like a movie star chasing an Oscar too.

The article about "Sandy Kidd's anti-gravity invention" sounds very
reminiscent of the "Dean Drive" of thirty years ago.  The Dean Drive was
featured prominently in Astounding magazine, one of the sf "pulps" of
the time, as the technology to revolutionize space travel in the coming
decade.

The best comment on this stuff was made by Marvin Minsky, who submitted
the following to SF-Lovers digest and Space-Digest at the time of some
discussion about the Dean Drive in 1982.

===============
From: Marvin Minsky@MIT-AI (Sent by MINSKY@MIT-AI)
Date: 01/17/82 00:25:30
Subject: Dean Machine History
To: space at MIT-MC, sf-lovers at MIT-MC

Shortly after the Dean drive was described in Astounding, John Campbell
published a picture of it.  I examined the picture with a lens and
managed to read the brand name of the bathroom scale used to measure the
loss of weight of the machine.  My college roommate, Roland Silver, and
I conjectured correctly that this scale had a "diode" in it that coupled
the platform and the reading device.  So we went to Sears Roebuck in
Porter Square, Cambridge and bought that very scale.

When you stand on it it reads your weight fine, but if you pump your
arms up and down -- just as did the dean machine itself -- then the
weight fluctuates a lot -- with the mean weight (and even the maximum)
far below the real weight.

So then Claude Shannon and John Pierce and I wrote a sharp detailed letter
to Campbell about this.

John Campbell didn't print our letter, but he sent me (knowing I was the
instigator) a long letter that I still have here, denouncing
establishment scientists for their reactionary and unimaginative
rigidity and general intolerance.

Suitably chastened, I dropped the matter and continued with my
reactionary, establishment-bound studies.

Anyway, this incident jibes with Pournelle's account about Cambell
seeing the machine which "jumped around a lot" on a bathroom scale.  I
checked out all the other scales, too, and finally found one that reads
high when you bounce.  But these were much less common.  So, possibly,
Dean was hoist by this pitiful petard.  But I maintained that this was
extremely unlikely since, obviously, he was all too familiar with
flakey, vibrating, weighing mechanisms.

  -- marvin

P.S..  I should add that much as we hated him, we loved him [Campbell]
greatly too, and for all he did for all of us.  And same for
G. Harry Stine.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The most amazing thing in Marvin Minsky's account is that he was able to
blow up a halftone photo from Astounding Science Fiction and read the name of
the scale.  Astounding was a pulp in every sense of the word and the art
reproduction was a dead loss.

Most of the delay in getting this issue of Desperado out has been consumed
in a futile search for two books I have with discussions of the Dean Drive
in them.  The essence of the Dean Drive was that it pushed "up", but didn't
push "down".  This was demonstrated by putting it on a bathroom scale and
watching the numbers jiggle while the Dean Drive vibrated.  As someone once
said, "I had a scale like that once."  At any rate, I'm sick of having this
logjam on my hands, so I'm shipping out without Martin Gardner and John
Sladek on the Dean Drive, but I'll keep searching.

I am somewhat concerned about the continuing use of Deperado for
commercial endorsements.  Yes, I know that public radio and TV
stations do this, too.  But they at least are explicit that it is in
return for sponsorship.  What is it that Daring and Whimsy have done
for you? (and shouldn't you at least capitalize their name?)  Besides,
you need to identify them better.  I can't find them listed anywhere;
I've tried Travel, Airlines, Steamships . . . you name it.  And they
aren't in the white pages, either.  I realize that they may be a
foreign firm, but since they claim to provide world wide service, the
least they could do is list a local 800 access number.

To: Multiple recipients of list NEW-LIST &lt;NEW-LIST%NDSUVM1@uunet.UU.NET&gt;

SHAKSPER on LISTSERV@UTORONTO International Shakespeare Conference

   Since its initial announcement this past summer, the International
   Electronic Shakespeare Conference, SHAKSPER, has grown steadily and
   moved in new and exciting directions.  I would like to take this
   opportunity to describe some of the changes in SHAKSPER, and to
   invite those who might have missed the initial announcement to join
   us.

   SHAKSPER is a scholarly BITNET seminar modelled on HUMANIST,
   currently involving more than ninety Shakespearean researchers,
   instructors, students, and interested amateurs from seven countries.
   A number of national and international Shakespeare organizations have
   expressed an interest in formal involvement, and a number of
   traditional journals have announced it to their readership.

   The SHAKSPER Fileserver offers conference papers and abstracts, an
   Index to Scholarly Works in Progress, an International Directory of
   Shakespeare Institutes, a Directory of Shakespearean Conferences and
   Calls for Papers, biographies of conference members, and reference
   files on a wide variety of subjects.  Members of a number of seminars
   at the upcoming SAA Conference in Vancouver will find their
   colleagues ready to share papers, comments, and strategies in
   advance.  SHAKSPEReans also gain indirect access to the SHAKSPER
   Quarto/Folio Textbase, a 17-megabyte textbase of all 55 authoritative
   quarto and folio texts of the 38 plays.

   The daily SHAKSPER digests offer an opportunity for informal
   discussion, eavesdropping, peer review, and a fresh sense of
   worldwide community.  Conference announcements, Shakespeare
   Association bulletins, member notes and queries, book and theatre
   reviews, textual debate, discussion of lecture strategies -- SHAKSPER
   has already logged all this and much more.

   No academic qualifications are required for membership in SHAKSPER,
   and anyone interested in English Literature, the Renaissance, or
   Drama is welcome to join us.  Write to the editor, Ken Steele
   &lt;KSTEELE@vm.epas.utoronto.ca&gt;, or send the command
         SUB SHAKSPER firstname lastname
   to LISTSERV@UTORONTO in the body of mail or via an interactive
   message such as
         TELL LISTSERV AT UTORONTO SUB SHAKSPER firstname lastname
   and you will receive a more detailed information file with further
   instructions for becoming a SHAKSPERean.  (SHAKSPER is not open to
   automatic subscription, but no one is refused.)

   Editor:  Ken Steele  &lt;KSTEELE@vm.epas.utoronto.ca&gt;

   (Please consider forwarding this announcement to
   colleagues who might be interested, whether or not they
   are currently using Bitnet, or posting a paper copy in
   your English or Drama department.)

"Come on now, Roger or Francis?  I thought you meant Francis."
"Which one invented gunpowder?"
"So who got the *best* bed?"
"You idiot, the Chinese invented gunpowder."
"Anybody got a good recipe for making skyrockets?"
"Damn all oppressive laws that won't permit us to blow up whatever we
want."
"I hate cops!  Hate'em, hate'em, hate'em."
"Listen to this, I had some tickets to a Living Color concert and I was

I got the following right after the November election, but then I held it
back figuring it would become a national scandal and I wouldn't have to
write about it.  Well, the national scandal went the other way, and,
following somewhat vaguely on Ezra Pound's that "literature is news that
stays news", I guess this is still literature for the time being.

Subject: NC elections

Well, I got a front-line view of the NC election, and it's not pretty!  Some
of the things in the list below you may know about, since they've been on the
news, and some may not be things you've heard.  All are true, to the best of
my knowledge....

        - Republican party erroneously mails postcards to voters saying that
you will be denied right to vote if you've moved in last 30 days

        - false &amp; misleading ads by Helms campaign (details available from
locals here, TV ad on broadcasting station in particular)

        - voting machines in Durham &amp; Greensboro subject to frequent
breakage, w/rumours going around on exactly how to break them

        - repair persons did not arrive until late evening (9pm) at at least
one site (forest hills), took only simple adjustments to fix machines
quicklyu

        - Helms protesting court order, saying it was democratic trick;
someone erroneously informed CBS news that the court order had been struck
down, resulting in Fayetteville (lgst density black neigborhood in Durham)
polls closing down

        - handicapped people denied curbside access in many polling stations

        - delivery of large quantity of curbside ballots at Forest
Hills &amp; Greensboro at 8pm, but they were not distributed or made
avilable (even upon request from special-needs voters) until 10pm

        - Democratic HQ in Raleigh had power &amp; phone lines cut the night
before the election; service wasn't restored until evening on Tuesday

It all doesn't sound like much, but being here and talking to the people is
pretty creepy.  Yesterday at lunch we talked to the cafeteria lady at the
register, and she was telling us that at 9am there were only 2 out of 5
voting machines working at Fayetteville, and she was 2 hours late to work.
My friends who were volunteering at Forest Hills last night (right down the
block) told me about a woman in labor who came by twice within an hour
period, waiting about 10-15 minutes each time and was denied a curbside
ballot. She eventually had to give up and go to the hospital.  Handicapped
people in wheelchairs were shivering outside, the lines to the polls looked
like 2 or 3 times the volume of a Friday-night Tosci's line in summer, and
the most oft-repeated phrase of the day was "I can't believe it", followed
by some statement about how mucked up the whole process had become.

By 9pm, there were folks who'd been in line for almost 3 hours. Around
then, a repairman finally showed up-- I don't know if he was the first one
or not.  It took him only 20 minutes to fix 3 out of 5 of the machines.
Where had he and his compatriots been for the last 12 hours, one wonders,
and why weren't they doing a constant round, since the fixes were that
simple?

&gt;From the election results, Helms would have won even if Durham voting had
gone without a snag, or so it seems.  But people here are very angry and
confused.  The whole business seems like something out of a gangster movie,
or old political reports of Daly's Chicago.  It's like being on another
planet, or at least in a different country.  I stayed mostly out of it, but
walked the puppydog down to the polls at 9:30 or so to see how Shava &amp;
Eddie were doing.

It was a scene from some surreal picture, lines of people, some with small
children, fires burning in steel trashcans and flame-lit silhouttes bending
down to rub their cold hands over the warmth.  The Gantt volunteers had
mobilized (despite the difficulties in contacting HQ, without power or
phones for many hours by that time), there were tables with hot coffee and
donuts, milk &amp; cookies for the children.  A local pizza house (Satisfaction
Pizza) been cajoled into providing a number of pizzas in return for
"neighborhood appreciation".  I daresay that the neighborhood was quite
appreciative, with many cold &amp; hungry folks stubbornly waiting the 2, 2.5,
finally 3 or more hours in line to exercise their franchise.  Volunteers
held places in line so that children could wait with their parents in a
warm meeting room inside. People talked with their neigbors, muttered to
themselves, settled into stony silences, but stayed in that line!  I don't
watch TV, I was ignorant of the local conditions surrounding this election,
but I was nonetheless impressed by the determination these people showed.
Whatever has been going on here politically clearly means a great deal to
them, and they were determined to have their one voice, one vote. But many
of them seem to feel that they had to work harder than they ought to have
to get it, in a country that prides itself on its democratic system.

And me, I'm sitting here in front of a terminal, bright sunlight streaming
in through the window, a fine cloudless sky overhead, office heater purring
at my feet.  Yet there's a touch of chill, a hint of shadow, a nameless
uneasy feeling that the utterly placid normalcy of today fails to dispel.
I just can't get last night out of my mind.

Sure, the "will of the people" wasn't thwarted as far as we know. Helms
would have won anyway, the people turned away wouldn't have given Gantt a
clear majority.  But all the "coincidences", the power outages, the "30
days" cards, the absent repairmen, etc-- this is supposed be
*civilization*, this is supposed to be *democracy*.  But polling machines
that have served faithfully for year after year "suddenly broke" and stayed
broken all day.  CBS News was told that the court order keeping polls open
had been overturned and broadcast that without verification, resulting in
the early shutdown at Fayetteville.  Power &amp; phone lines to the Raleigh
Democratic HQ were *cut* the night before the election and service wasn't
restored until evening.  Handicapped voters waited in the cold for hours.
Lots of nasty behind the scenes stuff happened all over the area.

It's all a bit overwhelming.  This is why I set out to travel, to see
different things and different ways.  But I didn't expect to travel back in
time....

Just sign me,

    "Figure 1.  View of ON/OFF POWER switch as seen while
     leaning over from front of machine looking at back."

Above the caption was an *upside down* picture of the rear
of the HP-85, just as the caption explained.

I damn near fell over laughing while reading that manual.

And of course, after you reflect on it there is hardly any reason to be so
'helpful' and make the program so general, instead of simply having it read
  "And then hit the space bar"
and be done with it -- no ambiguity, no confusion, no nothing...

My favorite story from my days selling PCs on the phone was the guy who
called up and wanted to order a _slot_.  After some cross-examination,
he finally explained that he'd bought a bus mouse, and the box said
"requires one slot".

        I worked as a computer lab monitor while I was attending college.  We
had an IBM PS/2 Model 25 out front, running a "Welcome" message.  Taped
to it was a sign that said "You must give your I.D. to the monitor".  So, the
new users, eager to demonstrate their new-found computer knowledge, did just
that.  They gave their ID to the "monitor" by putting it in the drive slot!!

        Some other good ones:

The guy who kept losing his disk, so he decided he'd stick it to the fridge
with a magnet...

The guy who was running an application, and got an error message "door open",
so he got up and closed the office door....

The guy who tried to format 6 disks at once by stuffing them all in the drive..

The guy who read in the manual that he needed a 'clean disk', so he put one
in the dishwasher...

Here's a dialog, related to me by one of my co-workers, who was helping
a novice unix user, and needed to check a configuration file..

support-engr&gt; ...ok, do a "more" on /etc/hosts.

customer&gt; it says, "moron: command not found".

The topic on credit cards in macs, etc. reminds me of a story I heard
(on this net? probly).  A support type gets a call from a customer
having problems with booting their system.  They said it sure was a
pain getting the floppy out of the cardboard wrapper and why did
they package them that way?   (He was trying to remove the floppy
from its case!)

*many* years ago I worked at Datapoint Corporation in San Antonio, TX. We
received a call one day (tech support) from a customer who said that he
couldn't get his system to read a particular diskette. Our rep asked the
guy to make a copy of the diskette, send it to us, and we'd see what we
could do. Well, a few days later, an envelope arrived from the customer.
When we opened it, there was a copy of the diskette --- a nice, 8-1/2 x 11
Xerox copy. THIS IS A TRUE STORY!!! Kind of scary, isn't it...

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
So, are these stupid users or, just maybe, unenlightened computerists who
don't necessarily immediately come up with the best way of communicating
with their users?  It's not scary that there are users who'll copy a disk
by sticking it in the Xerox machine unless the place you work isn't doing
anything to sell computers to that kind of people.  There's a lot more of
them than there are of us, and they have more money

           Overhead in a stairwell:  "I keep getting confused by the word
           `standards'."

Nothing to be confused about, really:

stand-ard (n) 1 : a figure adopted as an emblem by a people 2: the
personal flag of a ruler

You must "pledge allegiance to" or "embrace" it, to avoid the wrath
of the millions.  That's all there is to it.

The computer industry has its own laws on this topic: new standards,
once announced, can never be burned, *not even* if they are worn out
and tattered.  Hence the present situation of dozens and dozens of
simultaneous standards...

I'm going to skip the Lotus Marketplace controversy.  It's been pretty well
whanger-bopped to death on the net.  The best comment I saw ran about like
"You're all mad because a company you know is doing this stuff, but it's
going on all over the place and, if anything, Lotus is probably a good deal
more ethical in its approach to the business than some back-alley operator
in Chicago."

If you use a credit card, subscribe to a magazine, get counted in the
census, are on a payroll, you're in a bunch of databases.  At some point,
we'll probably be able to use the Shockwave Rider defense, but that won't
be until all the databases are integrated.  In the meantime, unless you
plan to do all your business on a cash basis face-to-face, what are you
going to do?  And, if you conduct all your business on a cash basis
face-to-face, the IRS is going to be very interested in you.

Nonetheless, here's one windfall from the Lotus controversy that I thought
I'd pass along.

Subj:   Re:  Lotus Marketplace and Consumer Privacy

Those who are particularly het-up over this issue, and there
do seem to be some, might consider this an opportunity to
join CPSR, the Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility.  Privacy is one of the many concerns on the
CPSR agenda (along with Privacy, Crime, Weapons, Education,
Workplace, and International.)  In this group you will find
a source of solid information on the issues as well as an
outlet for any energy you may have for working on causes
related to the impact of computer technology on society.

There are local chapters in many areas where smbx alumni/ae
are concentrated, including Boston, Palo Alto, Austin TX,
Berkeley, LA, and so on.  For information on CPSR, contact
them at P.O. Box 717, Palo Alto CA 94302-0717.  The basic
membership costs $40.  Just send 'em a check and you'll
start getting the newsletters.  For bigger bucks, you can
get things like posters or copies of the working papers, all
the way up to life membership for $1000, which entitles you
to a T-shirt :-)

Seriously, this is an important organization that you should
consider joining if the prospect of Lotus Marketplace has
you thoroughly alarmed.  (The thing that pushed me over the
edge into membership was hearing a talk on virtual reality.)
This is an organization with a voice in Washington and with
ongoing initiatives in a number of important areas, like the
civil liberties of those arrested for running computer
bulletin boards on which stolen information was distributed
(yes, it has happened).  Mitch Kapor kicked in $200,000; now
it's your turn...

I've sat on this dang thing for weeks, trying to decide whether to run it
or not, and now I decided.  In the first place, we almost never get any
rude humor from or by women, and this is surely no more offensive than
that urinal thing I ran last time, and finally, this is the last thing in
here, so if you're too chicken to go on past the title, drop out now.  I
showed this to the little woman (Mrs. Desperado) and she laughed a lot,
but then, she would, wouldn't she?  Anyway, this is a multi-forward with
all the forwarders deleted.

            SUBJECT:  ODE TO A MAMMOGRAM

    I had a mammogram today, and the following poem was taped up to the
    side of the machine.  The technician said one of her patients had
    brought it in.  When I left, she handed me a Xerox copy.

                        Ode to a Mammogram

    For years 'n years, they told me
    "Be careful of your breasts.
    Don't ever squeeze or bruise them,
    And give them monthly tests."

    So I heeded all their warnings
    And protected them by law...
    Guarded them very carefully,
    And always wore a bra.

    After 30 years of careful care
    The doctor found a lump.
    He ordered up a MAMMOGRAM
    To look inside that clump.

    "Stand up very close," the nurse said
    As she got my tit in line.
    "And tell me when it hurts," she said.
    "Ah yes!  There!  That's just fine!"

    She stepped upon a pedal...
    I could not believe my eyes!
    A plastic plate was pressing down...
    My BOOB was in a vise!!!

    My skin was stretched 'n stretched
    From way up by my chin.
    And my poor tit was being squashed
    To Swedish pancake thin!!!

    Excruciating pain I felt,
    Within its vice-like grip...
    A prisoner in this vicious thing.
    My poor defenseless tit!!!

    "Take a deep breath," she said to me.
    Who does she think she's kidding?
    My chest is smashed in her machine.
    I can't breathe and woozy I am getting.

    "There, that was good," I heard her say
    As the room was slowly swaying.
    "Now let's have the other one."
    "Lord, have mercy," I was praying.

    It squeezed me up and down.
    It squeezed me from both sides.
    I'll bet she's never had this done
    To her tender little hide!

    If I had no problem when I came in,
    I surely have one now...
    If there had been a cyst in there,
    It would have popped ... Ker-Pow!!!

    This machine was made by man -
    Of this I have no doubt...
    I'd like to get his balls in there.
    For months he's go "WITHOUT"!!!

                                    =*=

        Ah, you read it, didn't you, and it didn't kill you and you won't
        kill me, and the republic still stands.

        A huge pile of unabsorbed Desperado stuff is turning into compost
        while I work on this one, so I guess I'd better stop and move on to
        the next one.  Rock'n'roll hall of fame thoughts coming next time
        out, for sure, I may have to stop making these predictions; it gets
        embarrassing.
