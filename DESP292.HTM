 If you wonder why the Unabomber was able to swing a twelve-page
 supplement to the Washington Post financed by the Post and the New
 York Times consider that the Department of Justice was breathing down
 their necks insisting on it and that the Unabomber's victims have all
 been the kind of people who subscribe to the Times and the Post,
 professors and executives, not Oklahoma City nobodies trying to get
 their social security straightened out.

 Drop back a notch from your netskimming with NetScape and try running

 Note the unnecessary stains edited edited out of the classical source
 by the ignorant mob from Proverbs 16:18: "Pride goeth before

 Speaking of an haughty spirit, the throwaway shopper pub Computer
 Currents has a piece on support, consisting mainly of answers to the
 most common questions asked by users.  The very first question was
 "Word for Windows' setup stops before it finishes.  How do I keep
 this from happening?"  There's a six-step program to make MicroSoft's
 OS install MicroSoft's Word, which claims to be "for" Windows.

        Remove all non-required drivers and all shells.

        Close all other applications, including virus-checkers and
        screen savers.

        Override "enhanced 386 mode" by starting Windows with WIN/S.

        Override any MS-DOS SUBST commands affecting your access to
        SHARE.EXE.

        Install SHARE.EXE with L at 500 and F at 5100.

 Keep in mind that this is the most popular program running under the
 most popular operating system made by the same company and the setup
 program won't run unless you touch the tip of your nose with the tip
 of your tongue while diddling your SHARE.EXE.

 For my sins, I own three "terminal emulators", but not one of them
 can log me without my typing both username and password by hand.  All
 three claim they can do this, but a total of 24 hours spread across
 three programs has not produced a single authenticated instance of
 automatic login.

 I may have said this already.

 I love a Mac, and it may be the next system I buy, but I can't join
 in on all the smug self-directed hosannas about how Macs had it all
 in '85.  If Macs had progressed as much in the last ten years as DOS
 has (DOS is the old name for Windows), you might not even know the
 name Bill Gates.  Instead, they haven't progressed at all, and this
 morning I read in a PC rag that Macs have "a Windows95-like
 interface".

"The Mac has been dead in the water since 1985 in terms of its user
 interface.  And Windows is still a sort of caricature of the Mac.
 Windows 95 doesn't really get it.  The user interface is not very good."

   of Microsoft's Windows software

"You think it's a conspiracy [by] the networks to put bad shows on TV.
 But the shows are bad because that's what people want.  It's not like
 Windows users don't have any power.  I think they are happy with
 Windows, and that's an incredibly depressing thought."

MorseMcFadden Communications certainly knows how to attract hits to its
Web site -- it's posting photos of Bill Gates' $50 million mansion,
currently under construction.  About 67,000 people a day are reportedly
taking the tour of "Walls 96."  &lt; http://www.morsepr.com &gt;  (Investor's

 Surf-Watch is the company that compiles a list of all the naughty
 sites on the net and puts them in a secret database (updated monthly)
 so their software can prevent your kids from looking.  Could they
 make more money selling an open database of all the naughty sites?
 Maybe they have a secret subsidiary.  I mean, data is data, right?

   Proudhon quotes notwithstanding, this is just a thinly disguised
   apologia for the rightist gun freak militias.  What does the author
   think those illegal shotguns were going to be used for, and does he
   seriously believe they were the only ones Weaver sold?  They were
   intended as instruments of murder to be used on people that the
   Weavers of this country do not consider white enough or Christian
   enough or reactionary enough for their taste.

Well, it may surprise you that the author is a happy Barney Frank
voter and proud owner of a Sears BB gun.  I also spent six years as a
police reporter in Chicago, mostly at night, and I know what the cops
are up against.  I didn't like it when Fred Hampton and the Black
Panthers were gunned down.  I didn't like the Move Commune massacre.
I didn't like the Symbionese Liberation Front massacre.  I didn't like
the Waco massacre.  And I didn't like Ruby Ridge.  I don't like the
whole trend toward militarization of the police.  I should think that
as a military person you too would recoil from that proposition.  If
there's a need for a seige to control someone, I think the military
should be called out to conduct it.  I'd think that any military
person would be shocked by the so-called "rules of engagement" that
were in effect at Ruby Ridge and further shocked at actions that went
well beyond those foolish rules of engagement.  I don't know what
those illegal shotguns were going to be used for.  That question
should be put to the BATF.  They not only put Randall Weaver up to
selling them, they actually taught him how to make sawed-off shotguns.
And, since anyone with a hacksaw and $20 can have a sawed-off shotgun,
same-day-service, just how many cops do you think it will take to
control them?  I believe that there are plenty of Americans on the
left and right who are legitimately concerned about the increasing use
of force by the government against its citizens.

To sleep, perchance to dream... (1)

To go, perchance never to return.

Yes, the unknown beckons, seducing you with the idea that it has something
better, something more interesting, something more exciting and just plain
something MORE!

But as you get to know an unknown, it no longer remains the alluring unknown,
but becomes the commonplace.  Remember, your known is someone else's unknown
and vice versa.  You've learned something new, you've seen something you hadn't
before, you've gained an experience.  All very worthy.  But you've lost
something for possible discovery, you've lost a future opportunity and worst,
you've lost the dream of what might be, because you now know what is.

I heard this song when I was a child:  (Forgive the paraphrase and the awkward
translation, but although I believe the original is in English, I only ever
heard it in German.)

Even as a child, I knew
That to always be in one place
Was too much for me to bear.
I read books day and night.
And always dreamed,
That one day I would be
Five thousand miles from my home....

And as our hero grew up he really had the opportunity to travel and found
himself to be "Five thousand miles from my home...."  And he saw that wherever
he travelled he found wonder and excitement.  Everywhere the world was a
beautiful place.  And he enjoyed being "Five thousand miles from my home...."
And then one day he wanted to return to his home, and he found that the place
had changed.  It was not as he remembered it.  And he realized that even here
he was "Five thousand miles from my home...."

I liked this song because it had a catchy tune.  It wasn't until recently that
I listened to the words and saw my life in them.  My mother is German.  My
father, Austrian.  They met in Switzerland and now live in New Jersey.  I am
married to a Brit.  Our son has three citizenships.  I've lived in Michigan,
Germany, New Jersey, Austria and England.  My 'hometown' is Vienna, Austria,
one of the most beautiful European capitals I know.  I love it and feel strong
ties to it.  Every time I visit, I am just that, a visitor.  My relatives take
me sightseeing and introduce me to their friends as "the niece from America",
although I no longer reside in the States.  My parents are about to retire and
plan to return to Austria.  They are terrified of the changes that reshaped
this home of theirs over the last quarter of a century, and wonder if they can
cope.  I love visiting Vienna, but feel a definite pang and hurt at being
treated as a foreigner.  Wherever I am, I am accustomed to being just a little
different to my neighbours.  I don't mind it, even enjoy it a bit.  But every
once in a while, I'd like to go home.

was it "Ham and Eggs".)
