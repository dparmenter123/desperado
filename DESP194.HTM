So, Ceacescu was lifted off the roof of the Rumanian presidential palace
this morning and flown off to Iran, the Estonians, Georgians, Ukranians,
Hungarians, Bulgarians, Czechs, and just about everybody but the Chinese
are looking around and saying things could be different.  That is the big
message I get from all that's happened in Eastern Europe, that no matter
how entrenched stupid, cruel, useless policies may seem, they can disappear
in a moment.  Civilization consists of potentials.  There are concentration
camp guards out there in every country, waiting for their jobs, and their
are noble politicians also, waiting for the call.  We could don't now see
how to do it, it isn't at all clear, but we are just a hairsbreadth away
from ridding ourselves of policies, actions, and attitudes that are as
harmful to us (in smaller ways) as the stupid, evil (same thing) policies
of the communist dictatorships.  We are just a hairsbreadth away from good
schools that teach, a way of treating illness, a way of being poor or rich
that's not so destructive, a way of fighting crime without imperiling
freedom, a way of . . .

Please don't fill that ellipsis in with "a way of fulfilling the liberal
agenda", because that's not what I mean at all.  Better to fill it in with
"a way of political struggle that is creative and positive."  The trouble
with our present ways is that everybody's got a piece of the truth and
nobody's got the truth.  But we're just a hairsbreadth away.

Furthermore, in closing this "deep thought" section here, I wouldn't draw
too many ironic parallels between our quick jump into Panama and the
collapse of communism.

BEST TRUE STORY HEARD ON THE ROAD IN 1989 AWARD: to Duane Snow owner of
Street Cycles in Portland Maine.

While his staff was servicing my bike, Duane told me about the real- life
winter racing series in nearby Bath Maine.  It seems they go bored with the
long winters and devices a racing series at a local tavern.  They race BELT
SANDERS on a 25-foot wooden course. The power comes from extension cords
dangling from a moving track on the ceiling. An American-made brand,
Milwaukee, had been dominating the series last year.  However, late in the
season, some high-revving Japanese belt sanders slid into victory circle.
The Milwaukee-brand competitors (many of whom work in the shipyard's
machine shops) have worked all summer taking ounces of weight off their
racing machines and experimenting with different brands of sandpaper for
better traction. Will the high-tech Japanese machines beat the legendary
Milwaukee classics? Stop by the shipyard bar in Bath this winter, for some
real True Grit action.

&gt;
&gt;       I got the basic idea yesterday afternoon, and while working on some
&gt; code that evening, the whole story popped into my head.  It's complete
&gt; fiction; none of this is actually true (darnit).
&gt;
&gt;       I hope y'all like it.
&gt;
&gt;                                       Until I go public,
&gt;                                       Anon-7
&gt; --------
&gt;       My girlfriend always seemed to enjoy seeing just how much she could
&gt; get away with doing some form of our bondage in public.  She does this
&gt; partly because she finds it fun, mostly because she knows it drives me out
&gt; of my tree.  Usually, I'm able to fast-talk my way out of potentially
&gt; embarrassing situations with Mundanes, but yesterday she very nearly got me
&gt; fired.
&gt;
&gt;       Yesterday afternoon we had lunch together.  Afterward, she
&gt; accompanied me back to my place of work.  I thought this slightly unusual,
&gt; since she had never before expressed an interest in my work (electronic
&gt; engineering), but it didn't occur to me that she had something planned.
&gt;
&gt;       We arrived at my workbench, where I'm currently trying to figure
&gt; out why the $&amp;%@*! board on which I'm working is not performing the way I
&gt; designed it.
&gt;       "Is this where you work?" she asked.
&gt;       "At the moment," I replied.
&gt;
&gt;       I reached over to turn on the scope, thereby completely failing to
&gt; notice the huge studded black leather collar she produced from her purse.
&gt; Before I could even blink (it's amazing the speed at which she can do this),
&gt; she had locked the collar snugly around my neck, and locked the end of the
&gt; six-foot jack chain to the center of the bench (where there just happened
&gt; to be a mounting hole, dammit).  I turned to face her in utter disbelief,
&gt; mouth agape.
&gt;       "I'll be back for you at five," she said.
&gt;
&gt;       "HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY WACKO!!?!?" I yelled in a hushed voice.
&gt; "HOW THE HELL AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS???"
&gt;
&gt;       "You'll think of something," she said, dropping the keys into her
&gt; cleavage.  "You always do."
&gt;
&gt;       "But suppose I have to go to the bathroom," I countered.
&gt;
&gt;       "Don't give me that," she said.  "I've seen you go for a whole day
&gt; without visiting the bathroom."
&gt;
&gt;       "But...," I tried to say.
&gt;
&gt;       "SHHH!  The subject is closed.  I'll be back at five.  Bye."
&gt;
&gt;       She turned and left, against my hushed protests.  I sat in panic and
&gt; tried to think out my situation.  I tried to think of all the people who
&gt; might visit.  Most of my co-workers were friends who knew that my
&gt; girlfriend and I were a bit odd, so this shouldn't surprise them.  But I
&gt; had *no* idea what I was going to say if one of my bosses came in.  I
&gt; checked my watch to see how long I would have to endure this ignominy.
&gt; 13:30 (I'm a military time weenie).  "Three and a half hours," I thought.
&gt; I heaved a sigh, and got to work, such as I could.
&gt;
&gt;       As it happened, three of my co-workers visited for what-not.  All of
&gt; them immediately noticed the collar (it would be pretty hard not to), and
&gt; asked if it was my girlfriend's idea.  I said yes.  They asked what I would
&gt; say if my supervisor saw it.  I said I hadn't the faintest idea.
&gt;
&gt;       One of the aforementioned colleagues took the bench next to me, and
&gt; after a few remarks (and a question as to where he could get a collar like
&gt; the one I had), settled down to work in silence.
&gt;
&gt;       After some time, I checked my watch.  16:40.  "Gee, I just might
&gt; make it through this after all," I thought.  I was even beginning to get
&gt; a handle on the problem with the #%^*@! board on which I was working.  Murphy
&gt; must have been standing right behind me reading my thoughts, for not more
&gt; than two minutes later one of my bosses entered the room.  And not just any
&gt; boss.  Noooooooo.  This was Mr. Narrowminded himself.  This was the guy who
&gt; took Lifespring *and* became a born-again fundamentalist.  How he came to
&gt; have the power of hire-and-fire over us is one of the Great Mysteries of
&gt; The Universe.  We avoided this guy at all costs.
&gt;
&gt;       His eyes fell upon me immediately.  A few picoseconds later, he saw
&gt; the collar around my neck in all its splendor.  "My life is over," I
&gt; thought.  I still hadn't thought of a plausible explanation for this.  Mr.
&gt; Solderbrain (the name we called him behind his back; a corruption of his
&gt; real name) started to walk slowly and deliberately over to me, his eyes
&gt; fixed on the collar.  Fifteen agonizing seconds later, he was standing next
&gt; to me.  I thought the guy sitting next to me was going to have a siezure
&gt; stifling all his giggles.  I continued to work, acting as though there were
&gt; nothing the least bit unusual about my predicament.
&gt;
&gt;       Finally, he spoke.
&gt;
&gt;       "What.  The.  HELL!  Is.  That??!" he said.
&gt;
&gt;       I don't know how I thought of what I said.  In fact, I'm pretty sure
&gt; I didn't know what I was going to say until just as I was saying it.  I'm
&gt; even more amazed that Solderbrain actually bought it and didn't fire me on
&gt; the spot.
&gt;
&gt;       I turned to face him calmly, with total nonchalance, exuding
&gt; complete confidence in what I was about to say, even though I didn't know
&gt; what it was yet.  I didn't even miss a beat.
&gt;
&gt;       "Grounding strap," I said, and returned to work.
&gt;
&gt;       The guy next to me fell off his chair and nearly died laughing.

        A friend of mine had a bady last week (actually his wife did the

    Children born in the 1990s will be slimmer, shorter, and better
    proportioned then their parents, according to a report published today.
    The report in New Woman Magazine says big busts, hips and bellies will

    foods. People will also be shorter, with six-foot men becoming an

Subj:   Awright already, let's sit this cactus out.

"Cactus" *was* Greek, once upon a time.  Well, actually, as jon@apple
so pointedly points out, "KAKTWS" was Greek, barring the fuktup omega
(which is supposed to ba an omicron anyway) and sigma.  Maybe it still
is Greek, who knows, probably even Greek people don't.  But "cactus"
spelt with an initial C isn't of Greek heritage.  I quote the OED:

    Cactus (kae.ktvs).  [a. L. cactus, a. Gr. KAKTOS a prickly plant
    found in Sicily, the Cardoon or Spanish Artichoke...]

It's Latin, folks, and cacti is the correct plural because cactus is a
second declension noun.  It could also possibly have been cactUs, where
U stands for a u with a macron over it; that's fourth declension, but I
find in the New Etymological Dictionary of the English Language that
the plural is indeed cacti.  But only in Latin.  Both the OED and said
etymological treasurehouse go on to say that the English plural is
cactuses.

Now aren't you glad you asked...?

-d

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I didn't have to ask.  I already knew the plural.  But these other
ignorami, er, -uses, didn't.

I like this:

&gt;From Desperado:

        Cactus" is a word of Greek, not Latin, origin, so "cacti" is not its
        plural.  That leaves you with either "cactodes" or "cactuses".

Where did "cactodes" come from?  I can just see this guy fretting for nigh
onto 20 year:  "There's `diodes' and then Princess Di, there's `cathodes'
and my girl friend Cath, there's...".  I think Cacterine is the correct
Greek plural (on the model of tangerine and Catherine).  Another
interesting case is "backhoe", from the Greek for "hail Bacchus", whose
correct plural is also the past tense.  Are I a linguist yet?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Cactodes", well, I totally made it up, but it must have been right,
because none of the Graeco-Roman wranglers have called me on it yet.

Re the following:

    (But the singular of "insignia" is *not* "insignium", it's "insigne", which

    "cactus" and "hippopotamus" are good English (American) words and should
    get their plurals the same way as all the rest of 'em.)

Dear Dr. Grammar,

Do you therefore advocate using "stimuluses" as the plural of "stimulus"?

(Everybody else was giving you a hard time, and I felt left out.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
That's what I'm here for, Dan.  Making provocative statements and provoking
people with them.  It makes for interesting mail, which is what I'm really

may-be-formed-"correctly" codicil that I issued to my general papal bull

In a completely unexpected move today, Charles Babbage, creator of the
"Babbage Numerator", widely recognized to be the prototypical computer,
announced that he and his heirs will be suing all makers of computer
equipment, computer peripherals, computer-driven equipment (cars,
microwave ovens, etc) for royalty fees retroactive to December 1, 1880.

The basis for the suit is quoted: "All computers ever produced since mine
are unlicensed derivative works, and they infringe upon my copyright of
presentation appearance which I placed on the Numerator."

In a related news item, Ada Lovelace, Babbage's live-in girlfriend,
is filing a suit against all programmers, claiming that they have unlawfully

Subj:   Toasters and timeclocks, the other side

The McDonald's toaster/timeclock thing, with the toasters boosting the
clocks' run rate, reminds me of an electrical power stealer that a
friend designed.  He built one to prove to us all that it'd work, and
then he blew away both the unit and the schematic.  But the thing is
repeatable, if you're not worried about taking a long enforced vacation
under the sponsorship of your friendly state government.

This thing was designed to steal power from the electric utility, but
not in the way you'd expect.  It was based on the fact that if you're
generating power yourself and feeding it back into the line the utility
has to pay you for it.  (Void where prohibited.)

To use the beast, you simply plugged it into any outlet in your house.

It worked by drawing power for a very short portion of every cycle; its
control logic turned things on for only a few microseconds when the
voltage was at peak.  The duration of the draw was short enough that
the electric meter on the wall didn't get a chance to start moving.
Then, after sufficient energy was stored in a capacitor, the device
released it all back in pulses long enough to turn the reverse- supply
meter; the result was that the utility could measure the amount of
power being *supplied* from the device.

Cute, huh?

Tom:

I must inform you that I found the "Honk if you love Jesus" bumper sticker
episode in the latest Desperado to be offensive in its implication that
Christians may be particularly hostile.  All it proves is that Christians
don't necessarily remove their bumper stickers before selling their cars.

Regarding the Gospel of John, translated into Scots, am glad tae see
ya be doon some goot literature, fer a change!  Keep it up!

Regarding the famous cookie recipe, someone here at the Mill made up a
batch and brought 'em in.  They were OK, but I wouldn't have paid
$2.50, let alone 100X that for the blasted recipe!  Archway is lots
better!

I wrote him back, as indicated by the &gt; below, and he replied an eye for an
eye and a bumper sticker for a bumper sticker:

    &gt;    Or maybe Christians don't always turn the other cheek.

    As the *other* bumper sticker says:

          CHRISTIANS AREN'T PERFECT...JUST FORGIVEN.

BUT, if I eliminated everything that might offend someone, it wouldn't be
very interesting.  In DEC's notesfiles, everyone is *highly* touchy.
Except for the non-Japanese-motorcyles file, no one can say anything even
slightly rude anymore.  I prize mail for the relative equanimity of its
reading paradigm.  The true utopia has only two laws:

    Don't bother anybody.

    Don't be too easy to bother.

obscenity".  Among other things he reworded Hamlet's famous soliloquy into
modern English...

PRINCE HAMLET:

To be, or not to be:  that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?  To die:  to sleep;
No more;  and, by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd.  To die, to sleep;
To sleep:  perchance to dream:  aye, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause.

PRINCE CHARLES:

Well, frankly, the problem as I see it
At this moment in time is whether I
Should just lie down under all this hassle
And let them walk all over me.
Or, whether I should just say:  "OK
I get the message," and do myself in.
I mean, let's face it, I'm in a no-win situation,
And quite honestly, I'm so stuffed up to here with the
Whole stupid mess that, I can tell you, I've just
Got a good mind to take the quick way out.
That's the bottom line.  The only problem is:
What happens if I find that when I've bumped
Myself off, there's some kind of a, you know
All that mystical stuff about when you die,
You might find you're still - know what I mean?

Charlie doesn't like modern architecture either.

Speaking of Scotland, as we seem to be doing these days, I've been saving
the following for Hogmanay, the Scot new year.

    Horace

    Much to his mum and Dad's dismay
    Horace ate himself one day.
    He didn't stop to say his grace,
    He just sat down and ate his face.
    "We can't have this!", his Dad declared,
    "If that lad's ate, he should be shared!".
    But even as he spoke they saw
    Horace, eating more and more:
    First his lgs and then his thighs,
    His arms, his nose, his hair, his eyes...
    "Stop him someone!" Mother cried
    "Those eyeballs would be better, fried!".
    But all too late, for they were gone,
    And he had started on his dong...
    "Oh! Foolish child!" the Father mourns
    "You could have deep-fried that with prawns,
    Some parsley and some tartar sauce..."
    But H. was on his second course:
    His liver and his lights and lung,
    His ears, his neck, his chin, his tongue;
    "to think I raised him from the cot
    And now he's going to scoff the lot!"
    His mother cried: "What shall we do?
    What's left won't even make a stew..."
    And as she wept, her son was seen
    To eat his head, his heart, his spleen.
    And there he lay; a lad no more,
    Just a stomach on the floor...
    None the less, since it was his
    They ate it-that's what haggis is.*

    *No it isn'y. Ed. Haggis is a kind of stuffed black pudding eaten by
    the scots and considered them to be not only a delicacy but fit for
    human consumption. The minced heart, liver and lungs of a sheep, calf
    or other animal's inner organs are mixed with oatmeal, sealed and
    boiled in maw in the sheep's intestinal stomach-bag and....
    Excuse me a minute, Ed.

When I was working for the paper in Chicago, someone brought in a lump
wrapped in newspaper that turned out to be a haggis-filled sheep's stomach
and I ate some, without benefit of Scotch  (or "whisky" as the Scots call
it) and I liked it a lot.  But I haven't had any since, and that was 30
years ago.

Subj:   re rap

&gt; Rap goes way back.  If you use the definition of rhythmic chanting
&gt; for rap, it may be the oldest form of music.
&gt; ... As for rap being filled with boasting, what would
&gt; rock'n'roll be without boasting?

Or light opera?  :-)

Okay, I've learned to accept other people, no matter how weird
 their values seem to me.  I've learned to accept neighbors who
  engage in such dubious activities as watering their lawns and
   washing and waxing their cars every week.

But how am I supposed to be expected to accept a juniper bush
 trimmed into three stacked spheres, sprayed with fake snow,
  and dressed up like Frosty the Snowman, while Mickey Mouse and
   the Baby Jesus peer at him from behind a palm tree bedecked
    with more blinking lights than one could find in Vegas?

And we segue from that pleasant holiday thought to this less pleasant one,
a retelling of the Tiananmen Square stuff I sent out this summer, in verse.

Subj:   Not a trace

Here's a version of the Tiananamen Square article that you publishedin June
that has been turned into English half-lines.  I hope this gives a little
more dignity and weight to the biggest and saddest reversal in this year of
reversals.  As Daniel Schorr recently said, "Don't say irreversible
anymore, just be hopeful, and describe the changes in the world as 'hopeful
signs'."

Mark

Not a trace:
&amp;Tiananamen Square

&amp;We told each other    it was like this
we were  sitting together    holding hands
we were sitting     by the monument
we were sitting    where we waited in sorrow
we knew we were alive     others were not
many more   who stayed at the Square
many more    who stayed on Chang An Blvd
many more    who will never come back

&amp;Some of them were young    very  young
afterwards      we got information
afterwards     on the network the story came out
not long after    came the details of June 3

&amp;L. Peng gave three orders    after ten o'clock
He gave them       with haste
First:         soldiers could shoot
Second:    the army must move
Third:   what to do with the leaders
they are to be killed     at will

&amp;Compatriots     listen to me
these puppets    ruthless and insane
are still moving     their armies around
these rulers        out of touch with reality
have ordered     massacres of their people
these men         who surround Deng Xzo Peng
who do not      understand their people
people who have ordered      a massacre in Bejing

&amp;Some said    two hundred students died
Some said    over four thousand
The actual number    I don't know
those    on the outer edge
those    belonging to the union
those   of the autonomous workers
They were all dead    at least thirty

&amp;Now I heard    about our retreat
And you cried    at the  retreat of the students
When we heard how soldiers    arriving  in tanks
They took everything     the abandoned tents the clothing and bodies
When they had them all together    poured gasoline
over the bodies     and set the bodies on fire

&amp;Then they washed the grounds    so thoroughly
Not a trace of evidence was left    Except words

&amp;Words that spread    over the network
 while the Goddess of Liberty    our lovely symbol
was run over by a tank    broken up into small pieces

&amp;He was only fifteen     to think so much about death
I can't remember his exact words.     but I do remember
one thing he said   "Life is strange
there is only a fine line here   between life and death
Sometimes I see a worm    crawling along
When the worm moves   it gets trampled
and never moves again"

                                   Republic  please remember
this child fought for you

&amp;Between 2 and 3 am     they forced us  to abandon
our first line of defense      the public address system
we used  it to speak to you one last time      from the bottom of the steps
and when we moved up        they moved up too
 to the speaker on the monument itself    clinging to Liberty

&amp;Those of us in command     went around the monument
to comfort our fellow students       and to mobilize them
We were  stunned though          just sitting there

&amp;Some said      the first row was most determined
Others said       fellow students in the back row are just as determined
If the first row gets attacked       we will  not run

&amp; I told them a very old story  "There was an ant hill
with one billion ants    the hill was on fire one day
the ants realised      if they were to be saved
they must get through it     get through the fire
"So some of the ants held together     rolled towards the  fire
those on the outer edge  burned to death      but the rest  lived

&amp;Afterwards someone said   "Fellow students  on the square
we are standing on the outer edge of our people"
only through sacrifice we thought     we could save the republic
When  each of us understood  that       we sang the Internationale

&amp;  But in this dynasty      on that particular day
Things did not go our way
                                                  Later several compatriots
He Dejian and others     on hunger strike
Said to themselves      Can I take this
Said to others     Kids  can you  sacrifice yourselves here

&amp;  Their questions had no answer    we were determined.
Some went to seek out the army        whose job was to mop u
Some searched the Square      to find someone in charge of the clean up"
To offer to negotiate      to leave the  Square peacefully

&amp;  Some actually wanted to leave  that way   with honor
as if our safety were  guaranteed     to leave quietly
as if we could go in peace     only to retreat

&amp; At this time  our command      solicited opinions of students
They were asking     whether to stay or to leave.
And then someone decided     that we should leave.

&amp; But while we were preparing to retreat      we saw that they lied
Then it was clear     those  butchers did not keep their words.
defaced the monument     the people's monument
how could they shoot at the monument       symbol of our liberty

&amp;Soldiers in helmets      charged us  with bayonets
before we could retreat     from our podium
Then they climbed our monument     lousy Fascists
They destroyed our speaker    ended public address

&amp;  While the rest of the students retreated      we were crying and fighting.
Some citizens told us not to cry     and we said we'll be  back
I said I was sorry       because this is the people's square
You said you were not sorry    you still believed we would not be hurt
Later we learned differently       but we also learned
that some students      thought the worst case would be
that we would forcibly taken away    not disposed of.
 they were too tired      sleeping in tents
Then the tanks      made meat pies out of them

&amp; Some said      more than two hundred students had died
Some said      more than four thousand died in the square
The actual figures      I still don't know
 but there on the outer edge     all were dead
&gt;From the autonomous workers union    every last one

&amp; That was when we heard about the pyre    how they gathered it
How the soldiers  mopped up     hidden in tanks and APCs
put clothes tents and students' bodies together       made a pyre
poured gasoline over everything    set them on fire
How they washed the grounds      not a trace of evidence was left
How they roughly ran over      Democracy's symbol
Trashing  with tanks      the lovely Liberty
There we linked hands     at Chairmen Mao's Memorial Hall
Where 30&amp;,000 armed soldiers      faced us to the west
How many students cried Dogs, fascists   how many fought

&amp;  The soldiers were headingout   marching towards Tiananmen
We passed Liubuko     passed members of our command
We were in the first row     Us their words tell
What they saw     what they didn't see

&amp; Liubuko
&amp; On the afternoon of June 3 at Liubuko     one of the first battle sites
bloody  derbris  was everywhere         trash cans burned out
We went on    from Liubuko to Chang An Blvd
We saw  a lot       burned out vehicles and broken cobble stones
Obviously      a fierce and bloody battle had been fought
Obviously     there was no bodies in view

&amp;Meanwhile    We were marching back to the Square.
Some citizens of Beijing     tried to turn us away.
They asked us    Kids, do you know  they have machine guns  set up
And they said  Don't sacrifice yourselves
We then left through Xidan     to retreat to our campus
On the way back     we saw a mother crying because her kid was dead
A body killed by soldiers      lying on the street
Then the reports came      over the network

&amp;Continually     I received reports of people shot
I heard about citizens killed    who commited no crimes
I heard about citizens killed   who didn't even shout slogans
In spite of reports     perhaps we didn't listen well enough
Could not believe    so few could change the path for so many
Could not reverse    the tide of so many voices in our ears
But their dam     held that day
Held in that dynasty    despite a fire on the edge of an anthill
That burned on that day    the rest have become
characters to be reckoned with some day       now statistics
Read on wall posters     read between lines

&amp; More details later   still later we learned
How the fascists were crazed with machine guns    mowed people down
how the soldiers    who came from the back
would pick up the bodies     put them on buses or trolleys
how some of the people might still be alive    when picked up
how others must have suffocated      people among bodies
Not a trace     we saw
