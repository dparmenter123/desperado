Subj:   So you like to hear about sparks?

I worked years ago in a large hospital in Springfield, Ma, as their electrical
engineer.  They were finally getting around to replacing an antiquated
electrical system, a hodgepodge of new circuit breaker panels and wiring mixed
with old slate panels using knife switches and cartridge fuses.  This
hospital dated back to the 1880s where, before the advent of electric
lighting, my office had been an operating room.  Platforms on the roof were
used to hold gas lights which shone in through the windows so they could
operate at night with flammable anesthetics.

My job was to survey the existing electrical load so we could plan with the
architect what the new service and distribution would be.  I descended into
the subterranian tunnels of the hospital and into the vault, way under the
road, where some relatively recent equipment distributed power to the ten
building complex.  This room had two rows of floor to ceiling cabinets facing
each other.  On the left were manual transfer switches allowing loads to be
switched to the emergency generator, and on the right were banks of large
circuit breakers distributing power to the switches, and to buildings and
panels throughout the hospital.

As you enter the room, turn on the light and the door closes behind, there is
a ringing in your ears from the silence; but it is not completely quiet.
You become aware of a prominent 60 cycle hum.  It does not come from
transformers, there are none in here.  The sound is from the movement of the
conductors as the current throbs through the busbars and cables.

The plan of attack was to go behind the circuit breaker cabinets where there
was a narrow aisle, unbolt and open up the back of the cabinets which were
hinged to one side.  Inside is a jungle jim array of busbars up to six inches
wide for as much as 2000 amps feeding the backs of the circuit breakers from
which thick cables leave to feed the loads.  Measurements are made with an
amprobe, a meter on a handle whose end is a large claw which can be closed
around the conductors.  I need to reach in at arm's length past the busbars,
clamp around the cables, and read the meter.

The voltage, up to 240 volts, is something I am rather used to, but the
current is something else.  I am vaguely aware of what the short circuit of a
two thousand amp bus would be like. Normal household circuits run up to 20
amps and I have crossed them with a screwdriver before, leaving me with a
shorter screwdriver.  Electric welding is done in the neighborhood of 200
amps.  If I were faced with a fault at 2000 amps (or probably five to ten
times that during a short), the result would be lakes of molten copper and
steam (me).

It is my second day at this.  The first day I made a few measurements and
I feel a little more comfortable at the job, maybe a little too confident.  I
open up the cabinet, begin to reach in and ZAP.  An explosion, arcs, a bright
shower of sparks...and darkness closes in.

As I begin to understand what is going on around, I feel no pain, only
weakness.  But still darkness.  My heart is pounding, my arms and legs are
shaking.  I realize I am still standing.  I back away, feeling along the wall
to the door, and as I open it, I can see.  I realize I have gotten away
totally unhurt, once my nerves recover, that is.

Going back in with a flashlight, I found that the steel panel swung back as I
opened it into a lighbulb on the wall, breaking it off, and continuing to swing
into the filament support wires leaving weld spots on the panel.  A
replacement bulb and reset circuit breaker fixed everything up.  I took a
coffee break before the next measurement.

I always say my dad was an electrical engineer when you could still get
electrocuted doing it.  You too, I guess.  He trained himself not to jump
when he got a shock, on the theory that what he jumped into might be worse
than what he was jumping away from.  The smell of ozone always reminds me
of him.

Here's a handwriting analyst on Marla Maples' handwriting,
 according to the latest _Newsweek_:

        Marla possesses an abundance of charm---and even more
        important to her male quarry, her underscoring of words
        and frequent exclamation points reveals that she is
        primed for romance, ready for love and caresses.

Is the underscoring for romance, and the exclamation points for
 love and caresses?  Or vice-versa?  What I want to know is,
  does she dot her I's with little hearts?
   &lt;_Jym!!!!!!!!!_&gt;

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Half of Jym's correspondents &lt;emphasis&gt;(did not know) who Marla Maples
was!  This Georgia cutie with large arms (and a correspondingly large
arm-protector) is or was Donald Trump's secondary squeeze.

A poignant item in the Boston Herald this week:  An affidavit from a woman
being threatened by here husband, reprinted because her husband had finally
killed her.  When she signed her name, she dotted the I with a sad face.

When I was reporting in Chicago, one of my rivals took Richard Speck's
signature to a graphoanalyst's convention.  The analysts concluded that
anyone with such a signature was prone to violence.  One of them had the
cojones to suggest that this impulse might be directed against medical
personnel.

I have Speck's autograph myself.

I was covering the criminal courts of of Cook County at the time for
Chicago's most crime-minded daily and the Speck trial was our biggest
story.  Speck was a pretty ordinary yokel  and drifter who had just
happened to kill eight young women all at once.

My paper had a photographer assigned full time to Criminal Courts, a real
old-timer with the hat on the back of the head and a Speed Graphic (but
no, we didn't put our press cards in our hatbands, but I wore a derby
anyway).

When Speck was brought into court for arraignment, my photographer yelled
out to him, "Look at the top of my bald head!"  The next morning, all over
the world, newspapers featured a picture of Richard Speck and the sheriff's
bailiff both grinning like crazy.

Another time, all us newshounds were hanging around the Public Defender's
office.  He was Speck's lawyer.  Two people came in the door and my
photographer instinctively took their pic.  It turned out that they were
Speck's aunt and uncle and we had an exclusive shot of them.  "I knew they
were from out of town when I saw the white socks," my photographer
explained.

At one point, just before the real trial, the prosecutor's "accidentally"
left a room next door to the press room open.  Inside was a model of the
townhouse where the nurses were murdered.  It is emblematic of my problems
with being a reporter that building such a model seemed normal and
sensible to me and I didn't see any story in it at all.  So, I got
scooped.

Another time, the Chicago Sun-Times got a story on some motion or other
that the Public Defender had made onSpeck's behalf.  They were a morning
paper and we (Chicago's American) were an afternoon, so I still had a
chance to recover.  I stormed downstairs to the PD's office and demanded
to see him.  His receptionist said I couldn't.  I insisted.  She said no.
I walked through the swinging gate in the railing (just like in all those
old movies).  She jumped up and stood in front of the door, defending it
against me.  She was a foot shorter than I was so I just pounded on the
door over her head until the PD opened it and I yelled, "You gave Steve
that story and you didn't give it to me!  Give it to me now!"  He was so
startled he rummaged through a file on his desk and gave me his own copy
of the motion, signed by the defendant, which I still have.

Those who know me now can hardly believe I was such a non-mild-mannered
reporter, but there you are.  I was hot to get the story, that day anyway.

Subj:   How you got Richard Speck's autograph

I knew a guy who, in the course of researching a book on mass murderers,
got to know Speck pretty well.  Speck wound up sending him a wedding
card when the guy got married.  The prison gift shoppe carried must've
carried a complete Hallmark line.

Network Working Group                                        D. Waitzman
Request for Comments: 1149                                       BBN STC
                                                            1 April 1990

   A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers

Status of this Memo

   This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of
   IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily
   useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not
   recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Overview and Rational

   Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
   altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
   point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
   but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
   each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
   space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
   IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
   system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
   technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
   line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
   some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.

Frame Format

   The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
   hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
   The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
   A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
   bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
   paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
   typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.

   Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
   datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
   form.

Discussion

   Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
   order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
   eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
   of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-
    regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause
   data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier
   drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be
   found on logs and cable trays.

Security Considerations

   Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
   measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
   are used in a tactical environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;    What do we do about people who have the attitude that it's
&gt;    ok to use more paper now that we're recycling?

          When I was in Littleton, there was a forum about security.
        The guy who was giving the talk told us that, even though we
        don't allow the password on the SYSTEM account to be
        MANAGER, some people still set it to be that, knowing full
        well that it's about the least secure username/password
        combo in the world.

          As he put it, "If somebody wants to be agressively stupid,
        there's not much you can do about it."

        I've found that to apply to many situations...

Subj:   learning Japanese from late-nite TV

Bonsai  - little trees  (lit. to plant in a tray)
Banzai  - Hip, hip hoorah! or something   (lit. 10,000 years old)

And now we have, on late night TV:

Bonzai knives!

According to the Japanese-English dictionary, bonzai means either:

one's legal wife      or     ordinary ability, mediocre

An unfortunate name for a knife company, I'd say.  On the other hand, at least
it's a word, which is more than you can say for Bonzai's better-known
competitor, Ginsu knives. "Ginsu" doesn't mean anything at all.

You'd think these joints would spend an hour or so researching their names.

Even the pompous Boston Globe can't get it right, their article about rising
real estate prices in Japan saying "the Japanese call it 'kyora', madness".
Which wouldn't matter if they hadn't tried to tell us exactly what THEY call
it. Well, of course there's no such word. "Kyouran" or even "kyoran" would do,
but kyora, like ginsu, means nothing.

The Japanese call it 'namakemono', laziness.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
                        !!Gross-out warning!!
I just read a book about a murder in Detroit in which a Ginsu knife played
a big part.  Two low-life junkies, a prostitute and her boyfriend, see the
Ginsu commercial on TV.  He doesn't believe you can cut a beer can and
then slice a tomato.  She says oh yes you can and we even have a Ginsu.
She gets tomato, beer can and Ginsu and does the experiment.  Later that
day, they kill this psychologist who they've been ripping off and cut him
up to get rid of the body, using the Ginsu.  The pathologist can't believe
that the same tool was used stab him and to cut both the flesh and the
bones because everything's so smooth.

Subj:   desperado submission

        My neighbor and I attended an American Cancer Society Benefit
        in Lewiston, ME, March 30-April 1. Very apropos for April
        Fool's Day! The following is an article we wrote and submitted to
        a local newspaper

        American Cancer Society Benefit a Success: Soitenly!!

        The finer things of life begin as a lark or an accident, like seeing
        a not-so-innocent ASK THE GLOBE question about whether there would be
        a Three Stooges Festival this year. "Soitenly" came the response. As
        my neighbor Jack and I always search for the "socially redeeming
        value" aspect of life, we could not resist such an opportunity into
        the hinterlands of Lewiston, ME to rediscover a classical piece of
        Americana.

        As we set off Friday afternoon, things were not boding well, with
        the weather showing signs of rambunctiousness. Would the weather make
        us victims of soicumstance? We checked in at the motel 5:00 PM in
        Auburn ready for the big time.

        "How do I get to the Ramada Inn in Lewiston?" I naively asked the
        receptionist.

        "Oh, the THREE STOOGES FESTIVAL!!" she devilishly smirked, while
        she seemed to want to say, "Nyukk, Nyukk Nyukk!" PULEASE,
        NOT so LOUD!!! She quickly handed me a zeroxed sheet of street
        directions. "Must be the big show in town," I thought.

        Jack and I saw the first signs of nirvana Friday evening: beer,
        pretzels and an endless stream of Three Stooges antics and slapstick.
        The sponsor of the show, the American Cancer Society, would not make it
        easy for us: two rooms for the films, one for Curley Specials, the
        other for Shemps. Talk about a moral dilemma! Many of us resigned
        ourselves to more beer and pretzels, as even Stooge aficionados do
        not have the gift of bilocation!

        The small theatre was crammed. Ever so often a fan would come in and
        accidently (?) trip on the stairs, much to the delight and cheers of
        of us all. Moe, Curley and Larry had not forgotten us in spirit!
        Does life get any better? Four hours later, I said to Jack, "What
        does your watch say?" "Tick, tick, tick, tick" he replied. Time to get
        back to our room. This time we really were victims of soicumstance!
        We got lost in Lewiston. Jack had the diplomacy not to call this pretend
        navigator a knucklehead!

        Raw weather and 4 inches of snow later did not prevent a long line
        of avowed "imbeciles" waiting to get in Saturday morning. Strains
        of Three Blind Mice were in the air. People from MA, PA, Tennessee and
        NH came to pay homage, beat the film scripts to the punch line and
        walk around in Three Stooges suspenders. Dealers were hawking every-
        thing from Moe's cancelled checks to videos, dolls, buttons and Stooge
        note paper. Had we died and gone to heaven? There were available member-
        ships in the Three Stooges Fan Club, card collections, doughnut eating
        contests, pie throwing with Dave "the man who would be Curley" Knight
        goading on the pie throwers: "I'm fat and you're ugly, but I can lose
        weight tomorrow. Nyukk, Nyukk, Nyukk!!"

        Paul Howard hosted an hour collage of personal 8 millimeter films and
        slides, talking affectionately of "the other side of my father" Moe.
        More films, the shorts, home movies taken by members of the Howard
        families. There was a special autographing session with Paul Howard,
        Moe's son: Jamie Howard Hanky, Curley's daughter; and Lyla Fine Budnick,
        Larry Fine's Sister, all very much into what this meant to over 2000
        attendees. The Saturday evening banquet featured the antics of
        Dave Knight with his impersonation of Curley. His performance
        moidered us quite well, thank you. A waitress tripped and dropped
        an entire tray of dishes. The crowd did not fail to appreciate
        spontaneous humor with a round of applause!! An auction raised
        more money for the Cancer Society. A ceramic mug made by Moe went
        for $500! Press kits quickly became collectors' items. And Dave
        boasted, "I think we are at about $5000 now! Not bad for a bunch of
        imbeciles!!! Nyukk, Nyukk!!" The loud cheers and applause confirmed
        our hearty agreement.

        The evening was not without ironic twists: Paul Howard was greatful
        for the sponsorship of the American Cancer Society. Moe had himself
        died of cancer from smoking. And this convention was being held in
        the only continental state where the Stooges had not performed on the
        circuit.

        Jack and I had to hit the road again at 8:30. But the Jack and Joe
        road show has promise: A Three Stooges Festival in July in
        Philadelphia, Akron in September. The American Cancer Society realized
        over $12,000 for their effort. We knuckleheads and imbeciles travelled

top ten reasons for having a VMS system:

10.  There's a long list of arguments for it
9.   Less haste!  More Filling!
8.   You could sure do worse
7.   It only seems hard to use
6.   It's a way to stay out of the ATT vs OSF fight
5.   It's RSX and, Oh! so much more!
4.   It gives you job security through cluster availability
3.   Because there's a new user born every minute.
2.   SMP means all your CPUs crash together
... and the number 1 reason for having a VMS system (insert freeze-dried
drumroll here):
&lt;FF&gt;
1.   It gives you freedom from choice, and that's what you want.

VMS is like a Soviet railroad train.  It's basically industrial-strength, but
when you look at it closely, everything's a little more shabby than you might
like.  It gets the job done, but there's no grace to it.

The Mac operating system is like the monorail at Disney World.  It's kind of
spectacular and fun, but it doesn't go much of anywhere. Still, the kids like
it.

Unix is like the maritime transit system in an impoverished country. The
ferryboats are dangerous as hell, offer no protection from the weather and leak
like sieves.  Every monsoon season a couple of them capsize and drown all the
passengers, but people still line up for them and crowd aboard.

Subj:   Pant, pant

My wife, who reads a lot about costume history, confirms that
whichever specific story you believe, the point is that "pants"
developed from a two-piece garment, one for each leg, hence the plural
usage.  However, I looked at some of her mail-order catalogs, and
found that the authors of the descriptions have been using "pant",
singular, to describe single items of clothing that anyone might call
"a pair of pants".  Just another reminder that linguistic evolution,
like biological evolution, has no preferred direction; it adapts to
local conditions.

Now should we talk about whether "agenda" is still the plural of
"agendum", or should we call the whole thing off?

        On a similar note: the town of Lake Los-Angeles CA. is voting
        on whether to change its name since it has no lake, and is 100
        miles from Los-Angeles. Even if they change the name of the town,
        They will still be in Antelope County which, of course, has no
        antelope!

Sorry, there is no "Antelope County".  Lake Los Angeles is in the Antelope
Valley.  (I should know: I'm a native of the Valley.)

There used to be lots of pronghorns in the valley; pronghorns are commonly
mistaken  for antelopes.  They all died out; out-in-the-sticks myths about
this abound. Someone in the valley had sometime in the past decade
successfully imported one or two from another state (Wyoming?) with some
difficulty...it's evidentally a lot easier to convince a state that you
want to go there to shoot a wild critter than you want to export it.

The real mistaken name in the Antelope Valley is Palmdale.  It was named
for the abundant "palm trees", which in this case are really Joshua trees.
And they only look like palm trees if you're very confused.

        Regarding Mark Berman's comment about Springfield, Massachusetts
    gaining a Harbormaster in Desperado 2028 not being possible due to
    there being no harbor in Springfield, this is incorrect.  The Western
    Mass. city of Springfield (yes, there is life beyond Route 128 - a
    Boston "joke" of sorts for those beyond New England), while not di-
    rectly next to any ocean, is bordered by the Connecticut River,
    which creates the dividing line between Vermont and New Hampshire,
    as well as cutting through Massachusetts and Connecticut into the
    Atlantic Ocean.  Springfield *does* have harbors as a result of
    this, and therefore a Harbormaster is not an absurd concept.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
It looks kind of tenditious on the map, and I think Mark lives a bit
further down the so-called Pioneer Valley from Springfield, so he may
actually know what he's talking about (not that we expect that of anyone).
On the other hand, Houston managed to turn itself into a port, even though
you have to steam past four other legitimate ports and about 40 miles of
ship canal to get there from the Gulf.

    Hi, Tom.

    I just couldn't let this one go by.  In Desperado 2028, Peter Grace not
    only uses the wrong word, but the wrong form.  `Feces' is a plural; the
    singular is `faex.'  So Sybil might have been feces (I'll make no
    value-judgements here), but each individual is usually only a faex.
    Unless it's managed to overcome the condition.  Not that there's anything
    wrong with being only a faex; some of my best friends..  It takes a
    supreme effort, or possibly a glandular condition, to become feces, so we
    should live and learn from those examples around us.  The singularity (or
    plurality) of Dan Quayle is left as an exercise for the reader.  When you
    recall the colloquial identity between a singularity and a black hole, the
    mind boggles at the ramifications of Mr Quayle as our Vice President.

    Desperately yours..

  I heard the following [possibly apocryphal] story from a friend who
  was an electronic tech at Los Alamos (and similar stories from inside
  DEC where I was working.)

  Apparently the SBC (Falcon Single Board Computer 11/21) wasn't too popular
  and Los Alamos bought a peck of 'em 'cause they were cheap. No real idea
  what to do with 'em until one day...

  In the mountains of northern New Mexico, near the Jemez Pueblo, is a
  *huge* old volcanic caldera named Valle Grande. It hasn't erupted in a
  while but it's still sitting on top of a lot of hot rock. Needless to say,
  it only took a few years before some bright engineer up at the labs
  figured out that if you drilled two holes *real* close to each other you
  could pump water into one of them and use the steam coming out of the other
  one to generate power (heat, pressure, whatever.) The only problem was that
  no one had ever done anything quite like it before and they needed better
  data (Wait, you're getting ahead of me here...)

  So for some reason which is lost forever in the mists of antiquity, they
  decided that instead of sending the data *up* from the bottom of the borehole,
  and then process it, they'd send the processor *down* into the hole. So they
  rigged up these SBCs to send back the processed data, attached 'em to the
  end of a long pipe and stuck them into the borehole 'til they fried. Yanked
  'em out and put in another one. Cheap, easy to put together. And they
  looked *neat* when you finally got them out (or so said my friend.)

And, finally, this has been kicking around in one form or another for either
two years or 23 years, so what's one more forward, even if you've seen it?  It's
the last item, so it's easy to delete.

Next ish:  Animadversions on record labelling, including a non-negotiable
demand for *more* labelling.  PLUS:

        More French undies (oo la la)
        How to rob a bank (There sure were a lot of murders THIS ish!)
        Opsys bashing continued.
        Earthquake rule of thumb.
        More fun with bic lighters.

Did I ask this before, someone sent me an explanation of why Internet
headers are like chicken guts, but I'm damned if I can find it in my
honeycombed network of subdirectories and mail folders.  Send it again.

Meanwhile, I'm off to the woods for the spring camping trip.  Maybe I'll
tell you about that in the next ish too.

        _A Humid Recital Stirs Bangkok_

(from the Washington Post, 23 July 1967)

    (This review, by Kenneth Langbell, appeared in the English language
Bangkok Post. It was made available by Martin Bernheimer of the Los Angeles
Times.)

    THE RECITAL last evening in the chamber music room of the Erewan Hotel by
U.S. pianist Myron Kropp, the first appearance of Mr. Kropp in Bangkok, can
only be described by this reviewer and those who witnessed Mr. Kropp's
performance as one of the most interesting experiences in a long time.
    A hush fell over the room as Mr. Kropp appeared from the right of the
stage, attired in black formal evening-wear with a small, white poppy in his
lapel.  With sparse, sandy hair, a sallow complexion and a deceptively frail
looking frame, the man who has repopularized Johann Sebastian Bach approached
the Baldwin Concert Grand, bowed to the audience and placed himself upon the
stool.
    It might be appropriate to insert at this juncture that many pianists,
including Mr. Kropp, prefer a bench, maintaining that on a screw-type stool
they sometimes find themselves turning sideways during a particularly
expressive strain.  There was a slight delay, in fact, as Mr. Kropp left the
stage briefly, apparently in search of a bench, but returned when informed
there was none.

    AS I HAVE mentioned on several other occasions, the Baldwin Concert Grand,
while basically a fine instrument, needs constant attention, particularly in
a climate such as Bangkok.  This is even more true when the instrument is as
old as the one provided in the chamber music room of the Erewan Hotel. In this
humudity the felts which separate the white keys from the black tend to swell,
causing an occasional key to stick, which apparently was the case last evening
with the D in the second octave.
    During the "raging storm" section of the D-Minor Toccata and Fugue, Mr.
Kropp must be complimented for putting up with the awkward D.  However, by the
time the "storm" was past and he had gotten into the Prelude and Fugue in D
Major, in which the second octave D plays a major role, Mr. Kropp's patience
was wearing thin.
    Some who attended the performance later questioned whether the awkward key
justified some of the language which was heard coming from the stage during
softer passages of the fugue.  However, one member of the audience, who had
sent his children out of the room by the midway point of the fugue, had a
valid point when he commented over the music and extemporaneous remarks of Mr.
Kropp that the workman who greased the stool might have done better to use
some of the grease on the second octave D.  Indeed, Mr. Kropp's stool had more
than enough grease, and during one passage in which the music and lyrics both
were particularly violent Mr. Kropp was turned completely around.  Whereas
before his remarks had been aimed largely at the piano and were therefore
somewhat muted, to his surprise and that of those in the chamber music room he
found himself addressing himself directly to the audience.

    BUT SUCH THINGS do happen, and the person who began to laugh deserves to
be severely reprimanded for this undignified behavior. Unfortunately, laughter
is contagious, and by the time it had subsided and the audience had regained
its composure Mr. Kropp appeared to be somewhat shaken.  Nevertheless he
swiveled himself back into position facing the piano and, leaving the D-Major
Fugue unfinished, commenced on the Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor.
    Why the concert grand piano's G key in the third octave chose that
particular time to begin sticking I hesitate to guess.  However, it is
certainly safe to say that Mr. Kropp himself did nothing to help matters when
he began using his feet to kick the lower portion of the piano instead of
operating the pedals as is generally done.
    Possibly it was this jarring, or the un-Bach-like hammering to which the
sticking keyboard was being subjected. Something caused the right front leg of
the piano to buckle slightly inward, leaving the entire instrument listing at
approximately a 35-degree angle from that which is normal. A gasp went up from
the audience, for if the piano had actually fallen several of Mr. Kropp's
toes, if not both his feet, would surely have been broken.
    It was with a sight of relief, therefore, that the audience saw Mr. Kropp
slowly rise from the stool and leave the stage. A few men in the back of the
room began clapping, and when Mr. Kropp reappeared a moment later it seemed
he was responding to the ovation. Apparently, however, he had left to get the
red-handled fire ax which was hung back stage in case of fire, for that was
what he had in his hand.

    MY FIRST REACTION at seeing Mr. Kropp begin to chop at the left leg of the
grand piano was that he was attempting to make it tilt at hte same angle as
the right leg and thereby correct the list.  However, when the weakened legs
finally collapsed altogether and Mr. Kropp continued to chop, it became
obvious to all that he had no intention of going on with the concert.
    The ushers, who had heard the snapping of piano wires and splintering of
sounding board from the dining room, came rushing in and, with the help of the
hotel manager, two Indian watchmen and a passing police corporal, finally
succeeded in disarming Mr. Kropp and dragging him off the stage.
