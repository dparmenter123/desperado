    There was this chap interviewed on Fox TV's extremely classy "A Current
    Affair" last night.  He'd been sitting in a Denny's eating swill with
    his son when he noticed lots of coppers around.

    "I thought maybe something was going down, so I took my son and left."
    This was in Florida, where things are always going down.

    The next day he found out the police had been alerted to come to
    Denny's because Col. Moammar Gaddafi was there with "a white child".  He
    also found out that it was really him.  He does look something like
    Gaddafi.  He had once been thrown off a plane for "looking like a
    terrorist".

    Our Fox journalist asked him if he'd ever considered growing a
    mustache.

    "Yeah, a lot of my friends suggested that and I did, but then I looked
    like Gabe Kaplan."

Subj:   Speaking of messing with a free press...

My daughter is the editor-in-chief of the Plymouth (NH) State College
student newspaper, The Clock.  Last week's Clock published an article
under this headline:

                        Lambda Chi songs censured

(Well, actually, they used Greek characters, but this terminal never
met Aristotle.)

It seems that a Lambda pledge left a copy of his pledge songs just
lying around where his roommate could stumble over it.  (Truth - I know
the people involved.)  The roommate was offended by what he found,
namely some truly crude and appallingly sexist drivel; so he xeroxed
the songs and took his copy to the Dean of Women.  The next step was
official censure of the Lambda house, which is already on probation.
(This Lambda house isn't affiliated with the Lambda Chi national
organization.)

And then the paper broke the story.

So.  About messing with a free press?  The Lambdas followed the van
that distributed bundles of the paper and just *picked up the bundles*
as they were left.  Naughty, boys, very naughty.  There is already a
precedent for criminal proceedings against people who do that sort of
thing; and the Clock, on sound legal advice, is pressing charges.

Salmon Rushdie, move over.  The roommate who found the songs has
received death threats.

This is a real answer to a TOPS-10 SPR:

Thank you for your SPR.  The problem actually began with SPR
30591  (see  15-Aug-81  Dispatch P3-63).  At one time it was
believed that this problem would be solved by MCO 9623  (PCO
10-701-104).   We  no  longer  believe this to be true.  MCO
9623 does not solve this  problem,  and  the  MCO  has  been
retracted.  The problem is, instead, corrected by MCO 10171.
Nevertheless, the code published on 15-Aug-81  was  not  the
correct  code for MCO 9623.  It was instead the code for MCO
9652.  Note that MCO 9652 has since been superseded  by  MCO
10038.

When we realized what  had  happened,  we  immediately  took
corrective   actions   (see   SPR  31870).   MCO  9623  (PCO
10-701-104)  was  republished  in  the  15-Feb-82   Dispatch
(P3-35).   Unfortunately,  the  code published was still not
the correct code for MCO 9623.  It was instead a fragment of
MCO 9465.  Moreover, the fragment was published incorrectly.

MCO 9465 was distributed, in its correct form, as a DDT file
to  be  used with the new release of RMS.  MCO 9465 was also
published in the 15-Mar-82 Dispatch (P3-89).   However,  the
code  was  not  labeled  correctly in that publication.  The
code labeled as MCO 9464 is actually  MCO  9465.   The  code
labeled  as  MCO  9465  is  actually  MCO  9464.  (i.e., PCO
10-701-234 is MCO 9465 and PCO 10-701-235 is MCO 9464.)

PCO 10-701-104  has  since  superseded  by  PCO  10-701-248.
Unfortunately,  it still does not depict MCO 9623 correctly.
It merely corrects the typo in  the  15-Feb-82  publication.
Thus  PCO 10-701-248 is still merely a fragment of MCO 9465.
Note  that  MCO  9465  (PCO  10-701-234)  has   since   been
superseded by MCO 10133.

In summary, the correct code for MCO  9623  has  never  been
published.  Moreover, the MCO has been retracted.  If you've
installed any of the code that purports to be  MCO  9623  we
suggest that you remove it immediately.  If you've installed
MCO 9465 (PCO 10-701-234) we  suggest  that  you  remove  it
immediately  and  replace  it  with  MCO  10133.   If you've
installed MCO 9652 we suggest that you remove it immediately
and  replace it with MCO 10038.  If you are experiencing the
original problem (TW hangs),  we  suggest  you  install  MCO
10171.

We apologize for all the confusion.

       around with this white thing in it's mouth.  He went outside
       and discovered that it was the neighbor's rabbit. Horrified
       he took the rabbit from the dog only to find that it was too
       late.   Thinking quickly he brought the rabbit into the house
       to clean it, even using the blow drier to make it nice and
       fluffy.  Then he snuck over to the neighbors,  placed the
       rabbit back in it's cage and hoped for the best.  Later in
       the day feeling guilty he went next door to confess but the
       neighbor told him this instead, "Something weird happened
       today, our rabbit died on Good Friday and this morning
       (EASTER) we found it back in it's cage...".

Subj:   Interesting Article

                      "BAD DREAM: IN HIS OWN IMAGE"

              "LOTUS has always reflected the personality of its CEO.
               Now the company is struggling, and so is Jim Manzi."

  "... Manzi is one of American business' remarkable success stories.
   A former newspaper reporter and a consultant, he didn't have a day of
   management experience when [Mitch] Kapor hired him, at the age of 31,
   as Lotus' director of marketing. Three years later, Kapor stunned his
   employees by resigning from Lotus -- then the world's largest software
   firm -- because he was unhappy running a big company. Manzi, by then
   president, was granted the titles of chairman and chief executive as well
   -- a triple crown that pays him royally. In 1987 he earned, in salary,
   bonuses, and stock options, more than $ 26M, making him the country's
   second-highest-paid executive of a publically held company. He is 37.

   Unlike Kapor ... Manzi keeps to himself. Once referred to as 'Boston's
   own Howard Hughes,' he detests small talk and prefers his encounters brief
   ... Manzi is reserved even with his top executives; he has been known to
   avoid them during business trips by taking different flights.

   ... In the last year ... a slowdown in growth, a series of product delays,
   and an exodus of top executives have given Lotus the image of a company
   under siege. Suddenly, Manzi and his paycheck began to attarct attention.
   Business Week put him on its cover last spring and ranked him fourth on
   its list of CEOs whose fat salaries were disproportionate to shareholders'
   returns. The Wall Street Journal reported in ... 'Trouble in Lotusland'
   [that] Manzi's 'sarcastic and smart alecky' manner was one of the causes.

   ... Manzi's entrenchment might have been taken as comforting news during
   Lotus' adolescence, when the company's foremost problem was managing its
   staggering growth. Since 1-2-3 debuted, Lotus has sold more than four
   million copies at $ 495 list... But two years after Mitch Kapor's departure,
   Lotus has lost its spot as the world's largest software company to its
   archrival, the Microsoft Corporation ... Three times Lotus has missed the
   delivery date for the new version [of 1-2-3], Release 3 ... Last spring
   the SEC looked into Manzi's sale of 250,000 shares of Lotus stock just
   weeks before the company announced a delay that sent the stock plummeting
   ... Recently a shareholders' suit has been filed against Lotus ...
   Interviews with more than 50 current and former Lotus employees, including
   many top corporate officers, suggest there are grave doubts about whether
   Jim Manzi is really the best man to lead Lotus when the company's survival
   is at stake.

   As with all legends, there is some truth [to that of Lotus]...
   In October, 1982, [Kapor unveiled] 1-2-3 at a press conference at the
   World Trade Center in New York... Cash poured into Lotus. Kapor had
   predicted that his company would do $ 3M in sales during its first year
   ... but he was off by $ 50M. Lotus went public [16 months later],
   raising [another] $ 41M and turning many of its original employees
   into instant millionaires ... By the time Kapor left Lotus and sold all
   his stock, he had made an estimated $ 100M.

   Kapor also carefully nurtured Lotus' image as a progressive and
   unorthodox company. He treated employees to high salaries, generous
   benefits, stock purchase plans, and picnics at Fenway Park ... [first
   employee] Janet Axelrod even kept a picture of Fidel Castro on her wall
   ... [Kapor kept a lovable image by hiring] Manzi to do everything he was
   unable or unwilling to do himself... This often meant delivering the bad
   news while Kapor delivered only the good.

   ... Above all a strategist, Manzi developed techniques that are now
   software industry standards [such as] spending millions on advertising
   campaigns that ran in mainstream business publications, not arcane
   technical journals ... Over time, Lotus became less a software development
   company and more a service firm taking care of its four million customers.
   Around the halls there were fewer engineers in jeans and flannel shirts and
   a lot more heavy-hitting sales and marketing types from companies like
   Proctor and Gamble and IBM.

   ... Beset by conflicts, and mindful of the unceremonious exit of Steven
   Jobs from his Apple Computer ... Kapor resigned. He is now happily
   ensconced as chairman of ON Technology ... But the legend of an easy
   transfer of power from Kapor to Manzi is misleading ... Manzi quickly
   replaced all but one of Kapor's inner group with managers of his own.
   As Manzi's people came to dominate senior management, members of the old
   guard were ignored or pushed out ... but by the time Kapor left, his
   relationship with Manzi had turned sour. Lotus' rarest asset -- its
   culture -- was no longer a reflection of Kapor's personality, but of
   Manzi's.

   ... The software industry, which began only a decade ago with the release
   of the Apple II computer, is young enough that its leaders enjoy a
   comaraderie ... but Manzi does not participate ... he is privately
   contemptuous of his rivals, particluarly Microsoft's William Gates ...

   ... Manzi has gone through six public relations heads since he took
   over. 'If you embarrassed Jim in any way,' says one, 'you were
   dead meat' ... When it came to his staff, Manzi was either 'ecstatic'
   with their work or called them 'dickheads' ... Frank King is the is
   the fifth software manager Manzi has had in less than four years ...
   under Manzi, change has been severe.

   Manzi is not only extreme in his opinions of his executives, but he also
   deals with them in extreme ways ... [says one manager], 'Each morning
   I would read the papers wondering if I still had a job' ... around Lotus
   employees sometimes stiffen at Manzi's approach, and he has developed a
   reputation for enjoying it... He has been known to vanish from his office
   when the annual report, which lists executive compensation, is released,
   and he fumes over comparisons between him and Kapor...

   ... Since the company went public, [Manzi] has already made $ 32M, and
   his stock holdings at today's prices are worth another $ 27M ... the
   directors even reimbursed Manzi for $ 186,000 in personal income taxes he
   owed ... Manzi insisted that Lotus' treasurer, Robert Langer, should have
   taken care of it for him, although Langer was of a different opinion ...
   after the treasurer disagreed with Manzi, he was out the door. With Manzi,
   all encounters are zero sum.

   ... The company is today precisely what it was six years ago -- a top-down
   corporation that takes its personality from its CEO. In Manzi's case, this
   has meant a company where few can find balance or stability, where
   politics have hobbled software development, where cronyism and the gilding
   of the CEO's pockets have demoralized employees, and where Manzi's need
   for absolute control has turned Lotus into a fearful place ... "

Strip to your underwear, if you're not in black tie.  Get obscene, if you
want, but never casual.  You feel an urge?  Touch its pain, wrap yourself
around it.  Don't put on airs.  What you seem must be what you are, and what
you are is a mess, honey, but that's okay, as long as you wear it inside.
Look sharp!  Don't slouch.  See anyone slouching here?  Stay poised, taut,
hard.  Listen to your nerves.  It's zero hour.  Anxiety encroaches, wave after
wave, with every squeeze of the bandoneon.  Already twisted by the contraposto
of uprightness and savagery, this new tango turns the screw even tighter with
its jazz dissonances and truncated phrasings.  No relief.  No quarter.  At
zero hour, only passion can save you.  Time is flowing backward and forward
into the vortex.  From the rooms come a warm air and a choked melody of
syncopated gasps.  Something throbs...

America column... an overview of the new Winnebiko system.  Like all
work-in-progress, it keeps changing -- this will inevitably become inaccurate
or incomplete as time passes.  But here in February, 1989, it's about right.
    Enjoy!

     Well, I'm doing it again.  I'm living that old familiar
pre-launch blend of terror, overload, excitement, and project
management.  Settled in the fringes of Silicon Valley with the Vacuum
Velocipodiatrist and Chip the fantasy sculptor, Maggie and I
entertain friends, build systems, work with sponsors, and spend
countless hours rearranging bits on hard disk.  We putter in the
garden, chase off to speaking gigs, and even rent the occasional
video.  We visit friends -- square dancing with little girls one
weekend, creeping through midnight woods the next, having business
meetings the next.  We make forays to Livermore Labs to buy the
cast-off furniture of America's national defense establishment.  And
through it all, the window of fleeting opportunity that separates
past from future moves inexorably onward, onward, bringing us slowly
closer to our next abrupt escape into everything that Silicon Valley
is NOT.

     But for now we're Milpitian suburbanites pro tem, living in
comfort with friends.  It won't last forever, of course, so we
chuckle at our luxurious space and flagrant energy consumption with
only occasional twinges of guilt, nuking the leftovers and waking to
the gentle pattering of automatic sprinklers.  It seems an
extravagance, even though this is the low-rent end of the Valley (the
house we wanted back in Palo Alto rents for $30,000 a year... $82 a
day plus expenses.  For a ROOF!)

     The reason for all this illusory stability, of course, is the
Winnebiko -- that perennial obsession of mine, both mistress and
tyrant... that vaguely bicycle-like extravaganza of surface-mount
circuit boards and gleaming antennae.  The machine is undergoing
surgery so major that I have begun to realize that it's becoming a
whole new bike, constructed of treasures imported from afar and mined
here in the Valley, all layered together like a silicon spanakopita
atop my faithful old recumbent frame.  I haven't told you much about
the new system yet, other than to hint at satellite communications,
expanded computing power, and wide bandwidth user interfaces.  Since
this chapter is a sort of literary pivot between bike generations,
perhaps now is the time...even though it's dangerous to write about
things that aren't done yet.  Changes are assured, for every new
low-power bifurcated widgetframus that looks even halfway bikeable
sets my wetware CAD system afire with system-enhancement fantasies.
(There's the disclaimer.)

                                * * *

     I suppose I should make a quick comment about the reason for all
this.  You've already read the basics in previous CAA chapters, of
course:  ticket to nomadness, agile computing tool, combination of
passions, gizmological door-opener, etcetera.  None of that has
changed; it's only grown more ingrained over the years, part habit,
part obsession.  There are a few new twists, though...

     The next journey will be open-ended, and may well take us
overseas where rare is the access to modular phone jacks, power
outlets, and the whole automatic infrastructure of familiar American
society.  To do this right, I want near-total independence in all
domains:  computation, communication, electric power, propulsion,
life-support, and so on.  This instantly escalates the Winnebiko
system to a new level.

     That, plus the bottom line:  it has to be fun.  The old machine
is obsolete.  It's architecturally inflexible and much too hardware
intensive.  Changes of function require a soldering iron instead of a
screen editor.  It does too little for its weight.  There's no
computing horsepower of any real consequence, there's too little
solar power, setup of the radio systems is a pain, and, well, it's
just boring by current standards of engineering elegance.  And so the
celebrated console system is being retired, consigned to a wood stand
under a dust cover in the CAA museum.

     But rising like a Phoenix from the ashes of the past is the
Winnebiko III...

                                * * *

     I don't want to go into too much detail here, for it could,
quite literally, fill a textbook.  But during the coming months, as
these stories ooze slowly from solder-burned fingers into a laptop
buried in the clutter of my workbench, you might grow impatient for
real adventure.  It's out there, believe me.  Lots of it.  But
first... the engineering adventure... a new machine.

     There's lots of power on this one:  my current system with 20
watts of solar panels, 12 amp-hours of batteries, and a plug-in
charger could never support all the new equipment.  The new bicycle
carries 118 watts of solar panels, a regenerative braking system to
turn hard-won potential energy into something more useful than hot
brake pads, and the ability to use any external power source from a
car cigarette lighter to 220 AC.  All this dumps into a charge bus,
which is tapped by three dedicated controllers attached to three 15
amp-hour batteries -- one in the trailer, one in the communications
equipment bay behind the seat, and one up front in the console.

     Managing that is one of the myriad tasks performed by the
bicycle control processor (BCP) -- which is now a 68000 running
FORTH, linked by SCSI bus to an I/O expansion unit serving the whole
bike and a network of other computers.  There are dedicated
microprocessors for text-to-speech synthesis, automatic transmission
control, satellite and ham station control, local area network
management, security and remote operations, variable-reluctance
motor-generator control, and so on.

     None of this takes care of the applications layer -- that's all
to run the bike systems.  On top of the whole control environment is
another network:  two DOS systems (a 286 and a V40) to handle CAD,
satellite tracking, text, database, and software development.  One
would be enough in theory, but the 286 board is power hungry... I use
the little one when primarily waiting for keystrokes and not
interested in heavy duty processing horsepower.  The two share a 40
megabyte hard disk, a 3.5" floppy, and a tape backup unit.  And along
with the obligatory math coprocessor, there may be an RTX-2000 FORTH
engine dedicated to image processing for video capture, hidden-line
plotting for topographic mapping, and other calculation-intensive
tasks.

     I carry a separate laptop in the new manpack, of course, but
it's a lightweight machine.  When off-bike and needing file support
(or wishing to check status of autonomous subsystems), I can sign on
via the UHF business band.  The bike first responds at a low BBS-like
level, accepting a special command to boot the BCP for remote FORTH
command-line control of the whole system.  If I want to get into the
DOS environment, another reserved word boots the 286 and redirects
console I/O via the radio link to my backpack system, eliminating the
need to carry heavy hardware anywhere except in the bike itself
(where there is space for good shock-mounting).

     Any of the communications features can be accessed from any
operating level, whether in remote mode, from the handlebar keyboard
while pedaling, or from the maintenance keyboard while stopped.
Cellular phone modem, packet radio, local network control... all are
essentially servers on the network.

     The new console, by the way, is designed to be as flexible as
possible.  Most of its real estate is given over to a pair of giant
LCD panels -- one VGA backlit display (640 X 480) and the other a
more conventional laptop display.  A surface acoustic wave
touchscreen covers both, and any processor can request either...
depending on power budget, ambient lighting conditions, and
resolution requirements.  Typically, the BCP's status and maintenance
functions are on the little one, and graphics-intensive DOS (and,
eventually, Mac) applications are mapped to the big one.  One
particularly interesting project is computer-generation of wireframe
map models, showing from any viewpoint the earth's surface in my
immediate vicinity with road vectors overlaid in bold strokes and my
own location a blinking arrow.  (The databases are on CDROM; my
location is derived from a GPS satnav receiver.)  Entries from the
contacts database can then appear as icons, which, when touched,
expand into text windows.  In addition, if time permits, there will
be a helmet-mounted display that presents text or graphics "in the
sky" at a comfortable focal length.  All this allows wider-bandwidth
I/O with the neuron-based parallel wetware system under the helmet,
with speech, three display spaces, a thumb mouse, handlebar keyboard,
and touchscreen as comm channels.

     Other front panel devices include a miniature 300 dpi graphic
printer for sponsor referrals and business paperwork, digital
instrumentation for speed, cadence, altitude, temperature, time, and
raw power measurements, and a minimal assortment of switches and LEDs
to provide low-level maintenance access in the event of a major
system crash.  The important thing here is that everything on the
bike, except for basic safety equipment like lights, is under
computer control and thus completely hackable.

     The architecture that keeps this from being an interface
nightmare is the key to the whole machine.  I call it a "resource
bus," linking as it does all nodes in the system -- power, audio,
serial, analog, and digital.  The devices on the bus are diverse:  a
MIDI music synthesizer, all dedicated micros, radio equipment,
cellular phone, stereo, digital answering machine, printer, fax
board, modem, nav system, speech synthesizer, audio function modules,
and so on.  The bus is only a bus in philosophical terms -- up close
it's a massive FET crosspoint matrix with each junction controlled by
a bit in a write-only memory (finally a use for one of those!).  The
implications are interesting:  any interconnection is simply a matter
of programming (SMOP), which at the FORTH level is pretty easy.  I'll
be able to run phone patches between ham radio and cellular while
mobile, remotely redirect local audio through an RF link to my pack
if security is triggered, perform diagnostics, have the bike's speech
synthesizer beacon on ham radio frequencies live updates of its
exact location if it's moved without the correct password, turn alpha
particle hits into MIDI boing events, fax out digitized video images,
and so on... all using the resource bus and some basic software
drivers.

     Mechanically, the new bike is growing in sophistication as well.
I've never been happy with my brakes, so the new machine detects the
first displacement of the right-hand brake lever as a command to
begin proportionally drawing power from the trailer wheels via custom
microprocessor controlled hub motors.  A hard squeeze invokes a
hydraulic disk brake on the rear wheel, and the other lever is a
purely hydraulic link to a front rim brake.  The transmission is
changing too -- from a 54-speed manual to a 36-speed automatic.
Here, the processor monitors speed, pedal torque, cadence, heart
rate, and a keyed-in "wimp factor" that expresses my subjective
robustness... changing gears to optimize the impedance match between
bio-engine and wheels.

     One of my big thrills in this has always been communication,
ever since those primitive few thousand miles in 1983-4 with 300-baud
acoustic cups and a CB radio.  I've been carrying 2-meter and HF ham
gear for a while -- now there's a 10-meter rig built in to take
advantage of the sunspot peak, as well as 2-meter and 70cm multimode
rigs.  An HF station is still on board with two antenna choices --
mobile vertical and wire dipole... and there are various links
between bike and backpack, my bike and Maggie's, and so on.  But the
best part is the new OSCAR-13 station (modes B and J):  I'll be able
to stop the bike, assemble a pair of crossed-yagi beams totalling
about 10 feet in length, fire up the satellite tracker software (it
calculates Keplerian elements, inputs my location from GPS or Loran,
and displays a world map showing the bird's location, azimuth and
elevation values, doppler shift, and other parameters).  With this
new satellite, I'll have a hemisphere of coverage at a time during a
half-dozen 6-hour windows a week from anywhere in the world, with the
ability to communicate via full-duplex audio under solar power.  The
uplink is about 30 watts... and the satellite's orbit takes it out to
22,000 miles at the apogee (2.8 earth diameters).

     Let's see... what else?  Oh -- what to do with extra solar power
from the 118 total watts available in full sun (almost 10 amps of 12
volts)?  Simple -- the software can either throw it into the trailer
wheels for a 1/8 horsepower boost, or use it to cool a Peltier-effect
device buried in an insulated space behind the seat.  This should
have some nice effects, including cold beer in a hot desert (one of
the world's great pleasures).

     There are various standalone additions -- a miniature digital
oscilloscope, a butane soldering iron, and countless improvements to
the camping and touring gear.  But you get the idea... this system is
an all-out effort aimed at creating a self-maintaining mobile
autonomous information platform, constantly in communication with a
worldwide network while freely wandering the earth's surface and
providing unlimited fun to the rider and companions.

     And that's the kind of design spec I like.

                                * * *

     Oh.  I did mention the word "companions," didn't I?  Two things
are happening that involve other people.

     First, I've been putting the word out for a while that we're
looking for a few exceptional people to take up this life of
nomadness with us.  The responses are trickling in... a lady named
Barbara is planning to travel with a high-end graphics and video
system to develop her concept for "artitorials," and I've been
getting mail in response to a recent usenet posting.  There seems to
be a hunger for adventure afoot in the land.  If you're interested in
knowing more, email me.

     Second, the human intellects and energetic companies that are
cooperating on this new machine represent a truly dazzling resource
of creative ability.  For almost six years, I've been collecting
wizards... and with some of the very best I am now forming an
ad-hocracy with two linked goals:  market Winnebiko spinoffs and take
on selected consulting projects.  If this one sounds interesting,
give Nomadic Research Labs a call at 408-263-0660.

     That's enough for now.  As the months wear on and the weather
turns seductive here at the base of the Diablo Range... as the
greening hills tease me with thoughts of whistling descents and
slowly changing vistas... as the legs tense in rhythmic urgency here
in my static space... I'll grow ever more desparate for the road.
It's out there, a near-infinite thing of wonder and possibilities,
unhurried, patient, waiting.  I pound away on eccentric machinery,
implementing dreams, thinking all the while of that cold beer in the
desert.  You'll be hearing from me at odd intervals:  bear with me
until the adventure toggles once again from intellectual to visceral.

     In the meantime...

                    Cheers from the lab!
                         Steve

OKAY, STEVE! Life to the life culture, death to the death culture!  How to
go!  I hope Don keeps passing these babies along.

Speaking strictly for myself, as always, I think I'd just stick a little
old Harley motor in the middle of all that.  Make that a big old Harley in
the middle.
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

So Desperados, I'm off to FL for some seafood, azaleas, and sun.  Have a
nice dream.
