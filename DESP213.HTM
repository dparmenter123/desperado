This is truly getting way out of hand.  I just talked to a guy at Harper's
who is not only going to run the Desert Storm rules in April's issue, but
he is paying me 50 bucks and getting me a free subscription since I told
him I read it every month in the library.

In deference to other fine talk.bizarre posters, I should have included
a rule about  hollering "Go jump in a g*dd*mned volcano you f*ck*ng
cave newt" whenever Saddam's picture is shown.

        Saddam Hussein made a peace move over the weekend.  I heard some
        analyst on NPR analysing it:  "Saddam Hussein has extedended the
        fig leaf . . . no wait a minute!"  One imagines him continuing,
        "I meant the laurel leaf, no the olive branch, some piece of a
        plant.  An olive.  He extended an olive."

                                    =*=

        A controversy I can't buy:  Homosexuals in the military.  The
        army's current position is, "We'll keep 'em in until the
        hostilities are over and then out they go."  Well, this is the
        essence of hypocrisy to begin with, but the fact is that *millions*
        of homosexuals have served in the army and the army's official list
        of 14 homosexual soldiers is completely ridiculous.  Homosexuals
        join the army for the same reasons anyone else joins the army, some
        for pure patriotism, some from the simple desire for three hots and
        a cot, and most somewhere in between.

                                    =*=

        Another controversy I can't buy:  Peter Arnett of CNN is serving as
        a propaganda conduit for the Iraqis.  I love CNN because it has the
        police reporter's mentality (and so do I, of course).  Go where the
        story is and ask people what's happening.  Some of the people you
        ask are officials.  In fact, most of the people you ask are
        officials.

        Most news has passed through official hands before it gets to you.
        When I was doing this stuff, most of the news I gathered came from
        the cops.  I occasionally talked to the victims or their neighbors
        -- sometimes posing as a cop myself -- and on one or two occasions
        I talked to the murderer, or the accused, but most of what I got
        came from the coppers.

        If Peter Arnett were in Saudi Arabia, he'd be getting information
        from our cops, but since he's in Bagdad, he's getting information
        from their cops.  Big deal.  He's no idiot.  He knows how to figure
        out when the cops are lying.  All the news we're getting out of the
        gulf is slanted, spin-doctored, and official.

        I saw a bit on this so-called controversy on TV the other night,
        and if there's a more contemptible publicty hound and opinion
        monger than Reed Irvine of Accuracy in Media, then that's a pretty
        damn contemptible hound-monger.  This Reed Irvine has liar and
        hypocrite indelibly stamped all over his face and body.  A genuine
        creep.

        And Pat Buchanan is another.  He remained pro-Hussein right
        from August 2 through January and then changed his tune when the
        shooting started.

        And Admiral Thomas Moorer (ret., conveniently) opined "The press
        can't tell the difference between peace and war."

                                    =*=

        I picked up a book called something like the GDW Guide to Operation
        Desert Shield.  GDW is Game Designers Workshop and they've put
        together a useful handbook on the weapons, forces, history, and
        issues in this war, along with a detailed map of the region of most
        likely military operations.  Marked on the map, along with "oil
        fields" and "pipelines", and terrain features like "salt marsh" and
        "rocky" -- lots of "salt marsh" and *lots* of "rocky", interspersed
        with "lava" -- you'll find dozens of notations marking "fort" and
        "ruins".  Out in the middle of nowhere -- there's lots of "nowhere"
        too -- you can see two forts facing each other across a little
        wadi.

        This territory has been fought over for a long long time. Last fall
        I read a book about the first European woman to travel in the
        Arabian peninsula.  (Her name was Freya Stark and she ranks either
        first or second in my list of admirable prose stylists.)  She was
        travelling through Mesopotamia back in the late 20s and conditions
        were primitive and the inroads of civilization were few.  It was
        still the Middle Ages there, except that from time to time, when
        she became ill or needed something special, she popped out of the
        Middle Ages and went to one of the dozens of RAF bases then dotting
        the Arabian peninsula.  Like I say, this has been going on for some
        time.

                           Separate Think on the War

        "As for the shooting, it occurred to me that the war as it stands
        today (February 15 at 3 pm or so) is really an extension of the
        sanctions.  The sanctions weren't stopping all goods and supplies
        from getting into or out of Iraq, so the air attack constituted a
        change from sanctions to blockade and siege, but still the same
        policy as the sanctions.  A ground war would be a much bigger
        change than going from the sanctions to the air war was."

        I wrote that paragraph Friday afternoon.  I thought it up all by
        myself, honest.  But the very next morning, I discovered just that
        same position being excoriated as the no-win, total-wimpy-wuss,
        liberal position.  Damn!  And I thought I was being hardnosed.

                                    =*=

        I do take the total-wimpy-wuss position on whether I "support" this
        war or not.  There are strategic goals being pursued, unlike
        Vietnam.

        I just heard the other day that a soldier I know was spit on by a
        civilian during the Vietnam years.  Considering that he's 6'3", the
        spitter showed considerable faith in the discipline and correct
        behavior of the American soldier in spitting on him.  My friend
        brushed off the insulting attack more or less the way he brushes
        off the people today who rush up to him and wring his hand to say
        they support our troops.  It's the job, the way he sees it, to
        ignore the emotional stuff and stick to the work, which is tough
        enough.  So, respect the troops, whatever you think of the policy.

Subj:   Desperado #3041: Buggre Alle this for a Larke.

           I don't care if you're a hawk or dove, humanist or hardware freak,
           didn't it make you want to puke to hear that the stock market shot
           up 70 points because the war began?

Oh, come on now.  It didn't go up "because the war started", it went
up because early reports from the war were so optimistic.

Before the war began, even the most optimistic pro-war people were
saying that the price of crude would go way up initially due to fears,
but that it would probably come back down if everything went well.
In fact, the price of crude only went down.

A lot of fear of what the war might do had already been discounted,
i.e., the stock market's level had been gradually falling due to fear
of war.  Louis Rukeyser on Wall Street Week was teasing the Wall
Street community, calling them "lily-livered peace-lovers", because it
had become so evident that the market was going up whenever peace
looked more likely ("Gee, Baker and Aziz have been talking seven whole
hours, they must have agreed on something") and fell whenever it
looked more likely ("Regrettably, we heard nothing that...").  This
tendency had become extremely obvious over the few weeks preceeding
the war.

With all due respect, Your apparent implication, that the investment
community becomes deleriously happy as soon as people are being
killed, is quite unfair.  If that's not what you were implying, I
apologize and would like to know what you *were* implying.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I was implying what I said.  I didn't give it deep study.  That was a gut
reaction, if you will.  It's a different war now and the investment
community has a different set of concerns.

And there's still not been a peep about gas and oil conservation from our
Executive Branch.

Subj:   Re: Symbology [For DESPERADO]

&gt; The first really big use of those "equally meaningless in all known languages"
&gt; symbols was at the World's Fair in Montreal (1970 or thereabouts).  They used
&gt; an obviously male figure, standing arms akimbo, as the symbol for "men's
&gt; room".  For "women's room", they used an obviously female figure, standing
&gt; in the same position.
&gt;
&gt; Question:  What was the woman doing?

Easy.  What women do for the largest percentage of the time while in a
women's room in a large public gathering: wait in line for an
empty stall.

(We can tell you haven't spent much time in "ladies's restrooms"  :-)  )

Lisa

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
A lady in Dallas got sick of waiting in line for the proper restroom and
cut in on the men's line.  She more or less yelled out "Coming through!"
when she opened the door, headed straight for a stall, completeted her
appointment with destiny and walked out of the men's rooms into the arms of
a cop who arrested her for violation of all sorts of Texas laws.  She was
acquitted by a co-ed jury.

I assume everyone understands that providing numerically equal restroom
facilities for men and women is tantamount to providing unequal facilities
for  women.  Sort of like the reverse of the life-insurance problem, but
more immediate.

On the other hand, "their" restrooms are cleaner, floors particularly, and
sometimes have cots.  (Wouldn't want the latter without the former.)

You should see the toilets in Norway.  Now that's clean.

For Desperado, from the Risks Digest:

"911 calls are ripe for trouble"
Austin American-Statesman

BLACKSBURG, VA (AP) -- These are hardly salad days for Montgomery county
law officials.  Last week, police were testing the county's 911 system,
scheduled to begin operating next month, when the dispatcher received 10
calls that were traced to the home of Linda and Danny Hurst.  She tried to
call the line, but it was busy.  When she hung up, she received another
call from the same line.  And another.

Deputy sheriff tracked down Linda Hurst.  "I told them I'd locked my house
and there shouldn't be anyone in there," she said.  Police, concerned that
someone had broken in, asked Hurst to meet them at her house.  She parked
in front of the house, and walked up to the front door.  "But they said,
'Ma'am, step back please.'  I looked back and they had their guns drawn.
They were serious," Linda Hurst said.  "They went through the house, but
they couldn't find anybody, so I went inside."

Finally, Linda Hurst's brother spotted the culprit - an overripe tomato.
The tomato was hanging over the telephone in a wire basket, dripping juice
into the couple's answering machine.

Chief Deputy Milton Graham said the tomato juice apparently got into the
telephone's dialing system and caused it to dial the sheriff's office.
"We're not sure how.  Maybe they had speed dialing and it shorted out," he
said.  "I didn't know the answering machine could even dial out," Linda
Hurst said. "It's just supposed to take messages."

selected by Rodney R. Jones, Charles M. Sevilla, and Gerald F. Uelmen.

*****************************************************************************
Counsel: And you are involved I take it in both aspects of pathology
         here in your practice?

Witness: Yes.  I am certified in both.

Counsel: Directing your attention to the 6th of November 1976, in the
         evening hours, do you recall being up at Rose Chapel in Paradise?

Witness: Yes.

Counsel: Do you recall examining a person by the name of Rodney Edgington
         at the funeral chapel?

Witness: Yes.

Counsel: Do you recall approximately the time that you examined the body of
         Mr. Edgington at the Rose Chapel?

Witness: It was in the evening.  The autopsy started at about 8:30 P.M.

Counsel: And Mr. Edgington was dead at that time, is that correct?

Witness: No, you dumb asshole.  He was sitting on the table wondering why
         I was doing an autopsy.

*****************************************************************************
D.A.:    What is the meaning of sperm being present?

Witness: It indicates intercourse.

D.A.:    Male sperm?

Witness: That is the only kind I know.

*****************************************************************************

Counsel: Are you qualified to give a urine sample?

Witness: Yes, I have been since early childhood.

*****************************************************************************

Defense Counsel: So if I hit the prosecutor at this very moment and he fell
         over the back of this railing, hit his head and a subdural hematoma
         immediately began to form, the blood that was leaking into the space
         would have essentially the same components as the blood leaking
         into his teeny little brain?

*****************************************************************************

The Court: In this case the request is made for the appointment of the
           psychologist for the performance of an IQ test.  The court
           does not see the need for an IQ test since it appears to me
           that he is dumber than a fencepost.

Counsel:   Has the court stated it in numerical terms?

The Court: His IQ is less than zero.

*****************************************************************************

Counsel: What device do you have in your laboratory to test alcohol content?

Witness: I have a dual column gas chromatograph, Hewlett-Packard 5710A with
         flame analyzation detectors.

The Court: Can you get that on mag wheels?

Witness: Only on the floor models.

*****************************************************************************

Counsel: Now, in your report under "Foundation" you indicated that there is
         a minimum of cracking and no signs of settling.

Witness: Yes.

Counsel: When you say there is a minimum of cracking, I take it that you did
         find some cracking.

Witness: No.  Because if I said there was no cracking, I would be in court

Subject: FrameMaker Spell Checker

I happened to be writing letter in FrameMaker this morning and using
the spelling checker. When it came to the work "Interleaf" the spelling
check listed it as a misspelled word. I can understand this since
Interleaf is not in any dictionary I know of.

The funny thing is what the spell checker recomended as a correction --
"FrameMaker". That's right, "FrameMaker" as the correction for the word
"Interleaf". Are those Frame programers trying to tell us something.

I think I'll test it and see if the spelling checker does the same thing
for ArborText, and troff.

        Once upon a time, long ago in places all but forgotten, there
were systems. Now, the system was mighty indeed, and the people were
sore afraid of what it could do. It came to pass that those who couldst
run the machine paid homage to those who couldst program the machine,
whilst those who actually knew in their hearts how it worketh, and could
perform the magic of troubleshooting and degugging were dearest to the
gods. The rabble was rouseth, and began to moan at the mighty oaken I/O
counter, "Were we put here to be assaulted by noise, and struck low by
return decks of cards into which we poureth our very souls? Surely there
is amongst us one who is mightier than the machine, and can fixeth this
million dollar phone bill in this lifetime!"
        And it came to pass, that out of the East came a man with vision
far beyond those with whom he toiled. He was heard to sayeth, "a person is
mightier than any machine. We shouldst have the machine worketh for us
instead of endless toil to please the insatiable gods of input and output.
There is no mystery, follow me and I will taketh us toward the light that
holdeth our future."
        The people heard this and were sore afraid. "The machine makers
swallow whole, anyone foolhardy enough to challenge their absolute power."
        The man said, "give me people, and give me capital, and I will
show you what humans can accomplish." This confounded many, because they
had spent too many hours at keypunch and flowcharting stations, and had
forgotten their humaness.
        They asked of the machine makers "can this be done, or is he truly
mad?" But the noise of the card reader and magnetic drum in demonic
communication with the machine drowned out the cries, and the machine
people went into decline.
        Now it came to pass, that the people who followed the man, brought
forth all manner of advances. The machine became a slave of the people, not
the evil master it had been before.  People were free to create all manner
of wonderous things, and did so with great abandon. Some they soldeth, others
were cast into the pond, but none were so evil they had no redemption for
they were works of people and could always maketh do as a doorstop.
        As the time went by, the perception of the man grew and grew until
he became the fodder for magazine covers and pesky rodents called interviewers.
They asketh the same thing over and over, but he did not anger, rather he
preferred to taketh upon himself the hounding jackals, and let his people
remain free to create and prosper.
        In a school laboratory in a small hamlet, an untoward chemical
reaction occurred as the result of no parity memory. The noxious fumes
drifted over the once fertile minds deliberating there, and they were horribly
transfigured. These mutants were quick to multiply, though they have no sex
identity, and are indeed interchangeable. They lusted after all manner of
things, but lacked the fundemental knowledge to name them, hence decided to
use only initials, and to buy things that had numbers in their titles. When
it was pointed out to them they had no marketable skills in which to buy these
things, they met and pooled their remaining brain cell and invented all
manner of methods, to share in the bounty being created and discovered around
them, without actually taking part in the labors thereof. "We shall administrate
the world!", they cried. The people scorned and mocked them, for they knew not
of the dark power driving them.
        They called themselves mutant bastard androids because if it hadn't
been for the mutant virus, they would have had to find honest labor. The family
that had nurtured them could possibly want something in the hereafter, so it
was best to forsake them preemptively. The Android represented the ideal bottom
line because it could replace those people who maketh such a stink about
efficiency. Things went on as before, but there was an air of foreboding
that grew with each team of mba's brought in to study the resulting data of
the group that had come before.
        The great were made humble, and the competent were were admined to
great lengths. Nouns became verbs, productivity and quality suffered and died.
Oganized chaos became networking, which could be used as any part of a sentence.
The mutants attached themselves to each limb of every organization, and grew
with each revision of the organization chart. Perfectly good minds, far from
the laboratory withered and died, reduced to speaking in words of Buzz, and
wanting only to keep covered, that part of the anatomy from which waste
issueth.
        Out of the swirling vortex of what had been a proud venture arose
a slime covered creature so huge, so complex, so all encompassing that it
became known simply as, THE PROCESS. Deep within its recesses lay all the
answers, if one would'st just seek them out, rock by rock. The beauty of THE
PROCESS was, that no one could know all of it, no one needed to know any
of it, and no one could dispute it. All it took to make THE PROCESS work,
was for everyone to follow it. It would'st feed itself, and grow on its
own, until

To:     anarky::pirate
Subj:   QUestions for the list....

Let me take up the first part of Will Martin's question, since someone else
posted the second (interference on 7415)...

There are no hard and fast rules on where/when to find pirates.  Last year
I heard pirates mostly at 0300-0700 UTC...weekends were active, but for
awhile it seemed like *every night* was a big night (Radio Clandestine
was really active then, along with KRUD).  Now, I seem to get them Friday
through Monday from 2000-2300.  Again, even this isn't a sure thing.
An interesting time is major holidays (4th of July, Memorial Day, New
Years' Eve, and Halloween (I heard Crystal Ship Radio one Halloween about
5 years ago or so).  I fully expected April 1st to be active, and
according to George Zeller (relayed via the ANARC net) it was busy in
his area (Cleveland, I believe), but it was dead here in New York State.

As to where to listen, 7415 kHz is still (as far as I can tell) predominant,
though many others are being reported (e.g. 1620, 6240, 7395, 7448, 15043
              Khz, et. al.).

Because of the nature of pirate radio, rarely will tests be preannounced;
one announcement came in over the ANARC net, but I didn't hear the test,
though I tried.

The only tips I can offer are (1) patience...I usually monitor 7415 20 hours
or more a week, late afternoon into the night (2) pay particular attention
to your antenna/receiver...frankly, these pirates aren't known for having
wonderful signals (Radio Clandestine, however, had a beautiful signal...
better than some SW broadcasters I've heard).  In my case, I'm using a
Yaese FT-747GX amateur radio tranceiver/gen. coverage receiver and a
104' long dipole up 30' in the air and fed with RG-8M coax.  However,
I have heard pirates with a Sangean and a wire to a window screen.  Really,
I'd spend time on the antenna...you can have a $4000 receiver with a whip
antenna and a $200 receiver with a good dipole (or better antenna)...in
almost all cases, the $200 receiver will catch the signal better.

Many of the techniques used for DXing hams or SW broadcasters really do
apply to pirates, except they're more unpredictable.  Try listening on a
Saturday afternoon on 7415 from about 1800-0000 UTC and see if anything
pops up.  That might be your best bet.

Oh, another good thing to do is to listen to the ANARC net (7240 Khz LSB
starting at 10 AM EDT...can usually be heard on the East Coast easily)...
you can find up-to-date info there (if you can't hear it, don't worry...
I copy down all the pirate loggings and submit them immediately to this
list).  It's been said pirates occasionally pop up on 7415 right after the
net, but I haven't heard them up there.

Make sure to keep a tape recorder handy...it's some of the funniest radio
this side of Howard Stern on WXRK-FM New York. :-)

    Two lions escape from the zoo.  They decide that they'd better split

    Three months go by and they meet at the appointed place.  One is very

    The Robust One (TRO):  What happened to you?  You look terrible!

    The Skinny One (TSO):  When we split up, I went to a nearby village.
    All I did was to eat one small person, and the villagers got very
    upset.  They started chasing me with guns!  I've been on the run ever
    since and haven't had a thing to eat since then.

    TRO: That's too bad.

|Subject: FW: Dead Whale Story
|Date: Fri Dec 14 12:47:11 PDT 1990
|
|I am absolutely not making this incident up; in fact I have it all on
|videotape, which I obtained from the alert father-son team of Dean and
|Kurt Smith.  The tape is from a local TV news show in Oregon,
|which sent a reporter out to cover the removal of a 45-foot,
|eight-ton dead whale that washed up on the beach.  The responsibility
|for getting rid of the carcass was placed upon the Oregon State
|Highway Division, apparently on the theory that highways and whales
|are very similar in the sense of being large objects.
|
|So anyway, the highway engineers hit upon the plan -- remember, I am not
|making this up -- of blowing up the whale with dynamite.  The thinking
|here was that the whale would be blown into small pieces, which would be
|eaten by sea gulls, and that would be that.  A textbook whale removal.
|
|So they moved the spectators back up the beach, put a half-ton of
|dynamite next to the whale and set it off.  I am probably not guilty of
|understatement when I say that what follows, on the videotape, is the
|most wonderful event in the history of the universe.  First you see
|the whale carcass disappear in a huge blast of smoke and flame.
|Then you hear the happy spectators shouting "Yayy!" and "Whee!"
|Then, suddenly, the crowd's tone changes.  You hear a new sound
|like "splud."  You hear a woman's voice shouting "Here come pieces
|of...  MY GOD!"  Something smears the camera lens.
|
|Later, the reporter explains:  "The humor of the entire situation
|suddenly gave way to a run for survival as huge chunks of whale
|blubber fell everywhere."  One piece caved in the roof of a car
|parked more than a quarter of a mile away.  Remaining on the beach
|were several rotting whale sectors the size of condominium units.
|There was no sign of the sea gulls, who had no doubt permanently
|relocated in Brazil. This is a very sobering videotape.  Here
|at the institute we watch it often, especially at parties.  But
|this is no time for gaiety.  This is a time to get hold of the folks
|at the Oregon State Highway division and ask them, when they get
|done cleaning up the beaches, to give us an estimate on the US
|Capitol.
