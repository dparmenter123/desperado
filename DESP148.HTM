How many of us Desperadi depend on the Corporate Tuition Reimbursement
Policy in order to make it possible for us to attend college?

I just got my tuition reimbursement money from DEC.  It was in the form
of a payroll check, sans $175 for taxes.  $175 I was counting on to be
paid to B.U..

I asked Personnel.  That's the way it is, they said.  DEC is still paying
you full tuition reimbursement, but Uncle Ron is taking 1/3 of it.  So
we don't care that you owe an addition $175, that's not our fault.

But, I protested, when we get relocation (another taxable benefit) DEC
increases the amount of the benefit to cover the taxes and they give it
to us mixed in with our salary at the end of the year!

We can easily track relocation with that system, she said.  But we can't
track tuition reimbursements like that!  We have to make sure that everyone
pays taxes on it!!

But what's the difference between the two benefits??  A problem with one
means a problem with both!!  Why is Digital assuming the role of IRS
Sherriff and thereby penalizing US for those folks who seek to gyp the
IRS??

No answer.  I can't help you, she said.  That's just the way it is.

Can we change it, I asked?  Is there anything we can do?

Don't bother, she said.  No one cares.  We're merely doing what we have to
do.  You're getting your benefit.  Would you rather pay for it all yourself?

I'm sorely disillusioned, again.  I was disillusioned over the PRO and learning
we'd been lied to, moreso to find out we DON'T get paid for performance. We only
get TOLD we get paid for performance....  No one cares...  We don't matter
after all, so what difference does it make?   I might as well be sweeping
floors at D.G.

I know I'll get slung with "You have a job.." and "DEC's on top -- be thankful
for that..."  That doesn't make me feel better.  I'd rather work in a place
where I at least know what to expect.  I guess I value at least trusting
in honesty....  It's not the same DEC.  And they don't care.
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I had all kinds of sage things to say about the rules on taxation of
tuition reimbursement, and relocation, et cetera, et cetera, when it
finally dawned on me that you're not talking about taxes, you're talking
about corporate culture. (Be easy on me, folks, field test in two weeks,
and I'm no longer sure I recognize a comma when I see one.) I've recently
gone through a similar mill with personnel issues, and in my rage and
despair spent a lot of time yelling about "Well, so what about the bottom
line! Don't they care about PEOPLE anymore!" And it finally dawned on me
that no, this isn't the same company as it was ten years ago.
DEC still has the welfare of its people at heart, I think, but in the
new economic reality, which is a dream in the mind of those supreme
reality inventors, Wall Street, DEC is digging in instead of spreading
itself. Sure, the stock price is high, what stock price isn't, these days?
But those wily Yankees in the front office know what's out there, and
they're putting quite a bit into the corporate sock to protect themselves --
and US, don't think they aren't -- from the hard times that may very well
be right around the corner.

NEMO, dear, don't despair. Yeah, it's a bite, and yeah, the style has
changed, but times move on, cultures move on. You're not the same person
you were ten years ago, and your needs change. So do DEC's. Although I'd
still bean the boorish Personnel person you spoke to over the head with
a bottle if I saw my chance.

I won't belabor the point. Flame off. Let the revels commence.

 "Never mind the finish" - Allen Michels, C. Gordon Bell team up
   Venture capitalists like to say the bet on the jockey, not the horse. A row
 of big-time, first-tier venture capital funds recently put an $11 million bet
 on high-tech corporate jockey Allen Michels. And they don't seem to care that
 he has been known to fade in the stretch. Michels, 45, an ex-DEC and Intel
 marketing man, founded Convergent Technologies in 1979. In just six years the
 maker of office workstations had revenues of $395 million. Convergent went
 public at $13.50, climbed to over $40 in 1983, then wilted under poor
 management of its too-rapid growth. The stock fell to $4 and was recently $11.
   In the fall of 1985, Michels and a few Convergent veterans founded Dana Group
 Inc. Michels, who has sold all of the million or so shares of Convergent he
 once owned, has started planning again. Now he will try to market a very high
 performance desktop "personal supercomputer" for scientists and engineers.
 Michels has recruited some top talent from Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard Labs,
 as well as C. Gordon Bell, who was one of the principle designers of the DEC
 VAX. This race will require the most advanced computer and semiconductor
 technology, and potential competitors lurk. Moreover, that $11 million is only
 the first round in an expensive and risky undertaking.
   Why then would the venture capital crowd bet money on a man whose first
 venture ran into trouble after only five years? Most likely they weren't
 holding when the stock hit $4. "Convergent gave a huge return to its initial
 investors," says Michels. "If I were an investor who wanted to do that again I
 would invest in me." And try to cash in before the clubhouse turn.

                              A VACATION GUMBO

      A couple of weeks ago, Steadfast Love and I met the Jolly
      Canadian and His Flame in New Orleans for a week of serious
      gluttony.  We had no detailed itinerary.  We figured on spending
      a couple or three days in New Orleans proper and the rest of the
      time jaunting around Cajun country.  Coffee and beignets at Cafe
      du Monde, muffulettas from Central Grocery, pralines (for the
      womenfolk, each of whom has a sweet tooth) -- well, those would
      simply go to sustain life.  The primary goal was, of course,
      dinner at K-Paul's Lousiana Kitchen, the expensive, hole-in-the-
      wall restaurant run by Paul Prudhomme.  As it turned out, our
      paths would cross with Paul Prudhomme's a couple of times in the
      rest of the week.  So here's a travelogue, with recipes.

      Monday

      We got into the city Monday afternoon, Memorial Day, and checked
      into the Chateau Motor Hotel on Chartres Street, which the
      locals pronounce "Charter." Nicely rehabilitated place -- the
      "motor" in the title refers to the hotel's having a small
      parking lot across the street.  Anyway, it's a few short blocks
      from Cafe du Monde (in one direction) and K-Paul's (in another
      direction).  Logistics, you know.

      K-Paul's does not take reservations.  It's open only for a few
      hours for dinner and closed on weekends.  We were all hungry,
      being still on Eastern Daylight Time.  So the Jolly C, who had
      been to New Orleans a few years ago, got in line right away,
      while the rest of us took an orientation stroll.  (Next to
      Antoine's, there's a tobacconist's shop, started by a diner who
      wanted to be able to get a decent post-prandial cigar.  One of
      my few talents is being able to turn up a tobacconist's shop in
      any city I go to, the way an habitual gambler can always find
      the local crapgame.)

      We ended up waiting in line (light drizzle) for about 40
      minutes.  By and by there was entertainment from a street dancer
      (terrible) and a saxophonist (pretty fair and a dead ringer for
      Hawk on "Spenser: For Hire").  Eventually, a waitress came out
      to address the line, explaining the seating policy.  Parties
      aren't split up, but every seat is filled family style.  The
      restaurant is quite unpretentious (compared, say, to Brennan's
      or the Court of Two Sisters); there's a neon sign in the window
      for Dixie beer, the local working-stiff's brand.

      We were among the first seated, entering buoyantly while the
      staff clapped in time to some vaguely Cajun music.  The
      restaurant is L-shaped, with a bar running along the wall on the
      left.  The Jolly C, who has no inhibitions in such matters,
      immediately made to inspect the kitchen and pronounced the mis
      en place wholesome.  K-Paul's smells like, I imagine, paradise.

      What we had:

          Seven-steak gumbo (named for the bone used in the stock)
          "Cajun popcorn" (batter-fried crawfish)
          Boudin (rice sausage, this one filled with ground meat)
          Dixie beer (in long-necked bottles, of course)
          Trout with crawfish
          Blackfish with pecans (see recipe below)
          Blackened tuna
          Crawfish etouffe
          Assorted fresh rolls and muffins

      Very expensive, but if you accept that all very expensive
      restaurants are overpriced, it's worth it.  Superb food -- the
      menu changes daily, of course -- and excellent service.  Only
      the boudin was mediocre.  (We would have much better later in
      the week, on the road.)  It was one of the best meals of my
      life.

      Tuesday

      Breakfast of course was cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du
      Monde, one of those special places where if you stay long enough
      everyone you know or want to know will show up.  The coffee is
      lousy -- the chicory makes it taste like bad tea -- but the
      beignets are fine.  They're pillow-shaped, made of the same
      dough as yeast donuts, and covered with enough confectioner's
      sugar that you can't inhale near them.

      We had lunch at the Gumbo Shop, which was recommended to us by
      someone sharing our cab on the drive in from the airport.  It's
      a pleasant, garden-style restaurant where the titular dish is
      excellent and varied -- as good as the gumbo at K-Paul's -- and
      everything else is just okay.

      In the afternoon, we took a guided tour, run by the Jean Lafite
      National Park rangers, of the Garden District.  This was the old
      American neighborhood, when Americans weren't allowed to live in
      French Quarter and French weren't allowed in the Garden
      District.  It's not part of the Quarter.  You have to cross
      Canal Street and take the St. Charles trolley (last streetcar
      line extant).  One of the houses belonged to the uncle of the
      painter Degas.  (Uncle, a cotton merchant and the only Frenchman
      to live in the Garden District, appears in Degas's The Cotton
      Exchange.)  The ranger was an eccentric lady named (I swear)
      Evangeline.  If you go to New Orleans, be sure to get one of her
      tours.

      For dinner, we started with boiled crawfish and raw oysters at
      the French Market cafe.  The waitress showed us how to peel the
      crawfish -- they're like a cross between shrimp and lobster.
      The oysters were a little out of season and not quite like
      oysters in New England.  For dinner, we went to Miss Ruby's, a
      little place across from our hotel.  Superb pies -- peanut
      butter pie, chocolate fudge pie, lemon meringue pie.  Bring your
      own insulin.

      Steadfast, as usual, checked out for the night at 10PM (she has
      style, but no stamina).  The Jolly C, His Flame, and I strolled
      down Bourbon Street.  We were reliably informed that the best
      jazz is outside the Quarter, and there's not much of that.  (The
      Jolly C was unable to find the club that, we were told, is
      frequented by Marsalis pere et fils.)  Bourbon Street is sleezy,
      like Carnaby Street in London or Yonge Street in Toronto, a
      cross between tourist schlock and the Combat Zone.  Preservation
      Hall, by the way, is run-down hovel looking like an abandoned
      garage.  It's the size of a small office or a large bathroom,
      dark, dank, and dirty.  It's worth going to if you're a lover of
      Dixieland jazz and not claustrophobic.

      Wednesday

      Coffee and beignets...  The street-corner newspaper machines
      dispense the Times-Picayune, the Houston paper, and the national
      edition of the New York Times, which is a kind of yuppie version
      of USA Today.  Couldn't get the Globe and really missed Bob Ryan
      on the Celtics.  (Last damned time I take a vacation during the
      NBA playoffs.)

      Anyway, for lunch, we got muffalettas from Central Grocery on
      Decatur Street and ate in the park in Jackson Square.  A
      muffaletta is one of two classic New Orleans sandwiches.  It's
      Italian cold cuts and Provolone cheese, dressed with garlicky,
      chopped olive salad, on a slightly dry, crusty loaf of round
      bread with sesame seeds.  The other classic, perhaps better
      known, is the po' boy, which is roughly what Bostonians call a
      "grinder."  The criterion of authenticity is slices of dill
      pickle.

      We rented a car and set out for Cajun country.  At K-Paul's, the
      Jolly C learned that Prudhomme's sister has a restaurant in
      Washington, LA, so we determined to get there.  (Science marches
      on.)

      We had called the state tourist office in Baton Rouge for a list
      of guest houses in the area.  In New Iberia, we stayed with
      Colonel and Mrs.  Franz, whose house is the oldest in town.  The
      Colonel was a character.  When we arrived, he hastened to point
      out that he had put a bucket of ice in one of the bedrooms in
      case we felt the need for a cold drink -- what he called a
      "vivification" -- but the Jolly C and I had neglected to pack
      any booze, a deficiency we corrected the next day with a flask
      of Jack Daniel's.  I think the Colonel was a little disappointed
      in us for that.

      We had dinner at Patout's, which someone at K-Paul's had told us
      about and which we'd vaguely heard of before.  Alex Patout is a
      young, hustling chef, doomed to fame, though he doesn't think of
      it as doom.  If there restaurant were in New Orleans, he and his
      brother would steal some of Prudhomme's limelight.  He told us
      his cookbook is going to be published soon "by Random House" in
      time to cash in on the current craze for Cajun food.  He has
      also opened a restaurant in California and has his own winery.
      We tried the Chardonnay; good, but not distinguished (I like
      very oaky Cardonnay.)

      Patout's cooking derives from a 17th Century French style, he
      says, in which the sauces are reductions of pure and very fresh
      cream and butter.  Indeed, what Steadfast and I disliked about
      the food -- the Jolly C and His Flame liked it more -- was that
      everything was in a similar, rich cream sauce.  The menu was
      monomaniacal, almost solely seafood -- one or two chicken and
      veal dishes and no pork dishes at all.  (I didn't get a chance
      to ask him about that before he had to leave.)  Excellent
      stuffed potatoes.

      Thursday

      I'll skip the travelogue about plantation houses like Shadows-
      on-the-Teche (pronounced "tesh," it's the bayou).  At breakfast,
      Colonel Franz told us that the last owner of the Shadows, who
      had bribed the National Trust into taking the house as an
      historic building, was "nothing but a knee-walking drunk."  The
      Colonel was a man of eccentric eloquence.  He apologized that
      his wife didn't join us for breakfast because she was having her
      "hairpoo" that morning.  He told us that her night's prayer was,
      "O Lord, don't let me die tonight because tomorrow is hairpoo
      day." (Air Force humor, I guess.)

      Anyway, we also had a good long chat with Ray Patout (distant
      relative of the chef's), the foreman of a work crew at the
      Colonel's house, who gave us a superb lecture on Cajun
      architecture -- houses built with packed mud, horsehair, and
      Spanish moss.  There is some effort now to preserve these.

      From New Iberia, we swung south to Avery Island for a tour of
      the Tabasco factory and the bird sanctuary.  We arrived at the
      factory just as everyone was hooping into the back of pickup
      trucks and going to to lunch.  Where?  "At R.J.'s, down the
      road."  What do they have at R.J.'s?  "Well," the woman at the
      bird sanctuary told us, "I've ate there, but I ain't menu-ed
      it."

      R.J.'s turned out to be, not surprisingly, a roadside shack and
      a citadel of good country cooking.  We had sausage po' boys,
      fried catfish, shrimp, and cold RC cola.  Excellent.  Catfish,
      by the way, is delicious and isn't greasy or oily as you might
      expect a scavenger fish to be.  Steadfast thought it was a lot
      like schrod.

      Somewhere along the line we were told that Thursday night in
      Acadiana the place to be is Mulote's (pronounced "miu-LOTTS") in
      Breaux Bridge.  The food is good, not great -- huge portions, as
      everywhere in Cajun country.  (Interesting beer called Jolie
      Blonde, brewed in Texas for the Cajun market.  Strong.
      Beautiful label with a painting by the Cajun artist Rodrigue.)
      The real attraction is the Cajun dancing (live band).  The music
      is lively, but somewhat limited.

      Prudhomme was there.  The Jolly C spoke with him briefly; nice
      guy, very polite.  (Also very big.  He weighs, we were later
      informed by someone who works for him, 450 pounds and has
      weighed more.  He doesn't walk very well and seemed to need help
      going down a two-step flight of stairs.  Imagine crossing Dom
      Deluise and Orson Welles.  But for the beard, he's what I
      imagine Nero Wolfe to look like.)  Turns out he was filming a
      video -- the latest thing for cooks -- and came to Mulote's for
      background shots.

      Friday

      Ah, the day of the great boudin trek.

      It started with breakfast at Dempsey's cafe in Lafayette, a
      thriving little town.  Bacon and eggs, home-fries, grits.
      Across the parking lot, an artist named Robert Dafford was
      painting a mural on the wall of a store.  He does nice work.
      This one was a bayou scene meant to show the fauna coming to
      life out of a photograph.  He has another one in town, covering
      one wall of a tall bank building -- a hyper-realistic study of
      automobiles.  When the sun is right, the bumpers of the cars
      gleam like real chrome.  We spent about an hour with him and his
      helper, chatting about art, Acadiana, and the ecology of the
      Mississipi.  (Everybody we met -- everybody -- was gracious and
      willing to chat.  There was absolutely none of that Yankee-be-
      damned shit.  People are simply friendlier outside the tight-
      assed, Puritanical confines of New England.)

      Thence, we went to the Acadian Village, a Cajun version of
      Sturbridge Village.  Dafford has a couple of paintings there,
      depicting the expulsion of the Acadians.  The village is meant
      to preserve a 19thC.  Cajun bayou settlement.  It was used in
      filming a movie, just released I guess, called Belizaire the
      Cajun.  Part of the proceeds of the village support a nearby
      home for the retarded.  Typically, the Cajun houses have no
      closets and no interior stairs, because the Spanish taxed on the
      number of rooms and interior stairs.  Also, there's usually a
      single, central chimney, because there were taxes on chimneys.
      (Even some of the larger plantation houses have similar
      arrangments, with the upper rooms in a straight line, and no
      interior hallway.  Instead, you went from room to room by using
      the outside gallery.)

      Of course, Prudhomme was there, filming segues for his video.
      He sat on the porch of one of the houses, discussing what he
      calls a Cajun martini -- gin or vodka, with a jalapeno pepper
      and no vermouth.  Someone from the film crew told us that he
      always carries a pepper in his pocket to nibble on from time to
      time.

      At the recommendation of the guide at the Acadian Village, we
      stopped in a small town called Gran Coteau (with maybe the only
      hill in Louisina) to see a splendid oak alley.  More important,
      we had the best boudin of the trip, in Ivy's General Store.
      (Just as we walked in, the owner was staunching some blood from
      being attacked by her husband's pit bull terrier.  It is
      different down there.)  The boudin, filled with rice and ground
      pork, was made in Church Point by a company called Richard's,
      which supplies several stores in the area.  For the rest the day
      we stopped at every roadside stand to sample the boudin, but
      none of them were nearly as good.  One place did have a decent
      seafood boudin (mostly shrimp).  We also ate cracklings --
      rendered fatback with coarse salt.  (I haven't told Steadfast's
      doctor brother about that yet.)  There is a boudin festival the
      last week of February; I'd like to get back there for it.

      In Washington, LA, we had dinner at Prudhomme's sister's
      restaurant.  A little pricey for a small-town eatery, but huge
      portions and excellent food.  We had roast duck served on a bed
      of rice with a puree of sweet potatoes, rabbit, blackened
      grouper.  The dessert is complimentary -- what the locals call
      lagniappe.  The waitresses were Prudhomme's nieces, and yes, the
      family tends to run to size.  (Someone later told us that
      Prudhomme has a cousin weighing 700 pounds.  It can't all be on
      account of the food.)

      Saturday

      Meandering back to New Orleans, we followed the river route
      (even having to take a ferry at one point), and ogling a few
      plantation houses, especailly Oak Alley Plantation, which was
      used in filming several movies and TV shows.  The guides at the
      old plantations, as at the Gallier house in New Orleans, were
      frank about slavery.  They pointed out that the slave quarters
      in or attached to the houses were much better than the shacks
      for field slaves, and that house slaves were much better treated
      than field slaves.  On the other hand, the guides also said that
      most slaves stayed on the plantations after the Civil War.
      (Where the hell else where they going to go?)  Anyway, almost no
      one in Cajun country mentioned anything about Cajuns keeping
      slaves.

      The South is still quite segregated.  Driving through New
      Orleans and the small towns, you can always tell when you had
      crossed the racial boundary -- either the railroad tracks or a
      highway built in the old rail bed.  My hunch is that class
      follows race in the deep South more than in say, Virginia and
      Maryland, where there seems to be a significantly large black
      middle-class.  You can't really judge by New Orleans because
      it's flooded with tourists, black and white.

      Back in the city, while the others went museum-ing, I poked
      around the French Market, a Cajun version of Haymarket, and
      bought some stuff to take home -- a little less than a pound of
      file powder (ground sassafras leaves and thyme) and two jars of
      olive salad from Central Grocery.  Muffaletta for lunch down by
      the river.  (Damn, Jim, those tankers are big.)

      Our last dinner in New Orleans was at Brennan's.  The food was
      quite good (frogs' legs, turtle soup, veal, pompano), but the
      place is a little stuffy and snobbish.  For example, there are
      two wine lists.  One has the very expensive wines, mostly
      French; the other has varieties without specifying vintners or
      years.  When I asked about the Chardonnay, the head waiter, a
      veritable clotted asshole, sneered and explained that it would
      be whatever the cellar master decided to send up.  ("Cellar
      master?" I imagine someone looking like Marty Feldman in Young
      Frankenstein.)  Maybe I was over-reacting to the urbanity of the
      place, having eaten less formally on the road for three days
      before.  Across the room, Walker Percy the novelist was having
      dinner.

      Cajun vs. Creole

      The Cajuns are descendants of the Acadians, French settlers who
      were expelled from Nova Scotia by the British and eventually
      ended up in Louisiana, mainly via the Caribbean islands.  (Cf.
      Longfellow's Evangeline if you like that sort of thing.)  The
      Creoles are descendants of French immigrants (also, often by way
      of the Caribbean).  Cajuns seem to be rural; Creoles, urban.  A
      spice-monger at the French Market told me that the difference
      between Cajun cooking and Creole cooking is the difference
      between crawfish and shrimp.

      General Tourist Information

      The accent surprises you, because it's not the deep Southern
      drawl of Alabama or Mississippi.  Instead, it's closer to the
      squawk of Brooklyn or Queens, as though Phil Rizzuto had spent a
      lot of time with George Wallace.  Even outside New Orleans, the
      speech has a nasal tone you don't expect to hear much below New
      Jersey.  The Jolly C and I stopped to ask directions of a house
      painter who turned out to be an emigre Brooklynite.  "Picked up
      the accent pretty well, eh?" the Jolly C remarked.  "Well, it's
      not much different from the accent in the neighborhood I grew up
      in."

      The heat surprises you, too.  If you haven't lived in the South
      or haven't been there in a while, you're taken aback by how
      heavy the air is.  The heat makes you you feel the weight of the
      air, as though you're on a different planet with a stronger
      gravity, a thicker atmosphere.  Breathing is like inhaling
      syrup.  Everything and everyone move slowly.  It's an effort to
      move quickly.  It's not just the heat and dampness.  There's
      also a fragrant, dizzying lushness, even in swamp country (which
      is most of the state).  Steadfast says there were plants that
      she can barely grow indoors here that in Louisiana are casually
      thriving, if not huge.

      Don't try to drive in the Quarter.  It's like trying to drive in
      Boston's North End.  The cops patrol on motor scooters because
      the streets are so narrow.  Cabbies are bold and other drivers
      are as crazy as they are here.  Stop signs are considered
      decorative only.  One-way signs are considered recommendations.

      And yes, in the country side, I saw several road signs peppered
      with buckshot or birdshot.  Just like in New Hampshire.

from the San Francisco Examiner
===============================

UPI, Los Angeles

  When Robert Barbour applied for personalized license plates he never
dreamed it would lead to 2500 illegal parking tickets.
  Seven years ago, Barbour applied for personalized license plates that
would read "SAILING" or "BOATING".  The Department of Motor Vehicles
form contained a line for a third choice, but Barbour did not have a
third choice so he wrote "NO PLATE".  "NO PLATE" is exactly what he got.
  "At first I was angry that they would mess it up and not understand
what I meant," said Barbour.  "But then I realized how original the
plates were."
  It only took four weeks for him to realize just how original.  He
received a notice from the San Francisco Municipal Court that an illegal
parking fine was overdue.
  "I knew I hadn't been up there, so I called.  I asked them to look at
the ticket and describe the car.  Of course, it was some other car."
  Within days, notices began arriving from all over the state.  That
little light went on in Barbour's head.  He was getting tickets for cars
that did no have license plates -- the ones on which the traffic cops had
written "no plate" on the citation.  When the tickets went onto the DMV
computer -- and if the fine went unpaid -- the computer kicked out
Barbour's name and address.  Barbour says he has received about 2500
notices.
  Barbour, 39, and the father of two, said he wrote a form letter and
sent it every time he received a notice of a ticket.  Most of the time
he received a reply saying the matter was closed.
  When he was asked to appear before a judge, he wrote another letter
saying, "No, it's your mistake; look at the ticket and look at the
description of the car."  He said he has never had to appear in court.

The following article appeared in _Nature_ vol 321, 22 May 1986, p 373:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                     ABOUNDING HYPOTHESES FLOATED
Washington

To students at the California Institute of Technology, satire has seemed
the best way to express opposition to ... SDI.  Last month they held a
competition for the most "destabilizing, unworkable or incredibly expen-
sive" proposal to achieve SDI's goals.

The winner is planetary science graduate Greg Ojakangas.  His proposal,
estimated to cost $457 million, involves developing a genetically engin-
eered strain of pygmy hippopotamus.  Hippos would be fed on a diet en-
riched with suitable radioactive materials and kept in cages with cathodes
embedded in the walls.  A continuous flow of electrons neutralizes the
alpha particles emitted by the hippos' radioactive diet, forming helium
and making the hippos lighter than air.

In the event of missile attack, an "optically thick cascade of buoyant
hippos" rises to form a shield.  Upon reaching the "hippopause", the height
at which the mean hippo density (MHD) equals the atmospheric density, the
hippos would fan out, forming a protective ROOPH (Readily Operative Over-
head Protection by Hippos).  In his proposal, Ojakangas reckons the hippos
will remain buoyant for two days.  After that, they will float gently to
earth where they can be collected.

Second prize went to physics graduate student David Palmer, whose proposal
calls for splitting the Earth into hemispheres at the Equator.  A large
bearing allows the two hemispheres to be rotated.  When radar detects a
flight of missiles heading over the pole, large motors rotate the two hemi-
spheres 180 degrees in opposite directions.

After this manoeuvre, the eastern and western hemispheres have changed
places, and the missiles will land on the country from which they were
originally launched.

Other less serious scenarios suggested putting everyone in the US aboard
dirigibles (since "no dirigible has been shot down in 20 years"); erecting
a cardboard shield as the final layer of a multilayer defence (cardboard
is lighter than plexiglass); and using a series of lenses to focus the
ability of the Bermuda Triangle to make things disappear.

The Caltech competition was inspired by a similar effort at Cornell Univ-
ersity last fall.  The winning entry at Cornell proposed using a particle
beam of tachyons, the particles arising in certain superstring theories
which travel backwards in time.  This would provide a pre-launch destruc-
tion capability even after an attack had been initiated.

Many moons ago, literally, the etymology of `desperado' was brought under
discussion.  The most interesting suggestion was that it is a shortening of
`desesperado' which means hopeless.  Well, as it happens, I have just found
some good authoritative information on the subject.  In his fascinating book
_Our_Marvelous_Native_Tongue_ Robert Claibourne says that it first appeared in
the English lexicon ca 1588, which will be remembered as the year in which the
great Spanish Armada became somewhat less than invincible at the hands of the
pipsqueak British Navy.  The word `desperado' was borrowed directly from the
Spanish, it meant "desperate adventurer" (read "pirate"), and it was used by
the Spanish themselves to refer to the likes of Raleigh, Hawkins, and Drake,
gentlemen whom they despised heartily.
