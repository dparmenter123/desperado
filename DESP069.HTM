I have made a discovery comparable to finding my own toes:  there  is  more
to technical writing than cake mixes and reference manuals!  I am an ardent
home seamstress because of the limited imagination of the American  fashion
industry  when  it  comes  to womanly women (&lt; Rubens, &gt; Modigliani).  This
weekend I was running myself up a fetching  little  number,  and  carefully
following  the written instructions which typically say things like:  "With
right sides together, stitch from little circle to large triangle [markings
on  the  pattern].   Grade seams.  Clip curves.  Turn.  Press pocket toward
center front [pattern marking]." The basic idea is to assemble the  garment
by  matching  corresponding  pattern  marks  on the various pieces.  Sounds
obvious, but it can get  fascinating,  particularly  if  you  are  weak  at
visualizing  spatial  relationships.   The instructions must be exhaustive,
very terse, and very unambiguous.  I suddenly became aware of the high  art
involved when I read the following phrase:

        Matching centers back, stitch collar to collar facing.

Centers  back!   That's  almost  rococo!   So  I  immediately  thought   of

Subject: DEC Insiders Getting Out

The following is from the Boston Herald, June 24.  The author is Scott
Burns, who writes (very well and reliably) on personal finance, etc.
This is the complete report.

                        Digital could be riding
                        for a fall against IBM

More egg may soon be found on the faces of institutional investors.

In the wake of last week's debacle at Texas Instruments--in which the
company announced an anticipated $100 million loss attributable to
home computers and the shares dropped 25 percent in a single
day--some 230 pension and trust managers were left holdting 70.3
percent of TI's total shares ... and a lot of explaining to do to
their clients.

The same fellows might do well to ask why they are buying more shares
of Digital Equipment while Digital insiders are selling.

Here's the story:

According to Computer Directions Advisers, a Maryland firm that
maintains a data-base on institutional stock ownsership and trading,
some 309 money management firms own 77.1 percent of the shares
outstanding in Digital Equipment, the nation's premier mini-computer
manufacturer.  Indeed, they liked the company so much they added more
than a million shares to their holdings in the first quarter.

During the same period, DEC insiders were selling.  According to The
Insiders, a newsletter that reports on insider buying and selling, 15
DEC vice presidents sold shares during the last reporting period and
31 DEC insiders have sold during the last 12 months ... while no
insiders, NONE, have bought shares.

Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

In fact, Digital may be heading for problems as it confronts the
momentum and position of IBM.  Here's the problem:

DEC WAS SLOW WITH ITS PERSONAL COMPUTER.  The company that invented
interactive computing and the first "personal computers" long before
the Apple was conceived was "slow out of the box", according to Tech
Street Journal newsletter editor John Gantz.  He notes industry
estimates of more than 1,000,000 IBM PCs installed or on order by the
end of this year ... a massive lead.

How did that happen?

Adolf "Sonny" Monosson, founder of American Used Computer, an expert
in computer values, and now a DEC vendor, says "DEC's biggest problem
is its chart of organization.  In their matrix organization someone
has to convice everyone else that something is good to do.

"At IBM they had a senior executive tell two divisions,--not just
one--to produce a personal computer.  And they did it.

"With rapid technological change, the slowness of the matrix system is
damaging."

IBM management speed has become market momentum:  the current issue of
Ziff-Davis's PC magazine has 642 pages of advertising, the largbest
magazine ever produced.  The last record was set byu Vogue.

With more than 1,200 vendors of IBM-PC-related products, Goliath IBM
now has an army of Davids ... on his side.

DEC's MICROS HAVE RECEIVED A LUKEWARM RECEPTION.  In stores I've
visited that have the DEC machines, salespeople feel the DEC Rainbow
is overpriced.  Part of this comes from IBM's aggressive pricing.

Goldman-sachs' office equipment analyst, Barry Tarasoff, believes "IBM
is exercising its volume procurement muscle to depopulate the already
overcrowded field and discourage new entries."  For example, DEC tries
to sell its hard disc drive (a mass memory device) for $3,700, $1,200
more than adding one to an IBM.

DEC SOFTWARE MAY BE SLOW IN COMING.  While software writers are
falling all over themselves to write programs for the IBM PC because
they can taste the one million installed base, DEC can look forward to
no such developments.  Still worse, the word processing program DEC
chose, Select, is one of the clumsiest on the market and contributed
heavily to the failure of the Xerox 820, the last machine it was
bundled with.  (Significant observation: while visiting with American
Used Computer's Monosson I noticed something strange.  With a
warehouse full of DEC equipment, all their word processing was done on
Wangs!)

MAINFRAMES MAY BE COMING BACK ... WHILE MINIS LOSE SOME OF THEIR
GROWTH.  Throughout the late 70s, analysts worried that the rising
speed and power of mini-computers, i.e. DEC, Data General, Prime, and
Wang, could destroy the need for large computers.  Now, with IBM
providing all the tools to connect micro computers to its large
computers, the prospect is different:  Large and micro will grow ...
but minis may flounder.

To be sure, DEC won't be a replay of Texas Instruments' disaster in
the consumer market.  And their Professional 350 model, which promises
to put the power of a PDP-11 mini on a desktop, may set a new standard
for micros when it reaches the market.  But with pensions and trusts
holding 77 percent of the shares, and mutual funds holding still more
a sneeze for Digital, the company, will be pneumonia for Digital, the
stock.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Hmm.

Is the Rainbow supposed to compete directly with the IBM PC?

When *will* the Professional "reach the market"?  BTW, reliable rumor
reports 15,000 Professional sales, which comes out as $75 million.
That's nowhere near the predictions we heard back when all the Pro
people were eating regularly on their Diner's Club cards, but it's a
nice piece of money.  And total DEC micro sales are up around 60,000,
according to a less reliable rumor.  And we're real excited about the
Micro/PDP-11 here in Micro/RSX land.

Comments from institutional investors or DEC vice presidents welcomed.

Subject: The Silicon Valley Guy story

There's been a little mention of the book "Silicon Valley Guy" in a recent
Desperado, and some suggestion that one of the authors worked for DEC.

Not true.  The concept, in fact, was conceived some time ago by the
jerky-looking guy on the cover of the book, Bob Glazar.  Bob is an announcer
at a Phoenix radio station, KMCR-FM.  After playing with it a bit around the
station, he and program director Doug Myrland decided to cut a Moon Zappa
sound-alike record called "Silicon Valley Guy."  Doug and his friend Patty
wrote the minimal lyrics, and Bob did the voice-over.  Sales were interesting
but unimpressive from a profit-making point of view.  They also got sued by
Frank Zappa.

Nevertheless, Avon publishing contacted them with a deal, and Doug and Patty
churned the book out in about five weeks.  Inspiration was indeed influenced
by Digital:  Doug took an extensive tour of the Colorado Springs facility
before writing, though the photos came from a well-sold customer in Phoenix.
Doug even has his own EDT reference card.

It's cute, but getting out of control.  The book rights belong to Avon, but
Disney productions have the rights to the record.  And the movie.  It should
be out next year.

VMS Heavies, take note...

I've got a software tool which has a "Logging" mode, in which data
appearing on the tube also gets written to a file.  Although much of what I
want to write involves strange formats, most easily handled by having two
semi-redundant Fortran WRITE statements (one for the terminal, the other
for the file), there are also a lot of simple messages that I'm writing
with the VMS RTL system service Lib$Signal.

Lib$Signal is supposed to write the message to the terminal and also to
Sys$Error (which defaults to the terminal).  If I use the DCL ASSIGN
command to redefine Sys$Error as a filespec, Lib$Signal graciously writes
to both the terminal and the file.  However, if in my program I use either
of the system services that assign logical names (process table, either
user or supervisor mode), then call Lib$Signal, Lib$Signal ignores the fact
that I've just redefined Sys$Error and only writes its messages to the
terminal.  Sys$Error is really getting redefined;  I included a
translate-logical-names service call which verifies it.

Anybody know what I am (or Lib$Signal is) doing wrong?

Subject: Thanks for nothing, Dean Witter

Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. (whose television commercials are the
ultimate expression of the "I'm rich and you're not" chic so beloved
of supply-siders) is way off in its estimate of $425 million in DEC
PC sales for FY84.  Internal estimates of Rainbow sales alone for
the next fiscal year run to 140,000 units.  Multiply that figure
by even the price of the Rainbow 100 (the soon-to-be-introduced
100+ will cost more), and you go way over $425 million.

The ad for the Micro/PDP-11 was very well done, indeed.  DEC's print
ads have improved dramatically over the last few months.

A 50 percent employee discount for PC software?  Forget it.  I'll
steal my own, if I figure out a way to buy a PC in the first place.

                Exploring Space for Under $500

                        By S.Gordon

                Have you ever wanted to explore space but thought you couldn't
afford it? Well now you can. Yes thats right you can travel through the deep
regions of space at prices starting just under $500. This will explain how to
obtain the parts needed to build that all important space vehicle.

                You'll need a launch pad and metal (lots of it). You have a
launch tower to build , and a spaceship which will be refered to as  "The
Terrestrial Aid". You should be able to handle most of this with the aid
of a few of your most demented friends.

                To get the concrete for the launch pad you simply make a
phone call to our local construction firm to have them deliver a truck
load to your front yard. To avoid having to pay for this stuff you simply
use the name of the person who has the same street number on the next
street over from you. When the bill comes , cross off your street name from
it and write in the name of the next street over then cram that sucker back
into the nearest mail box. It will be years before they figure out what has
happened and by then you'll be on another planet.

                Next you have to start collecting metal for the tower and
Terrestial Aid. It would be nice if you could have this stuff delivered to
you door wouldn't it ? Well you can. If you think about it there is lots
of metal that just passes by your door each and every day. Here is how
you collect it. Off to one side of that road in front of your house you'll
dig a very large ditch (About the size of an adult african elephant). On
the other side of the road dig a pot hole , large enough so that no car
can get by it but small enough so they think they can. Very soon you'll
have more metal then you know what to do with. Your going to have to keep
that ditch cleaned out cuz people arn't going to drive past a pile of crumpled
VWs. Get yourself a chain saw so you can hack theese things into manageable
sections to be caried off and placed onto that metal mountain developing
in your back yard.

                Just about all of your guidance system can be made from
old TV chassis found at your local sanitary land fill. If you find
yourself short of parts you can always rip out the stereos and CBs from
all those junk cars you have collected. Instructions on how to turn this
heap of spaghetti into a real piece of equipment can be found in back
issues of Radio Electronics.

                How are you going to power your Terrestial Aid ? If your
like most people you don't want to pollute the atmosphere so why not pick
a fuel thats clean. How about vinegar and Arm and Hammer baking soda ?
You may wind up pealing the wall paper off every house in a ten mile
radius but you won't destroy the air.

                Don't forget to take food along with you !! You don't
have to order this stuff from NASA. Just go down to your local Kmart
and get one of those seal a meal dodads. Bring lots of beer , remember
there isn't much to do in an absolute void. Find lots of fun foods ,
you know , Rice crispies , Sreaming Yellow Zonkers , Peal a Meal ( dinner
in the shape of a sheet of paper).

                There are lots of other items one does not want to forget.
Oxygen might be a good thing to have. You can grab this out of any emergency
room, do it on a Friday night when they realy have no idea whats going on.
Well you probably have the idea by now. Soon you'll be wooshing through
the trackless void that was once the playground for large governments.
Bring a heavy jacket.  It gets cold out there.  Bon voyage!!!!

Subject: Long-ago-promised hard facts

Before writing this, I tried to think of a concise way to document the
exchange between me and SPIDER::COLLIER that led to the submission of the
data below.  Since establishing the relevance of anything in Desparado is
sort of a non-issue, I think it will suffice to say that a debate over the
origin of the expression "whole nine yards" led to some banter about the
capacity of concrete trucks:  the data below is in answer to some of the
issues that were rasied.   If you're interested in the background, see #1037
thru #1039; if not, enjoy the stuff below for its trivia value. (Sorry it
took me so long to get this long-promised info).

The source of this data is my dad, who in turn got some of it from:

        The National Ready Mix Concrete Association
        900 Spring Street
        Silver Springs, Maryland.       (301) 587-1400

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Concrete trucks with capacities of 9 cubic yards started hitting the market
between 1960 and 1965, and trucks with capacities up to 12 cubic yards came
out later in the 60's.   However, 7 yard trucks claim the most widespread
usage for the 60's, and 8 yard trucks claim the same for the 70's, as
indicated by the table below.

        PERCENTAGE OF TRUCKS IN USE VS. CAPACITY:

                -------- Capacity in cubic yards ----------
        Year    &lt; 7      7       8       9       10     &gt;10
        ----    -------------------------------------------

        1966    11%     38%     28%     12%      9%      2%
        1976     1%      5%     40%     27%     22%      5%

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The capacity of a concrete truck is only 59% to 63% of the actual volume
of the mixing vessel, i.e.,  a 9 cubic yard truck would hold 15 cubic
yards if stood on its front bumper.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The primary advantage of larger trucks is that more concrete is hauled for
the same labor costs.  Wages for drivers do not vary much with truck
capacity, and often do not vary at all.

The biggest obstacle to using larger trucks is load-limit laws.  (My dad
says that in Jefferson County, KY, that limit is 82,000 lbs.).  A cubic
yard of concrete weighs about two tons.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The average service lifetime of a concrete truck is 8 to 10 years.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

...My dad was quick to point out that this is considered trivia only by
those not in the construction biz.

How about this then?  In Chicago, most blocks have nine lots on them.
This means that when you run the length of the block, jumping over
fences, you have run the whole nine yards.  No?  Well, it takes nine
yards of material to make a wedding dress ... The record for the
flying leap is 27 feet, so ...  There are nine colleges at Oxford and
each one has a yard.  One who graduates from all the Oxford colleges
...  There are nine brickyards in Haverstraw, NJ.  The construction of
the Holland Tunnel absorbed the entire capacity ... Union Station in
Chicago serves nine different railroads, each with its own yards ...

About three miles ahead of me, I saw a car off to the side.  It was
