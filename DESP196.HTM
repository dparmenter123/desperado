    No, I didn't look at the documentation.  Hey, they're icons.  And
    anyway, the icons seemed to cover all the possibilities I could think

    Another bit of Gumby news is that a collection of new Gumby-related
    songs was recently released on Buena Vista records. It's a real mix
    of artists, with Frank Sinatra Jr doing the original Gumby theme,
    and contributions by Flo and Eddie, Dweezil and Moon Zappa, Brave
    Combo, etc.  The cover mimics the Beatles "White Album" cover - it's
    just green, with an embossed "Gumby" where the "Beatles" would have
    been. And the Flo+Eddie song is a great parody of psychedelic-era
    Beatles, but with lyrics about Gumby.

Subj:   For DESPERADO

Hi hi.  I thought you might like this for DESPERADO.  It's another in a
long string of things students write on exams, but often these are so
remote as to seem apocryphal.  This one is "closer to hand", since Sally
L. Jones is my youngest sister.  She's a PhD candidate at the University
of Toronto in Theatre Arts, and a T.A. in a drama course.  (She gave me
permission to send this to you.)

I finished marking my exams over the weekend--and got one late essay to
mark.  I thought I was done with this course.  It's sort of like having
to wash the dishes the day after a dinner party.  There was one good
quote from all my exam marking, however.  They had to identify a quote
from Sean O'Casey's "Cock-a-doodle-dandy"--an Irish play about the
repressive Catholic Church and superstition in Ireland.  There is a
character in the play called "The Cock" who walks through the stage
every once in awhile with bright plumage, etc., symbolic of the life
that is being repressed, etc.  The central character is a girl who has
been to England and returned. She is vibrant and lively, sensual, and
of course persecuted as evil.  The village is out to kill the Cock as
well.  They had to identify a speech by Loreleen (the girl) and discuss
its thematic importance. The student wrote how poetry and sex, and the
joy of life was repressed by the Church, and then said: "Loreleen is
O'Casey's mouthpiece for these views, and his cock is his symbol."  I
had to stop grading for awhile.  After 30 or so exams, something like
that can stop you in your tracks.

Re: Driver chews tobacco

The sticker in question is apparently notable in New England.  However, in the
western states (*not* Texas, which is another country, as stated elsewhere),
this particular sticker is common enough to be considered an optional courtesy
to other drivers, on the order of turning signals and working brake lights.

Some other potentially regional commonplaces include:

Eat lamb.  10,000 coyotes can't be wrong.

Montana (alternately Idaho, Wyoming): where the men are men and the women are,
too.

Montana (alternately Idaho, Wyoming): where the men are men and the sheep are
scared.

Re octothorpes:

The musical natural is not an octothorpe.  It only has two thorpes.  I
respectfully decline to suggest what the proper term for such a structure might
be.  The authors of recent discussions of appropriate plurals &amp; etc. will
surely have something to say.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I knew it was a duothorpe, but an insufficiently thorpe-minded person,
without my timely warning, might have mistaken it for an octothorpe.

"The grim reality is that every life ends with a death. Funeral homes
 exist to make that fact a little more tolerable. ... UNIX can help
 here, too. The Gordon Funeral Chapel, for instance, does much of its

 ... For example, Gordon says his system has to be able to classify two
 kinds of customer, "at-need," those who are actually deceased, and
 "pre-need," those who have made arrangements for funerals while still
 living. Moreover, the system has to be able to convert one kind of
 customer to the other as the need arises...."

Subj:   turbans, turbines, and a guy named Charles

I was in Israel for three months in early '76. Since it was 14 years ago
already and I never wrote any of this down before, some of the following
may be inaccurate, but it's what I remember.

After a month in Egypt I flew from Cairo to Amman in January, visited Petra and
Aqaba, then returned to Amman.

The ruins of Petra were the most extraordinary sight I had encountered up to
that time, more interesting than anything I had seen in Egypt. Petra was a city
sculpted out of the red stone of the sides of a chasm by the Nabateen Arabs
hundreds of years ago. The dozens of caves are framed by elaborate building
facades, carved right out of the rock. A few Bedouins still lived there,
tending goats. After a day of exploring, myself, a Big-Bird-like Canadian
ex-accountant, and another American climbed up to what used to be the treasury
building to watch the sunset beyond the valley. The sheer scale of these empty
"ruins" (as they are called), and the eeriness of being in the midst of a
vanished ancient civilization, brought forth in me such a profound sense of
timelessness and awe that I might have called it mystical, if I were given to
that sort of talk. It was a memorable occasion, at least.

We had decided to spend the night in one of the many unoccupied caves. Few
people were around in January (or ever, for all I know), and you could
basically wander as far as your courage and ability to negotiate trails in the
moonlight would take you.

After hours of shivering in my $10 "such a deal" Dutch army sleeping bag that I
had bought at the Amsterdam flea market, only to later discover that it was
only a sleeping bag liner, I gave up the charade and got up. Charles ("my
friends call me 'Charles'") the Canadian, whom I had kidded earlier about being
so overprepared, remained fast asleep in his fancy down bag. Soon Arthur, our
third member, was likewise awake from the cold. Charles woke up to ask what was
wrong, and soon he too was up, but not from the cold. Overprepared Charles
assembled his campstove and made us tea, then revealed a small bottle of
salvation in the form of a brandy flask. This early breakfast (it was only
about 3 am) got us through the night, thanks to his good preparation and
generosity.

After returning to Amman, Arthur and I split up with Charles and crossed into
the west bank on the King Hussein bridge (or the Allenby bridge, depending on
who you were talking to).

To get into Israel you had to apply for a 90-day pass at some ministry in Amman
and ask for permission to visit Jordan's west bank, which the Jordanians still
considered part of their territory. If you were dumb enough to request
permission to visit Israel, you were refused, though they gave you a chance to
get it right by allowing you to try again the next day. Of course once you
crossed into the west bank, you were effectively in Israel and could go
anywhere you wanted, since unlike the Jordanians the Israelis didn't
distinguish between it and Israel proper.

The Jordanians were willing to allow the few interested tourists to exploit
this technicality, to maintain the pretense that they still had some kind of
sovereign claim to the place. It was useful for us because it was the only way
to enter Israel at that time by land (Egypt was still the enemy). Also, you
could avoid getting an Israeli visa stamp in your passport. Such a stamp would
prevent you from travelling to most Arab states. They stamped it on a separate
piece of paper, if you knew enough to ask them. If you didn't, you couldn't
return to Jordan and had to fly out, usually to Athens.

After Jerusalem we headed for wonderful Haifa, Arthur's destination. He was
Jewish and had family there. I visited Tel Aviv briefly (yeck), and a couple of
places on the west bank about which I only remember a lot of dust. I headed
south, where I heard there was paying work, preferable to the kibbutz, which
mostly  provided only room-and-board. Hitchhiking was slow because drivers
would pick up the many hitchhiking soldiers first. In Sinai, I looked for a job
in Sharm el Sheikh, then stayed a few days at the old hippie hangout of Nueba,
famous for sand dunes, palm trees, naked Europeans and leering local peeping
Toms, though it was still a bit early in the season for much of that kind of
activity. Read "Tristram Shandy" in the dunes, rode a camel, and shivered away
each night crouched in a nook under some palms in my sleeping bag liner.

Nueba and Sharm are now under Egyptian control again I think.

Soon I was settled, relatively, in Elat, at the top of the Red Sea. There was
indeed work there. It was a grubby, dusty town which along with Sharm el Sheikh
was famous for skin diving. Aqaba in Jordan, where we had been a few weeks
earlier, was right at the other end of the beach, but the beach was split by a
nasty looking sand bunker and heap of barbed wire.

My first job was with the power station, which seemed to hire any passing
western bum who would do the work that the Israelis wouldn't do and that for
some reason they didn't want to hire local Arabs to do (maybe language
barrier), for about 80 cents/hr and a free place to sleep. I was very happy to
have the job, though I quickly learned from friends (and verified by my own
experience) that it was the worst job in Elat. The work consisted mostly of
digging while being yelled at. Once we spent all week digging to uncover a huge
pipe, being yelled at from above for not digging better while in ankle-deep
water (try digging in water sometime). We eventually made a tunnel and exposed
the pipe, to patch it with fiberglass wrapping and hot tar. At day's end we
were covered with prickly fiberglass particles, hot tar, mud, and of course the
usual ration of abuse.

But the place had its benefits. At Henry's Bar and the Peace Cafe, big bottles
of Nesher beer were 25 cents, and you could eat lots (mostly falafel) for about
two bucks a day. Most days I swam at the beach after work. You could swim
comfortably at all hours, the water was warm and gorgeously clean, and a few
fellow "beatnikim" were usually there too.

As in other countries with beautiful water though, few natives seemed
interested in swimming. Which always amazed me, since I grew up around Boston's
cold, rocky, crummy beaches. They took their swimmer's paradise for granted,
usually mumbling something about sharks, if you asked them. So when myself and
a like-minded Brit did laps evenings between two buoys at the beach, we usually
had the water to ourselves.

Benny the power station boss didn't like me much, other than as a target of
ridicule, so I didn't last long there. My last assignment was to go "clean the
turbine". He gave me a little pail of warm water and a hankie-sized rag, and
pointed me to the turbine room. Nobody was around - the turbine was the size of
a Greyhound bus, and I was supposed to wash it with this tiny rag!

I climbed on top - it looked perfectly clean to me, as turbines went. I noticed
the little plaque indicating its origin - manufactured by General Electric,
Lynn, Mass, USA - my home town! So, I laid back and did the only natural thing
to do under the circumstances. I fell fast asleep, secure on my hometown
turbine. Eventually I woke up, still nobody around, and returned to the office.
Okay, the turbine's clean now! Then I quit/Benny fired me in a noisy ugly
exchange, that somehow left no hard feelings, except I dreamed of murdering him
for many years after that, even though somehow continuing to think fondly of
him as an uncle.

People always seemed to be yelling at each other in Israel. But after a while
you got used to it, that's just the way they talked.

I remained in the apartment even after being fired, along with some others. It
didn't matter, we all knew each other and there was plenty of room. The
alternative was the beach which was nearly as nice, though not as warm.

Soon I got an even better job down at the port, loading provisions onto ships.
Every morning, day-labor candidates would gather at the Peace Cafe for our
morning coffee and sunshine. We'd wait for employers to come by and point to
"you, you and you". Most of the regulars were Euro-trash who had come to Israel
to be on a kibbutz, then left or got kicked out after discovering they were
expected to work for their keep. Several had been there many months, unable to
save enough money to leave, since they drank their wages away. Most of them
didn't have anywhere better to go anyway.

Two Arab brothers came by one morning, and picked some of us to go out on a
barge to load supplies onto a ship anchored in the harbor. The pay was great -
$1 an hour! We were paid in Israeli pounds, which I converted to hard currency
immediately each week at the local money changer, to protect against the
constant devaluation. One pound was worth about a dime then.

The brothers spoke Arabic, Hebrew and French, but no English. Since many of
their laborers were Irish/English riffraff, they couldn't communicate with them
other than by the usual method of yelling in Hebrew. I could speak some rotten
high-school French so was able to translate the brothers' more obvious
requests. The brothers were more good-natured than the grouchy Israelis at the
power station, what a relief. So we got along just fine, and after that they
picked me up every morning at the Peace Cafe.

One day one of our crew, a Dutch kid, got upset about his wages and started an
argument with one of the brothers at the Peace Cafe. This brother was quite
good-natured, though scarred and ferocious-looking. The kid lost his temper,
broke a beer bottle, and waved the jagged neck under the brother's chin. The
brother, rather than backing off, simply exploded in rage, and raced around the
low cement wall to strangle this twerp. The poor Dutch boy, not prepared at all
for this reaction, dropped the bottle and fled down the street, the infuriated
brother hot on his heels, to the encouraging cheers of the Peace Cafe regulars.
The brother was too old and fat to catch him, so the kid was safe as long as he
kept running. What a riot.

Most of the tankers we loaded were identical inside, and we soon got adept at
heading right to the provision area, in ships we had never even seen before.
Crews ate very well judging from the provisions, and always got a huge supply
of good liquor. Many of the crew members must have been permanently drunk.
A life at sea seemed the perfect career for an unrepentent alcoholic.

Unlike the tankers that came into dock to unload oil, many of the freighters
anchored in the harbor, so we went out to them on our barge and loaded the
supplies by crane. Pilferage was common. An Irish friend was particularly
skillful at finding the odd "open" or "damaged" case of beer. Nobody seemed to
care much, perhaps our crew pilfered less than most. We had rollicking times on
the barge some days, my oh my. It was a real improvement from the power
station. I liked the job and would have stayed - there was even a chance to get
seaman's papers, they said. But I wanted to return to Jordan before the 90-day
window closed.

We worked most weekends in the hotels washing dishes and such, to make more
money. I was able to save $150 in six weeks, and left Israel with more money
than I had gone in with. I felt rich. The Peace Cafe gang was shocked that I
was going into an Arab country after visiting Israel, convinced I would be
murdered if discovered.

Few of the foreigners in Israel had visited an Arab country in those days, and
most had wild notions about the supposed dangers. This was the pre-hostage era,
before the Iranian revolution. People seemed willing to distinguish between the
individual travellers who took the trouble to visit, and the policies of their
governments. More to the point, the concept of western-hostage-as-barter hadn't
surfaced. In general, the Arabs were much more friendly to me than the
Israelis, whose overall peevishness however was quite understandable. Even so,
the hospitality of the Arabs was a surprise, since I had never heard much
positive about Arabs in America.

I returned to Amman from Jerusalem on Easter Sunday, on the 90th day. I met
Peter Jennings on the rickety bus back over the bridge. He was with a cameraman
piled behind loads of equipment, and a blonde Icelandic (I don't remember how I
knew that) woman. Peter was quite friendly. He spoke Arabic to the Jordanian
border folks. They loved him. It was all so urbane, in the middle of these
junky customs shacks. What a cool guy.

I entered Syria uneventfully, though I think they smiled when looking at my
passport, which indicated that I had apparently spent nearly four months in
Jordan being a tourist. Which was ridiculous, since there just wasn't that much
to see there, besides sand. Of course they knew about the west bank trick, but
were perfectly gracious about it. Being young/naive/oblivious probably helped.

I never got to stay in Damascus, just roared through it in a truck, whose
driver was speeding to get home to Lebanon before nightfall. After dark it was
too dangerous, he said. I declined his invitation to join him.

The Syrians were very friendly, especially the officials I encountered. I spent
one night as a guest in a police station in Hama, after they picked me up
hitchhiking north. They didn't get too many Americans in those parts. It was a
little silly to hitchhike anyway, since public transportation was so cheap. The
first truck to see you hitchhiking would stop, and you'd negotiate some
trifling fee for a ride. It was even cheaper than the bus and more fun, if you
had the energy to not mind where you ended up that night.

I travelled light in those days. Light jacket, two pairs of pants, socks,
shirts, bathing suit, toothbrush, soap, hat, boots, wallet, passport, an
occasional book, and my lousy sleeping bag liner. That was about it. The only
thing I really worried about was staying warm, which I was unable to do on too
many occasions.

I spent about a week in Syria, mostly in Aleppo, which had the best bazaar I
had ever seen, before continuing on to Turkey on the way back to Europe. All I
had to do was get back to Munich before July, and I could use my return ticket
to the US. $150 doesn't seem like much, but everything was so cheap that it
really was enough. The (air-conditioned Mercedes) bus ride from Adana at the
Syrian end of Turkey all the way to Istanbul cost $6.25, for example, and the
ride from there to Munich was about $25.

But I didn't really want to return to the States, since I had no idea what to
do there anymore. Fortunately in Istanbul I met two Yanks who told me about a
place to work in Germany. Which I did, for nearly six months. I never used that
return ticket, in fact didn't get back to the States for another four years.

That fall I was right back at the same godforsaken Turkish-Syrian border again,
after joining a truck convoy from Munich to Saudi Arabia, for which I was paid
$60 plus food. I was the "driver" of a truck they were hauling through Turkey
on the flat beds of the other trucks. The truck industry was nationalized in
Turkey, so it was illegal to sell a non-Turkish truck there. To prevent this,
customs officials required one driver for each incoming truck whether it was
being driven or hauled, so they could stamp TRUCK and a serial number in his
passport, to be sure what went in also went out again. If you had a TRUCK stamp
you couldn't leave the country unless you had the same truck you had when you
entered.

I exited Turkey at the border to cancel the TRUCK stamp, said goodbye to the
real drivers, then walked back into the border shack as a truckless tourist and
got a plain entry stamp. I then backtracked to Ankara to continue on to Iran. I
got all the way to Teheran on the $60 before having to spend new savings again.
But I was loaded this time, (nearly $2000), and was heading east. I even had a
real sleeping bag!

That's a story for another day, but not quite the end of this one...

I bumped into Charles again, two years later, lounging by the pool of the
Malaysia Hotel in Bangkok. Unlike me, whose itinerary was mostly based on
getting to the next menial job, Charles, who had left Canada with his life's
savings, had not worked a day since I had last seen him. He had spent his
entire time wandering methodically through the Middle East, Afghanistan, India,

The latest issue of Algorithm has an ad for fractal stuff (videos, etc.)
from Art Matrix, the Cornell spinoff.  They sell by the "Free Market
System".  Here's how they explain it:

"If you pay the asking price for any product you are guaranteed delivery.
 Your order will be placed in the Privileged Queue and filled according
 to the date of arrival.  If you submit a bid that is lower than the asking
 price, your bid will be placed in the Free Market Queue and filled according
 to price and date tempered by our willingness and financial ability to
 fill it.  All bids are queued, including zero.  No bid is too low.  Free
 Market bids are not guaranteed delivery as newer higher bids will take
 precedence over already existing lower bigs.  If your bid is too low, you
 may never get your product.  However, the better we do during busy times,
 the lower we are willing to go during quiet times.  If you want the product
 even a little bit, definitely submit a bid.  You may be surprised.  You can
 raise or lower your bid at any time without losing your date seniority."

I don't think this will shake the foundations of the way the world
does business, but I thought it was a pretty cool idea.  Who woulda
thought marketeers would turn out to be hackers?

Say, Tom, I'll bet you could stir up some controversy about whether dove
is acceptable as the past tense of dive.  I don't like it myself, but I
think the battle's lost.  I'm not sure why I don't like it; probably
just snobbery, to be honest.  I do like stove as the past tense of stave
("A dead whale or a stove boat," to continue the Moby Dick theme), and
hove as the past tense of heave (in the nautical sense only).

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
My old city editor used to look disdainfully down his mammoth nose, an art
he had elevated to magnificent perfection, whenever he encountered "dove"
as the past tense of "dive", whereupon he would pronounce magisterially,
employing the long "o":

                "A dove is a bird."

He would also reply, upon being asked "Can I interrupt you?":

                "You already have."

I still do these same annoying things.

Organization: Intel Corporation; Hillsboro, Oregon

I ran across an interesting story in a local newspaper the other
day and thought it might be of interest to this group (on the
other hand it may be old hat).

Anyway the following without permission from the Oregonian, 1/16/90.

                        Green Magic for the CDs
                           by Wayne Thompson

This is a story about green magic. It is no old wives' tale, honest.

An anonymous audiophile tinkerer has discovered that the sonics of a
conventional 5-inch compact disc can be improved measurable by coating
the outer edges of it with green, indelible ink from a marker pen.

The phenomenon at this writing cannot be technically explained, but,
trust me and several other guinea pig listeners, it works.

I first heard about this trick six weeks ago. Dave Herren, owner of
Audio Alternative in Beaverton, called me to say that one of his
customers read about the green-marker test in an underground audio-
phile newsletter.

I was skeptical. Herren took the experiment a further step. He also
coated the edges of the inner circle of the disc with green ink and
conducted, in my presence, a test, using two discs of the same musical
performance - one with stock edges and the other with the green coating.

The results were stunning. The green-coated disc seemed to take away
the veiling that often accompanies digital music. Gone, too, was the
harshness often associated with digital software.

The music coming from the green-coated disc also seemed smoother and
clearer. Symphonies were glorious. Detail was precise.

The whole performance was more articulate.

Why? Who knows? As clarity improves, so does the apparent range of the
music, though I can't say if the green coating actually improves
dynamic range.

There are several theories about why the music sounds better when the
edges of a compact disc are marked with green ink. The most logical
one is that the green ink serves as a fence to keep more of the laser
beam's light contained.

The light from the laser beams in optical disc players is not completely
absorbed by the shiny metal discs. Much of this light bounces off the
disc and wanders into the space cavities inside the player. The green
coating may capture more of this deflected light, thus allowing the
laser beam to more effectively read the data on the disc.

Meanwhile, Craig D. Dory, president of Dorian Recordings of Troy, N.Y.,
has promised to find out what the green ink is doing to the laser beam
and to the disc.

Dory, formerly a strategic planner at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, is the
engineering brains behind Dorian, a compact-disc recording company that
is highly acclaimed by audiophiles.

Dory heard the green-marker test a the recent Winter Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas, Nev. He was impress. He said he plans to ask JVC
of Japan, the company that makes Dorian's compact discs, to run tests
on the green-coated discs to find out why it makes the music sound better.

JVC, Dory said, will be asked to experiment with colors other than green.

In the meantime, don't be too quick to coat your own disc collection with
green. As good as green sounds, Dory may find out in a few weeks that
blue is better.

Maybe there's room for one more much-delayed shot at the decade thing.

I like Walt Lamia's idea that the Gregorian calendar might have started
with the year zero (Desperado #2025), but I'm sorry, Walt, it just
don't hold water.  :-)  In the 6th century of the current era, when the
Gregorian calendar came into being, people in western Europe were still
counting with (depending on the individual's degree of literacy)
notched sticks, knotted ropes, counting boards, abaci, and Roman
numbers.  They had no concept of zero as a number and could not
therefore have used the number zero to identify a year.  QED.

However, if more convincing is required, let us not forget that the
current era didn't even start in the year 1.  It probably started in
the year -6, which fact would serve to confusticate all them 6th-
century dudes even further.  The following is from an article I wrote
in 1984 et seq. about the Star of Bethlehem.

                    First, it is necessary to establish the time
               frame in which we wish to look.  Strange as it may
               seem, Jesus was not born in the year AD 1.  An error
               in calculation was made during the conversion from
               the older Roman calendar, which dated events from the
               founding of Rome in 753 BCE,[1] to the present one,
               which dates events from the supposed birth of Jesus.
               This error occurred during the 6th century AD.[2]
               Jesus was born sometime from 7 BCE to 3 BCE
               inclusive.  These years are the extremes - most
               historians like 6 to 4 much better.  We shall
               therefore limit our interest to this general period.

               _________________________

                 [1] "BCE" is the term used by archaeologists to refer
               to times "Before the Christian Era."

                 [2] The conversion is believed to have been done by
               Dionysius Exiguus in AD 532.

So there.  Call your decade whatever turns you on, I guess.

    Now wait a minute folks.  You can talk about centuries and decades
    and millenia, and the 80's and when they all end, but don't go
    beating up ole Pope Gregory.  The Gregorian calendar definitely
    started on October 15, 1582 if you happened to be in a country
    that adopted it right away.  That date followed October 4, 1582
    by the Julian calendar.  That's definately when it started
    because Pope Gregory said so.  It's his calendar.  Mind you, not
    everyone in the world follows the decrees of the Pope, so there are
    people who don't use his calendar.

    Guess this is where separatation of church and state got a little
    confused, huh?  Has the ACLU filed suit to change the calendar?

Yep.  You got a problem with that, stranger?

Well, it's some parts of Texas.  You have to understand that there
have been some murders and other foul play associated with satanism
down there.  I have a female friend in Austin whose ex-husband was
involved with that stuff and sexually abused their daughter with it,
so it's a very real and very threatening thing.  And rural Texans are
not ones to sit around and complain when action can be taken - if you
get my drift.  If the storyteller had been a man rather than a woman,
the 'action' might have been physical.

====================

I'll add a bit more.  The writer of the story had nothing but contempt
for the two men before they ever said a word.  How very human it is,
alas, for us to condemn all cultures but our own.  The writer could
have had a very different kind of conversation with these men - if she
had had any respect for them.  The culture they represent has achieved
great things, and these men are not stupid.  (They are not the best
representatives of that culture, to be sure.)  We live in a
multi-cultural world, the more so every day.  It's time we learned to
approach other cultures with respect and curiosity rather than contempt.

Lyrics Server Help
------------------

The Lyrics server accepts 3 main commands, and 3 paramaters, as follows:

ALBUMS  - lists album titles and authors.
SONGS   - lists song titles, albums, and authors.
LYRICS  - lists lyrics, song titles, albums, and authors.

The 3 parameters serve to limit the output of the given command.

/ALBUM=album   - limits output to specific album
/SONG=song     - limits output to particular song
/AUTHOR=author - limits output to particular author

Examples:

LYRICS/ALBUM=Security
       - will list the lyrics to any album named "Security"
LYRICS/SONG=Shock the Monkey
       - will list the lyrics to any song named "Shock the Monkey"
SONGS/AUTHOR=Peter Gabriel
       - will list all songs by author "Peter Gabriel"

Multiple Paramaters are also valid, thus:

SONGS/AUTHOR=Peter Gabriel/ALBUM=Security
       further limits the output in the case that their may be more
       than one album by Peter Gabriel, and/or more than one album
       entitled Security

To determine what lyrics are available on the server, request
ALBUMS
with no parameters.

Requests are truncated to 1000 lines, so request accordingly.
If a request is too long, you may want to limit the request to
specific songs instead of entire albums.

Subject: Risks of Voicemail systems that expect a human at the other end

Last night my car had a dead battery (I left the lights on -- something
that a very simple piece of digital circuitry could have prevented, but I
digress), so I called AAA road service.  I noted that they had installed a
new digital routing system for phone calls. "If you are cancelling a
service call press 1, if this is an inquiry about an existing service call,
Press 2, if this is a new service call, Press 3."  All well and good,
except that when I finally reached a real operator, she informed me that
the towtruck would arrive "within 90 minutes."  In less than the proposed
hour and a half I managed to beg jumper cables off of an innocent passerby
and get the car strarted, so I decided to call AAA and cancel the service
call.

I dialed, pressed 1 as instructed, and waited.  The reader should realize
that my car was illegally parked (this is Boston), running (I wasn't going
to get stuck with a dead battery again!), and had the keys in the ignition.
I was not patient.  I waited about four minutes, then tried again.  Same
result.  I was now out of dimes, but I noticed that the AAA machine began
its message with "we will accept your collect call..." so I decided to call
collect.

Surprise!  I discovered that New England Telephone had just installed _its_
digital system for collect calls.  It is quite sophisticated, using some
kind of voice recognition circuit.  The caller dials the usual 0-(phone
number), and then is asked "If you wish to make a collect call, press
1...If you wish to..." Then the recording asks "please say your name."  The
intended recipient of the collect call then gets a call that begins "Will
you accept a collect call from &lt;recording of caller stating his name&gt;"

I knew what was coming, but I didn't want to miss this experience.  I gave
my name as something like "Russell, Goddammit!," and NETs machine began
asking AAAs machine if it would accept a collect call (which it had
already, plain to the human ear, said it _would_ accept) from "Russell
Goddammitt!".  Ms. NET (why are these always female voices?) kept telling
Ms. AAA "I'm sorry, I don't understand you, please answer yes or no," but
Ms. AAA went blithely on with her shpiel, instructing Ms. NET which buttons
to push.

I stood at the phone (car still running...machines nattering away at each
other) wondering who could do this episode justice.  Kafka?  Orwell?
Groucho? I was sure that one machine or the other would eventually give up
and turned things over to a human being, but, I finally decided to dial a
human operator, and subject the poor woman to a stream of abuse.  She
connected me to AAA, where I punched 3 (rather than the appropriate but
obviously malfunctioning 1), and subjected yet another underpaid clerk to
my wrath.

Regarding the amalgam used by practioners of dental science, your
readers may be less than stimulated to know even more about this
topic...but some may, in fact, finding it a "filling" topic.

The silver alloy and mercury are mixed ("triturated") in a capsule
that is shaken back and forth at high speed (like a miniature paint
can shaker).  There is a little weight inside that pounds the alloy
tablet into oblivion, and promotes its mixing with the mercury.

The mixture was, in the old days, placed into the prepared cavity with
the dentist's fingers.  Nowadays, they use a special tool.  The use of
fingers added moisture to the mixture, causing the filling to expand
out of the cavity over a period of years, causing marginal degeneration.
Once the margins break down, juices and dead food get under the filling,
and the little bugs go to work rotting your teeth, while you're
confidently brushing and flossing...

Since my previous life of several years at one of the country's more
corrupt dental schools, I understand that they have gone to
pre-packaged triturating capsules, though many DDSs still use the old
black plastic ones with a screw cap.  I still have mine somewhere in
my dental school junk, along with gutta percha points (made from
seaweed) for stuffing root canals and dried-up impressions of my teeth,
as they appeared some 15 years ago.

     Hubble Trouble Leaves a Sting

 The clean room at Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida is designed to
 keep even minute dust particles out. But the best high technology
 protections were apparently not enough to keep out nine wasps from
 setting up house in the air-tight special chamber where NASA is
 preparing the Hubble Space Telescope for a schedule April launch.

 The invasion of the insects posed a tricky problem for worker who did
 not want to risk damage to the telescope's highly polished mirrors in
 trying to kill the unwanted guests. James Carlock, Lockheed's program
 manager for the Hubble project, said wasp spray was out of the question
 because of the risk that the propellant might penetrate the telescope's
 protective covering. Eventually, five wasps were caught, while the others
 were found dead in the room.

 Recurrences of the problem were prevented just before Christmas when
 NASA personnel patched a hole in a conduit on the roof that apparently
 served as point of entry for the wasps.

 The problem is not a new one at this tropical south-Florida site.
 Kennedy spokesman George Diller said the Galileo mission was plagued
 by mosquitoes and the Magellan project by ants.

 At one point, frustated NASA officials employed the services of an
 entomologist who was asked to calculate the life span of a wasp
 unable to find food. The answer was 48 to 72 hours.

Subj:   Re: Desperado #2025: Let freedom ring

    John Train, a financial guru who writes for Fortune, has a series of
    little books on names.  The original one is called "Remarkable Names of
    Real People," and there are a couple of sequels with similar titles.
    Some of the names are similar to the ones in your dream, and all are
    alleged to be names of real people.  I recommend the books.  A couple of
    names I recall:

    Luscious Pea

    Some Middle Eastern sultan's name, which consisted of a few Arab names
    followed by about 100 repetitions of a single name (like Ali or Abdul),
    followed by a surname.

    Female (pronounced Feh-MAH-lee), the first name of a number of girls,
    particularly in the South.  The name is derived from hospital bracelets
    for newborns, on which a baby is referred to as Female Jones or
    whatever.  Apparently some number of undecided parents thought the
    hospital had assigned the baby that name and liked it well enough to
    keep it.

Not an urban myth:

The brother of a good friend recently spent some time (on business; he
works for a software firm) in an NYC hospital.  He saw a list of the
names of babies born there during the previous n months.  The names
included almost every drug dispensed at the hospital during that period,
along with my favorite, Nosmo King [insert last name], so named because
it was the last thing his mother saw as she was wheeled into the
delivery room.

I used to work for the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  The only name that
sticks from those years is Cinderella Muxworthy.

And, finally, will "Ivana" remain a registered trademark after the divorce is
finalized?  Who will get to use it, Donald or Ivana?  Will Ivana have to
change her name?

So, it's another Friday lunchtime and I've pared this one down to 1248
lines o'sparkle (and another stack o'sparkle sitting waiting for me in a
little old file we like to call NEXTDESP:2027.TXT) and that makes it time
to PIP this sucker out to the waiting world.  Best wishes to all and sundry
(you know who you are) and have a nice dream.
