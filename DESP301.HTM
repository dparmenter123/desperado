 &gt;In trying to save time navigating the web I guessed this url:
 &gt;http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/dejagnu/ and got a humorous message.
 &gt;I wonder if people at Microsoft can read http://www.delorie.com
 &gt;which works for me.
 &gt;
 &gt;Here is the message:

 &gt;If you are attempting to access this site from the Microsoft domain, you

 &gt;tired of the crap Microsoft peddles as Real Software and I'm doing my part

 No, I didn't write it, but I must say the installation of Windows95
 has made my system seem rather seedy and demode.

 Since we last talked, my CD has been dissed.  How come a machine
 that's certified on 3.1 is suddenly decertified on W95.  Just who
 deserves decertification here.  Certainly, W95 does not run 3.1 apps
 better than 3.1, not on the same hardware anyway.

 In Norway, the common water runabout is a 16-footer decked over, all
 varnished wood, with some kind of European two-cylinder engine
 thumping away somewhere inboard.  They're beautiful boats and I was
 idly speculating about how I could import one.  My friend the smart
 mechanic said, "If I lived there, I'd have one.  They sound neat, but
 if you live here (New England) you get a 16-foot Boston Whaler with
 a big Evinrude on it.  Buy what everybody else has because there's
 more of everything else out there for it.  They can fix it anywhere,
 get parts anywhere, sell it anywhere."

 It's the same with W95.  It maximizes my time spent sitting at a
 terminal to use W95 and to get the most out of it that I can,
 including spending what looks like $1500 on upgrades (not counting
 monitor lust), just so I can stay with the front side of the universe
 of computer users, both as one of them and also because the place I
 work sells to these folk.

 So, W95 is a disk hog and memory hog.  It's also so full of holes
 that a couple of pieces of $60 software can double both my memory and
 my disk.

 Be thankful for that.  Already the new interface lets me hide more of
 MicroSoft than ever before and I'm glad.  And it hasn't crashed once,
 although it won't install without beefing about some driver that *it*
 lost in the first place.  But I guess I'm glad I have it.
