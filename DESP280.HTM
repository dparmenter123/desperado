Judge Rules On E-Mail Privacy Case

TULSA, OKLA -- The Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled on a case that many
legal experts believe clearly delineates the e-mail privacy rights of
computer users in the workplace. Judge Stan Musing declared that employees
have a right to expect that their employers will refrain from monitoring
e-mail messages transmitted on company systems. The case went to court
after programmer Augustus Lindsey's supervisor monitored his e-mail and
intercepted a message from Lindsey to a colleague. The message read:
"That little sex kitten has been driving me wild. She's moaning and
begging for it every minute. Last night I was afraid someone would hear,
and we'd be thrown out of the building.  But don't worry -- all is
arranged. Wednesday she gets the knife." Lindsey's supervisor alerted
authorities, suspecting that a crime was in the making.

Lindsey was arrested on the spot and spent an uncomfortable night
discussing the situation with the police. However, he was released
in the morning, just in time to get his female cat to the vet for
spaying. Lindsey sued his boss for invasion of privacy and sought
punitive damages as well.

&gt; The kool thing about Clifford Stoll was that he was your basic sys
&gt; admin when he caught those spies and now he's a world expert.

Actually the really cool thing about Stoll is that he was your
basic sysadmin _who ignored the instructions_ that said "Do not
install movemail as root!" and then got caught.  In other words
his book could have been subtitled "how I was an idiot and deliberately
did was I was told not to and then spent several months cleaning up
for the consequences, to my eventual profit"

Sort of like Ollie North...

The googol homepage:

  http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/~fp/Tools/Googool.html

The author writes a program in C (which you can retrieve) that will
actually write a googolplex on standard output.

Following this is a proof, from two corollaries, that the program is
uesless, and will remain so for 564 years.

The parameter to the program is x in 10^(10^x)), the number it will
print.  He actually ran it for x=10 (much smaller than a googolplex)
on an HP workstation in about 10 hours (that a billion digits of
output per hour).  But the coolest fact is this:

He ran the output of the program into gzip (3 times), and it
compressed down to 1235 bytes.

 The googol is "a one with 100 zeroes after it", that is, "10 to the
 hundredth power".  A googolplex is "a googol multiplied times itself a
 googol times", that is, "a googol to the googolth power".  The googol
 was named and described in 1935  by Milton Sirotta, nine-year-old
 nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, who then built on
 Sirotta's  work to create the  googolplex.  Big times need  big numbers.

Subject: THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: C-

This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he
submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is
best described as a "low-level" programming language.  In fact, the
language generally requires more C- statements than machine-code
statements to execute a given task.  In this respect, it is very
similar to COBOL.

&gt; Me &amp; my sig-o could not come with any either, with the maybe exception of
&gt;Lou Reed.  For whatever reason, performing artists lose a certain
&gt;interesting edge as they mature.  Seems to extend to other musical forms,
&gt;artists such as  Muddy Waters or Billie Holiday peaked (IMHO) in their mid
&gt;thirties.  Maybe it's the stage lights? or the adulation?

&gt;Mind you, Some's dross is better than others best effort.
==========================================================

I couldn't agree with you LESS. Muddy wrote some of his best stuff
after the age of 35. Just a few examples, and his age at the time of
recording:

Hoochie Coochie Man (38); Mannish Boy (40); Trouble No More (40);
Forty Days and Forty Nights (41); Rock Me (41); I Got My Mojo Workin'
(41); Walkin' Thru the Park (43); She's Nineteen Years Old (43); My
Home is in the Delta (48); You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had
(49); Can't Get No Grindin' (58)

The above is not exactly dross; in fact, they're from his
greatest-hits collection: the Chess Box. And of course, those are just
the songs that Muddy wrote. He also kept recording other people's
songs, most notably Willie Dixon's, during his late 30s and for the
rest of his life. For example, here's how old he was when he recorded
the following:

I'm Ready (39); Double Trouble (44); You Shook Me (47); You Need Love
(47); The Same Thing (49); Bird Nest on the Ground (53)

Blues legend Howlin' Wolf presents an even more extreme example of
wine getting better with age. Wolf didn't even START recording until
he was 41 years old.  Some of his most famous songs, and his age upon
recording them, include:

How Many More Years (41); Bluebird (41); Mr. Highway Man (42); I'm the
Wolf (44); Smokestack Lightnin' (46); Who's Been Talkin' (47); Howlin'
for my Darlin' (49); Killing Floor (54); Louise (54); Don't Laugh at
Me (55); Commit a Crime (56)

Listen to that last one and you'll hear where heavy metal came from.
Again, Wolf made great records out of lots of other people's songs
(mostly Willie Dixon's) late in life:

Wang Dang Doodle (50); Back Door Man (50); Spoonful (50); The Red
Rooster (51); I Ain't Superstitious (51); Tail Dragger (52); Hidden
Charms (53); 300 Pounds of Heavenly Joy (53); Built for Comfort (53);
Dust My Broom (57); Coon on the Moon (62)

Those aren't exactly dross, either; they're some of Wolf's best
electric music.  He also recorded a few SPECTACULAR accoustic blues
during a session in 1968, when he was 58 years old. He still had the
fire at that advanced age. Listen my children and you shall hear....

The blues, and its bastard-child rock 'n roll, definitely IS a country
for old men. Have you heard Jerry Lee Lewis's latest record? It's hot.
He's old. Get it.  You won't regret it. He does a rocking version of
"I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive" by Hank Williams (27).

Back to lurk mode, with my milk toast and incontinence liner....

 Well said, Mark, it almost sounded like me.  I have a brief review of
 that very same Jerry Lee Lewis album in the works.  As for Lou Reed's
 "getting better", one must ask, better than what?  Billie Holiday did
 a bunch of stuff on Verve (and the famous CBS Sound of Jazz
 special/album) that would certainly cause your pal behind the &gt;s up
 there to redefine his definition of prime and what it means to be
 past it.  Indeed, these are the very albums with which I first
 seduced the gal who became and still is the little woman (Mrs.
 Desperado).
