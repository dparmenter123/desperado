I've been meaning to run some headlines for a while now.  My all-time
favorite comes from the Atlanta Constitution, telling of a football
game between two Catholic high schools:

                POPE PIUS BASHES BLESSED VIRGIN MARY

Another favorite, from a long-ago Desperado, also deals with sports:

                CONCORD-CARLISLE GIRLS FINISH ON TOP

So here are some more.

Station KZAP is still broadcasting from Sacramento, California.  Don't
know what the call letters stand for, but the station made its debut
in the late sixties.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
KZAP reminds me of the wonderful KFAT, the hillbilly hippie station in
San Jose, subject of the equally wonderful, but woeful, song, "There
ain't no KFAT in Nashville".  I'll bet there ain't.  KFAT don't play
no countrypolitan junk, they play real country music, all that outlaw
stuff, mixed in with Beatles and Grateful Dead, plus the more country
sounding rock groups.

WCRB not only means Concert Radio Boston, but also Charles River Broadcasting.
WTBS was sold by MIT to Ted Turner.  The new call letters for the MIT station
are WMBR - MIT Basement Radio.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Here's the first correct quiz answer on what KDKA and WFAA have in
common.  WFAA is in Fort Worth, KDKA in Pittsburgh.

If memory serves, KDKA is the only radio station east of the Mississippi
whose call letters start with K; it had a very early, and possibly
experimental, FCC license.  It's either in Buffalo or Pittsburgh.
Presumably WFAA is in the same town - or perhaps is the only station
*west* of the Mississippi that begins with W?  I am really dredging the
bottom of my brain, so don't blame me if all this is completely wrong.

From: HYDRA::YANKES
To:   ALIEN::PARMENTER

        I don't know what KDKA and WFAA have in common, but KDKA is
involved in two other bits of radio-trivia...

        1)  KDKA and KQV (another Pittsburgh, Pa. station) have the
distinction of being the only radio stations EAST of the Mississippi
river to start with the letter "K".  Both of these stations recieved
their call letters before the convention of "K" for west of the
Mississippi River and "W" for east of the river came into being. (I
believe there is one station west of the river starting with a "W",
perhaps that is the connection between KDKA and WFAA.  If that is the
answer to the "commonality" question, you are forgiven for not knowing
about KQV - it is just a small local station.)

        2)  WBZ claims to have been the first commercial radio station
in the world.  The truth is that they were second.  KDKA was the first
station and started its commercial broadcasting career with a broadcast
of the Harding-Cox presidential elections.  Sorry 'BZ...

        Speaking of KDKA - I know one of the original engineers that was
in charge of setting up the transmitters for the Harding-Cox broadcast.
(He still lives in Pittsburgh and is a close friend if my family.)  If
you Desperados would like, the next time I talk to him I'll have him
write down some of the stories of what radio was like back then and
send them out over Desperado.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I'd certainly be interested in old-time radio stories.  I didn't know
about KQV.

Channel 56 in Boston is WLVI, which is Roman 56.  Another Roman
numeral: WCVB means Channel 5 Boston.  WXNE means Christianity in New
England, as the ownership is some kind of religious outfit.
