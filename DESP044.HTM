Subject: re: our new facility in colorado springs.

I must compliment our counterparts in Colorado for their creativity in
selecting a new home. I suggest that not only is there some status in
saying "I work in the MINES" but they can also say "We are neighbours
with NORAD. We never worry about the START talks. We'll survive...."
And that they will really be able to carry on the tradition of
Digital, should Dr. Strangelove, I'm sorry Mr. Reagan (is this really
monitored?) have his way.

Who knows "MINING" may become a new vocation at DEC, we may have a
good use for the micro VAX yet, perhaps robotics to be used in
undersea silicon nodule mining.  DEC could say we don't only design
'em, we mine 'em....

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of personal interest:

Does anyone out there have a little canned proc to read a PR1ME tape
saved with a utility called MAGSAVE onto a VAX? The reason I am
interested is that I have be toying with the idea of installing the
little known (at least at DEC) PR1ME engineering program X.QUIP (Soon
to be coverted to QUIP-11 for VAX, of course).  his proc will read
thru a file of quips created at PR1ME engineering and marketing and
display one on the screen.  If there is any communal interest in this
sort of (humourous?) thing, I should be able to make it available for
common access.

Subject: Freeze-dried Teco

The new issue of the DEC Professional (a magazine by DEC customers)
has the following article originally from the Columbus Citizen
Journal, Nov. 4, 1982:

                Freeze-dried dog
               to get day in court

Isabell Burks wants to take her freeze-dried dog to court to use
as evidence in a malpractice lawsuit against a veterinarian.

Ms. Burks . . . is suing . . . for $5,771.19 in connection with the death
of her 10-year old Chihuahua "Teco."

The dog died April 13, 1980, after being treated twice on an emergency
basis....

After Teco passed away, Ms. Burks decided to preserve her pet's
remains by having the body freeze-dried.  "She was a little doll.
I just couldn't put that little girl in the ground.  She's much too
pretty to bury."

"I didn't want to take her to a taxidermist because they just cut off
the head, pull back the skin, and do their work.  Freeze-drying
is far superior," Ms. Burks said.  "You might think I'm a little fruity
for doing it, but she looks pretty good.  Not as good as if she
was alive, though."

Ms. Burks said she "went out and bought a plastic transparent terrarium
to keep the dust from gathering on Teco."

She charges in her suit that medication [Dr.] Kooner gave Teco
was inappropriate and that immediate surgery could have saved her
pet's life.  Kooner maintains Ms. Burks would not leave Teco
overnight at the Miffin Animal Hospital.

                        . . .

There's a moral in there somewhere.

Remember when I solved the Polish joke problem with "How many

        seven, one to change the bulb and a committee of six to

The following tidbits from the February issue of reason might be of
interest to Desperados:

    The Food and Drug Administration has proclaimed its
    official version of "truth" embodied in a government-approved
    list of words. Drug manufacturers who try to use words on their
    products that the average person stands a chance of understanding
    are subject to criminal prosecution and fines up to $10,000 per
    violation. The FDA rule states that labels on over-the-counter drugs
    must use technical language such as "allergic rhinitis" rather than
    "hay fever" and "antitussive" rather than "cough relief." Drug
    manufacturers, who contend the new labels will only confuse patients,
    surveyed consumers and found that only 15 percent claimed to know the
    meanings of the FDA's language -- and half of them were wrong. Sixteen
    persons thought an "antiemetic" was a person who disliked doctors, and
    one consumer described an "antiflatulent" as a bust developer. A
    medical magazine has described the FDA regulation as drug labels only
    Howard Cosell could love.

    The former mayor of Jersey City has written a book affectionately
    describing the good old days when the shenanigans of boss Frank
    Hague and his Hudson County crew made Chicago look like a League
    of Women Voters' convention. His favorite story concerns Barney
    Duncan, a yeoman Democratic party worker whose loyalty was finally
    rewarded when Duncan was appointed county commissioner of weights
    and measures. At Duncan's swearing in ceremony, a wise-guy reporter
    asked him, "Barney, how many ounces are in a pound?" Duncan replied:
    "Hey, give me a break, it's only my first day on the job."

Subj:   President Reagan's Visit

This week Jeff Rudy, Deb Buckley, and I had the honor of participating
in President Reagan's tour of the Roxbury Plant. After a long delay
(we, of course, had no idea of his stop at the Eire Pub!), the
President finally arrived to tour the plant. At the end of the tour,
just to the left of the podium, we had set up a "Ken's workstation"
complete with Pro 350. After long and hard instruction (!) in how to
push the DO key, Ken successfully had Reagan do just that. To the
President's surprise, 6 seconds later (yes, we counted them!), Reagan
saw a beautiful slide on the PRO which said" Digital's Boston Plant
welcomes President Reagan" followed by a beautifully done red and
black Professional logo on  Since Ken Olsen asked me "not to go too
far away", I had the privilege of shaking the President's hand as he
approached the PRO!

Mrs. Loeb, widow of the late William Loeb of the Manchester Union
Leader, was scheduled for a 1 on 1 interview with Mr. Reagan. Just
beforehand, she met with Ken Olsen. Following a brief session, I gave
her instruction on the CT. After I left the room, she left us a file
touting the greatness of the Union Leader! This was her very first
experience with a computer of any kind...a testimony to our ease of
use.

A number of people ran some incredible "fire drills" to make all of
this happen so successfully, namely Bob Reagan (how appropriate!), Iva
Briggs, Jim Dalia of field service, and Margaret Crowley. Also helpful
were Yolanda Boriskin, Susan Tata, and Andy Willinger.

The ultimate professional star,however, was our own Deb Buckley who
worked tirelessly with me to set things up and also to do a demo for
Channel 4 Eyewitness News.

A great day for Digital and its personal computers!

I'm still pushing the Marx Brothers as representatives of distributed

idea.  Charlie Chaplin doesn't mean anything as far as computers go.
He didn't even talk in his movies, did he?  In fact, his movie,
"Modern Times", is pretty much an attack on the IBM world view.  If
DEC did go with the Marx Brothers, it would really stick it in IBM's
ear.

Subject: 4341/VMS

Consider the following ad:

        The VAX super-mini-chip design at Hughes

A VAX-11/780 super-mini is being used at Hughes in a design automation task
(laying out IC's).  "They can think about the problem, and not worry about the
computer....  'Our people find VMS ideal for interactive computing.' [Hughes
manager] Tien says.  'As many as 40 design engineers make demanding use of
the VAX at once.  Response time is excellent.  The full-screen editor speeds
up programming.  And the executive language is simple, yet powerful."

One of our more interesting ads?  No, sorry - the text above is ALMOST what
it says.  In fact, the machine being described is an IBM 4341, and the opera-
ting system is VM/CMS.  (The ad is in the February Scientific American on page
40.)

"The 4341 super-mini"?  The 4341 is the top end of IBM's 4300 series, the "low
tier", if you will, of machines evolving from the 360.  Only the largest of
the 360's or even 370's would be in the 4341's class.  If that's a super-mini,
the word has lost all meaning.

Why is IBM calling it a super-mini, then?  The tone of the whole ad makes it
clear; this is a direct attack on a traditional DEC market, design automation,
and the attack is being made by claiming exactly the virtues for their system
that we have been claiming for the VAX.  They never once mention that the 4341
supports all the tons of 360-series software that is such a big selling point
for Big Blue - and with good reason:  THIS ad campaign is aimed at "engineer-
ing and scientific users", who don't want to buy a "commercial" machine.

You know what they say about imitation, I guess...

Subject: Buying a DEC PC at the local computer store

Saturday, I had an interesting experience.  A computer store near my house,
the Tech Computer Store, has been advertising in the Boston Globe that they
have DEC Professionals for sale.  Finding this a) intriguing, and b) unlikely,
I dropped by to check them out.

In the store, there was a large kiosk-type display labelled "Digital Personal
Computers".  There was room on three sides of the column for personal computer
displays, obviously intended for the Rainbow, DECmate, and Professional.
However, the only thing on display was a Rainbow (and an empty Professional
floor stand).  When I asked about the Professional, I was told, "We had one,
but it's gone."  (No further explanation.)  I was also told that they had sold
a few Professionals anyway.

I asked if I could try out the Rainbow, and the salesperson started up the CAI
course for the SELECT word-processing (I use the term loosely) software.
SELECT is really poor.  There are two main modes that it can be in, text entry
and text editing.  When you're entering new text, you can't back up a few
words and correct a mistake.  The only thing you can do is delete the last
character on the line.  To delete a word in, say, the previous line, you have
to get out of text entry mode, move the cursor to the beginning of the word
you want to delete, type D for delete, move the cursor to the end of the word,
and type ESC.  (Which is not easy to find on the Rainbow keyboard.)  Then you
can get back into text entry mode.  Inserting text, finding a given string,
and so on are all equally clumsy procedures.  And if you perform the steps in
the wrong order, you get into some indeterminate state which is difficult to
get out of.

The basic Rainbow is $3495.  I don't know what software you get with it, but
SELECT sells for $595.  There are apparently only about two or three software
packages available for the Rainbow, but the sales people expect more to show
up "sooner or later".  On the other hand, two different salespeople raved
about the Rainbow hardware, the built-in communication ports, etc.  They said
the Rainbow hardware was the hit of a recent national CP/M convention.  (My
only complaint is with the placement of the &lt;&gt; key, which is where the left
shift key normally is.)

Now comes the interesting part of the story.  The only other systems in the
store were various models of Apple.  (There was also a small, glassed-in
"training center" with several Apples.)  As soon as I expressed disappointment
in the SELECT package, the saleperson said, "Why don't you come over here and
let me show you Applewriter?"  I then got a very effective and informative
introduction to the Apple IIe.  Some of the main points:

The basic Apple IIe, with 64K, is $1995.  (If you buy a letter quality printer
for $900 more, they throw in Applewriter ($195) for free.)  The system has an
80-column monitor with upper and lower case letters, apparently an improvement
over older Apples.  It can be expanded to 128K.

The Applewriter software was a reasonably powerful, easy-to-use screen
editor, sort of like elements of EDT and Runoff in one package.  The
Applewriter documentation, and indeed all the Apple documentation I saw, was
excellent.  You could also buy Wordstar for the system, a somewhat more
difficult but quite powerful word-processing system.

As a matter of fact, you can buy just about anything for an Apple.  I got
shown a catalogue of the 16,000 Apple programs currently available.  I also
saw a sort of Top 40 of personal computer software.  Just about all of it runs
on Apples.  A much smaller percentage runs on IBM personal computers, with
even less available for Commodore and TRS-80s.  Other brands were essentially
unrepresented.  The top-selling business software was a file-management
package for Apples.

A major limitation of the Apple was its lack of communications software.  You
can buy both 300 and 1200 baud modems for Apples, but there is only primitive
communications software available.

The store has a walk-in service center for Apple hardware.  They claim that
most hardware is fixed the day it's brought in.

When I asked why the store sold only Apples, I got the following rundown on
their main competitors.

IBM PCs are not made by IBM, and are expensive, but not really that good.  IBM
is just doing an excellent job of selling its name.

Commodore has cheap base systems, but when you add in all the peripherals you
need, the price approaches that of Apple, and the quality is not as high.
Also, Apple has better software available.

TRS-80s are mainly for beginners and hobbyists.  The hardware is not up to the
standards of other manufacturers.

What it all boils down to is this.  I don't know how intentional this is, but
the DEC ad is basically bringing people in the door so that they can be sold
Apples.  The Apple is a nice system, and a good value for the money.  Unless
DEC can get its act together, we are going to sell more systems for the
competition than we are for ourselves.

Thank You Paine Webber.

On another note.  It seems that some Real Estate(Digital has its own
real estate department called RECO) type's job hangs in the balance as
a result of the presidential visit to DEC.  Apparently, the real
estate people were the initial contact for the presidential party when
planning his trip to DEC.

After the presidential liason was satisfied with the information that
was provided by this department the issue was taken to legal to settle
press issues etc.  The two corporate lawyers that were called in to
settle these legalities were so upset (personal pride) that they were
excluded from the previous closed planning sessions that they are
accusing the gentleman from real estate of not following corporate
procedures.

Funny thing about it is there are no procedures around that specifiy
policy for a presidential vist.

were talking about computers).  But that was last year, before Apple.

She loves it...claims the whole point of computers is to do the shitwork
so people have time to think.  I was amazed that at least one real-life
user believed that.  She did have some interesting observations:

1.      Her diablo printer has to have a different card to print output
        from her pascal programs than it does to print cp/m stuff.  they
        fixed it to print pascal and now cp/m is dead.  (this makes no sense
        at all to me...ascii is ascii i should think)

2.      She has spent a lifetime in fear of electricity...replacing
        lightbulbs causes trauma in her life...but yesterday she stoically
        plugged in an additional 16K of memory and said, "i didn't even get
        a shock"....she is VERY proud.

3.      (Put this in the advertising file):  She was watching a DEC ad for
        the Professional and noticed something immediately:  the terminal
        was low enough and angled so that people with bifocals (like herself)
        could use it.  She has to get far away from her Apple to see the
        screen.  She wondered if they did it on purpose (the person in the
        ad was wearing bifocals.)

Her final comment, before our conversation lapsed into gossip about people
we both knew:  It was a lot easier to get used to the computer than it had
been to get used to an electric typewriter after years of manual typing.

Another bumper sticker:

                I'D RATHER BE HOME COMPUTING
                              THAN COMMUTING
