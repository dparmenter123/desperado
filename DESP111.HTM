A friend of mine who is an intelligence officer for the Army Reserve
told me that the Soviets have indeed reverse engineered and manufactured
PDP-11s, but that so far they have not started manufacturing VAXs.
The complexity of the VAX seems to be a problem for them.  They could
perhaps make them in ones or twos, but no volume.  I think it is a safe
assumption to think that they have looked closely at a VAX, and understand
how it works.

It's interesting that the two companies where the Soviets have indeed
reverse engineered computer systems are IBM (system/360) and DEC (PDP-11.)
As far as my friend knows, they have not done so for DG, Pr1me, etc.

This info could probably be found out for certain by looking in the
articles and journels concerning Soviet society and industry.  I believe
much of it is publicly available.

Ingredients/instructions

Brown the following:

1 to 1 &amp; 1/2 lbs ground round w/
 chili powder - a couple of table spoons
 onions - 1 or two medium, cut in 8ths

Add:

v8 - 16 oz
refried beans - 16 oz can
whole tomatos - 28 oz can
tomato paste - 6(?) oz can
 You may want to add the refried beans after the v8, as its easiest to
 stir into the mess before adding other things.

Add peppers according to taste in chili - beware, my ratings may be a
tad conservative - I like the stuff hot.  I usually don't cut the
peppers into too small of pieces - leave big chunks, gives the stuff
more substance when done.  Smaller pieces tend to cook away to
nothing.

 red bell               1       1       1       1
 banana                 3       6       3       3
 jalopena                                       3
 red/green chyann                       3       3

Add:

garlic - two cloves - chopped.

Then:

beans (from dried pintos - NOT KIDNEY beans)
 I recommend dried pinto beans that have been soaked in water over
 night.  Use two cups of beans (before soaking).  If you use the
 canned variety, do not add the beans untill about two hours before
 this is done, as cooking the canned variety for 8 hours + will cause
 them to fall apart.

 For really abusive sorts, take a couple of Jalopenas and chop them up
 - boil in the water you intend to soak the beans in for a spell, then
 soak the beans as usual.  Watch out though, this will hot up the
 beans real well.

pickle relish - 1/4 cup, trust me.

Cook this whole mess for about 8 hours.  Enjoy!

Be carefull to simmer this on a real low setting - a large crok pot
works very well, but this barely fits in the larges of pots.  The
refried beans which are there to thicken up this stuff tend to burn on
the bottom if you're not carefull.   If you can't keep it from boiling
harder than just the minumim, stir it up every hour or so.

Subject: The REAL way to make chile

Sir,

What you have done to slander and demean the noble chile plant in your last
DESPERADO cannot pass unnoticed! I shall attempt to re-educate you on your
misplaced ideas on what constitutes good chile. I will also go farther:
I will challenge anyone who reads this to a chile cook-off, my time-tested
and wholly traditional NEW MEXICAN chile (we spell it with an "e" in these
parts, partner) versus your unspeakable and most foul abomination of a recipe
which obviously has its roots in the TEXAN "chili" which is uneatable.

        How, you may ask, can I say these strong words so very soon after the
publication of the recipe for this gross STUFF which has been so callously
named "chili"? (at least you got the spelling right.) The answer is too
simple. I looked at the list of ingredients and saw the word "BEANS" (Kidney,
at that!) right there in the recipe. Why, even the Texans who throw organized
"chili cookoffs" -- those folks without whom Terlingua would be known only to
a few drug-crazed peyote-seekers and river rafters -- specifically state in
the rules for their dishes, NO BEANS! No spaghetti, no pasta, no thickeners...
but especially NO BEANS! Not a single Pinto. Nary a Navy. Less Limas.

        Now, do not get me wrong... I, as a native New Mexican, have downed
far more than my share of the "musical fruit". It is impossible not to enjoy
the faintly nut-like flavor of a good Pinto bean, gently simmered until the
skin barely pops, then mashed and fried in a skillet to produce the brown
mass known as "frijoles refritos". And I confess to downing these little gems
swimming around in the juices left on the plate from a hearty dollop of chilE
(either red or green). BUT... I, like everyone from New Mexico, simply will
not cook these beans in chile. The title of your chilI explains so fragrantly
why.

        One more point to remember, chile is a vegetable, not a spice. It has
more vitamin C than an equal weight of citrus fruit, and more vitamin A than
an an equal weight of carrots. This is green chile, which is enjoyed in New
Mexico at every opportunity rather than its dried brother, red chile.
Unfortunately, green chile is unknown elsewhere.

        Now, to the recipe. This is the way New Mexicans make red chile.
It is really simple. Chile and meat are just about the only ingredients.
Take some meat.  Mixture of beef and pork is best, although either (as well
as venison, caribou, antelope, squirrel, or even chicken) works quite well.
Cut the meat into 1/2-inch cubes. Chopped or ground meat will disintegrate
into the broth, which is what you do not want. About three pounds of meat
will do, after trimming.

        Brown these cubes of meat in a skillet. During the browning, after
there is a little grease in the pan, add one onion, some garlic, and one
pound -- repeat, one POUND -- of red chile powder. Avoid things like "Carroll
Shelby's Chili Powder" or "Two-alarm chili mix" like the plague (which we in
New Mexico can also provide). Crush a teaspoon of cumin seed, and a teaspoon
of coriander, and add about one oz. of sage.

Add water. Let simmer for about two hours. The red chile will cook down, and
you do not need to add tomatos for color. If you like stewed tomatoes, do so
in another pot and eat separately.

        Serve with cheese (you got that part right), FRESH tomato chunks, and
crackers. You'll instantly regret it -- "good chile burns twice!" but will
never never go back to that insipid TexMex STUFF with beans.

                               CHILI ARGUMENT

              Wish I had time for just one more bowl of chili.

                                   - alleged dying words of Kit Carson

 Maybe the second quickest way to start an argument in Texas is to propose a
 recipe  for chili.  And not just Texas.  Steadfast Love and I have for some
 years disputed about the ontological relationship of beans to  chili.   (We
 are  both  pro-tomotato-ists.)  Steadfast thinks the beans go in the chili,
 and I hold the correct view.

 There are other controversies (see Bibliography below), such as whether  or
 when  to  skim  the grease.  Jane Butel, in Chili Madness, says "To skim is
 folly," asserting that the fat is an important catalyst in flavor.  The fat
 should  be  skimmed  only  after the chili is cooked.  Wick Fowler -- whose
 chili mix I use and recommend -- advocates  skimming.   He  also  advocates
 covering the chili during simmering.  Butel opposes covering on the grounds
 that "it inhibits flavor and texture development." I dunno bout thet  thar,
 but  I  don't  cover mah chili on account I like to fill the house with the
 fumes.  When the paint starts to peelin' off the walls, I know it's done.

 Anyway, this  isn't  really  a  recipe  but  an  endorsement  (unsolicited,
 unremunerated)  for Wick Fowler's "Two Alarm Chili Mix," which is generally
 available in supermarkets.  (I append, however, Fowler's original  recipe.)
 The  packaged  mix  contains  a few small, celophane packets of seasonings,
 dried onion, and masa harina (fine corn meal for thickening).  Some friends
 of  mine,  neither  of  whom are cooks, discovered the stuff when they were
 living in Texas and told me about it.  I've  tried  mixes  by  Pecos  River
 Spice  Company,  Carroll  Shelby  (same dude who did the Mustang 350 GT and
 other monster cars), and some others, but  Fowler's  is  the  best.   Costs
 about a buck and a half per package.

 According to Fowler himself, if you add only half the red pepper, it's  One
 Alarm;  all  of it, Two Alarm; all and then some of your'n, Three Alarm.  I
 usally make Two Alarm and Half a Scream.  Fowler says that Four  Alarm  can
 open sinus cavities unknown to medical science.

 Oh yes, the alarm scale has some scientific basis --  and  a  medical  use.
 About three years ago, a friend of mine was pregnant and overdue.  I made a
 batch of three alarm chili for her and  later  that  night  she  went  into
 labor, briefly, and gave birth to a bouncing, burping boy.  Last year, same
 thing.  But I made the chili a little milder, and she had a  longer  labor.

                         1. WICK FOWLER'S CHILI MIX

 INGREDIENTS

      2 LB Meat [see Notes &amp; Variations]
      8 OZ (can) Tomato sauce
      2 CUP Water
      1 Pkg. Wick Fowler's Two Alarm Chili Mix
      Salt to taste
      Cayenne pepper to dare

 DIRECTIONS

 1.  In a cast iron skillet pot (Dutch oven), sear the meat until  it  turns
     that grayish, half-cooked color.

 2.  Add the tomato sauce and the water.

     You can use just about any tomato-based product  --  even  ketchup.   I
     prefer a mixture of crushed or whole tomatoes and some tomato puree.  I
     don't like tomato paste for anything except axles.

 3.  Add all the other ingredients except for the masa harina.

     The other ingredients (from  the  package)  are  chili  powder,  cumin,
     cayenne,  dried onion, and so on.  Generally I add some more onion, cut
     into small pieces.

 4.  Stir occasionally.  Cover (per Fowler; leave uncovered per  Butel)  and
     simmer  for  an hour or more.  Skim the grease (per Fowler; not yet per
     Butel).

 5.  Mix the masa harina with water to  form  the  ideal  thick-but-flowable
     mixture.  Stir this into the chili to -- as Fowler says -- tighten it.

 6.  Simmer about another 15 or 20 minutes so that the masa cooks in.

 7.  Add salt to taste.

 SERVING

 Okay, beans.  Fine.  Just keep 'em on the side.  Beans do NOT belong in the
 chili -- with chili, yes; in chili, no.

 Accompany with a salad -- couple kinds of lettuce, some radishes, a  sliced
 avocado.   Also,  some  grated cheese, like a Monterey Jack or a very sharp
 Cheddar (such as Black Diamond).  Rat cheese is okay.  And maybe  some  raw
 onion for those with stable relationships.

 Beer, of course.

 Oh, yeah, there are probably some  psychobabbling  Californians  who  drink
 Ridge zinfandel with chili, but these people are not to be relied on.  They
 chat about their Cartier watches and the  Lebanese  immigrant  who  repairs
 their  BMW's  and  how many points they got on the last movie they did with
 George and Steve.

 Beer, I say.  You can hunt  around  for  Pearl  or  Lone  Star,  which  are
 somewhat  Coors-ish, from Texas.  Myself, a dark beer:  Prior's Double dark
 used to be a real bargain (and is about the  closest  commercial  brand  to
 Jacob  Wirth's  Special  dark, than which there is none better), but lately
 they put it in fancy-shmancy bottles, reduced to a four-pack, and jacked up
 the  price.   Also  Augsberger  Dark  from  Wisconsin.  San Miguel from the
 Philipines makes a good dark beer, and there are  couple  of  good  Mexican
 dark beers -- Negra Modello, I think one's called.

 NOTES AND VARIATIONS

 Some folks put sour cream on the chili -- it's  not  bad,  really,  but  it
 dilutes  the  effect.  You might keep some handy for non-Kosher guests with
 one-alarm palates.   Fowler  himself  says  that  buttermilk  is  the  best
 quencher (douser?).

 The meat can be all beef or a mixture of beef and pork.   (Also,  I've  had
 chili  made with venison that was excellent -- in fact, it was the best way
 I've ever had venison, which is otherwise a surrogate for Alpo.) You want a
 tough cut -- chuck, not flank steak -- that can stand up to the stewing.  I
 like to combine ground meat and chunks.  I read  somewhere  that  the  meat
 chunks  should  be  about  .45  caliber  (or the size of the tip of a man's
 finger).  If you're going to put any of the left-overs on  hot  dogs,  make
 'em about .38 caliber.

 Sometimes I put sausage in the chili --  hot  Italian  sausage  or  Spanish
 chorizo.   I understand that in Cincinnati, chili is a religon.  It's often
 served over spaghetti or macaroni.  I tried this and liked it --  Steadfast
 didn't, but she was still pissed off about the beans.

                   2. WICK FOWLER'S ORIGINAL RECIPE

 If you have real, fresh or dried chiles,  you  can  try  Fowler's  original
 recipe, as reprinted in The Great American Chili Book by Bill Bridges.

      3 LB Beef
      1 1/2 CUP Tomato sauce
      1 TSP Tabasco
      3 (heaping) TBS Chili powder
      1 TSP Oregano
      1 TSP Cumin
      2 Onions, chopped
      6 cloves Garlic (minimum)
      1 TSP Salt
      1 TSP Cayenne
      1 TBS Paprika
      12 (or more) dried Japones (very hot chiles)
      6--8 Chilipiquins (extremely hot chiles)
      3 TBS Flour (for thickening)

 According to Bridges, Fowler recommends  skimming  before  thickening,  and
 letting  it  sit  in  the pot overnight to be reheated the next day.  Chili
 does age well (even in the freezer!), rather like curry.

 BIBLIOGRAPHY

 The classic work is Frank X.  Tolbert's A Bowl of Red.  Recipes  and  lore.
 Must  reading  for  all capsicumphiles.  Fowler is one of the heroes of the
 book in a showdown with H.  Allen  Smith  that  started  the  annual  chili
 cookoffs.

 Jane Butel, head of the Pecos River Spice  Company,  wrote  Chili  Madness,
 which  lists  some  mail  order sources and gives a number of recipes.  She
 cites Fowler's mix, but  doesn't  give  the  secret  recipe  ---  which  is
 understandable:  Fowler's is her competitor.

 Bill Bridges, The Great American Chili Book is half recipes, half lore.   I
 think  it's  the  best  of the bunch.  It contains an interesting glossary,
 including such items as "WET SHOES," an order of french fries smothered  in
 chili,  as served at Chili West in Oxnard, California (although reported to
 have originated in Atlanta, Georgia).

 Martina and William Neely, The International Chili Society  Official  Chili
 Cookbook  is  a thorough collection of recipes (including H.  Allen Smith's
 boaster from the first annual chili cookoff.)

 Raymond Sokalov, in his Fading Feast has a chapter on chili  that  includes
 good recipes.  By the way, it's a good book on American regional cooking.

                       3. JALAPENO CORNBREAD

 This one is from the Times, I think.  If Steadfast  isn't  too  overwrought
 about  the beans, she makes it to accompany my chili.  She don't know beans
 about chili, but she's got all that weird baking  stuff  down  good.   ("Is
 there  really  a  difference  between baking soda and baking powder?" Sigh:
 "Yes, dear.")

 This stuff is a wee torrid, too, but  if  you  make  your  chili  mild  (to
 accomodate  the  wimps),  you can get your hots by soaking the cornbread in
 the chili.  Or, chop some of the jalapenos and the brave can  add  them  to
 the chili.

 Steadfast, mindful of my past misrecording of her recipes,  enjoins  me  to
 note  that  this  is  "quite  moist,"  but  she  hasn't told me what you're
 supposed to do about  that,  if  anything.   Probably  means  something  to
 bakers.

 INGREDIENTS

      1 CUP Cornmeal
      1/2 CUP Flour
      Salt, to taste
      1/2 TSP Baking soda
      1 CUP Cream-style corn (canned)
      1 TBS Jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (canned is okay)
      1 CUP Cheddar cheese, sharp, grated
      1/2 CUP Oil (corn, peanut, or vegetable)
      2 Eggs, slightly beaten
      1 CUP Buttermilk

 DIRECTIONS

 1.  Preheat the oven to 450 F.

 2.  Sift the cornmeal, flour, salt (if any), and baking soda into a  mixing
     bowl.

 3.  Add the corn, jalapeno, and cheese.  Stir to blend.

 4.  Blend the oil, eggs, and buttermilk.  Add to  the  corn-jalapeno-cheese
     mixture.  Stir to blend.

 5.  Grease (ugh!) an 8" skillet, and pour in the batter.

 6.  Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.

 NOTES AND VARIATIONS

 Any leftovers, if slightly stale, can be crumbled into the chili or used to
 make a very good stuffing for chicken.

 Canned jalapeno (like El Paso brand) is fine for this.  If you do get fresh
 peppers  --  Star  and  Stop  &amp; Shop carry 'em from time to time -- be very
 careful handling them:.  The oil is very caustic.  As you seed and chop the
 peppers,  don't  get  any in your eyes.  Later, wash your cutting board and
 knife well (or the oil will get on whatever you cut up next).  Also,  scrub
 your hands very well.  Once, after cutting up some serranos and jalpenos, I
 thought I had scrubbed all the oil off my hands.   Later,  I  went  to  the
 bathroom  for  other  purposes, and discoverd that there was still some oil
 left...  Uh, it got my attention all  right.   Nowadays,  when  I  have  to
 handle  such stuff, I use a pair of Steadfast's laboratory gloves or I wrap
 my paws in plastic sandwich bags.

        First of all, you don't need the ground beef.  Secondly, you don't
want to use taco sauce; make your own sauce.  Thirdfully, if you soak the

specifications.  Our architects, who had plenty of college, spent one
hell of a long time drawing up these here plans.  But nobody can think
of everything.  You should know what he meant even if it ain't shown.
So once your bid is in, that's it brother.  From then on, anything
thought up by our architect, or the engineers, or the owner's son, or
anybody else ('cept the contractor) shall be deemed showed, specified or
implied, and shall be provided by the contractor without expense to
nobody 'cept himself (meaning the contractor.)

        Our architect's plans are exactly right as drawed.  If something
is drawed wrong, or ain't figured right, it shall be discovered by the
contractor, corrected, and done up right without no extra expense ('cept
to the contractor.)  It won't cut no ice with us, or the architect if
you point out mistakes the architect or the engineers made.  If you do,
it's apt to be one hell of a long time before you do anymore work for us
or him (meaning the Architect.)

        In the two weeks he's got to bid, the contractor better find all
the mistakes the architect made in the three months it took to draw the
plans.  'Cause if he ain't got enough sense to know that the architect
is gonna think up a bunch of new stuff, then it's just too bad for him
(meaning the contractor.)

        If extra work is done without extra expense to the contractor,
then that work shall be taken down and done over again until there is
extra expense to the contractor.  Under this article, any contractor
walking around the job with a smile on his face is subject to review of
his bid.

        The contractor ain't supposed to make fun of the architect, his
sneakers and beard, his friends (even if they are gay) their plans, or
the work that they have done. None of the the contractor's men are
allowed to call the owner's son a wimp (even if he is) and they should
look busy when he's around, or he'll tell daddy (meaning the Owner.)  If
he does, (meaning the contractor) then it's just too bad for him
(meaning the contractor.)

Among the Methodists, the Cokesbury is the more rock'n'rolly of the
two official hymnals.  We used The Methodist Hymnal in morning church
- 'into the woods my Master went, clean forspent' - and Cokesbury in
the evening - 'We are standing on a mountain, underneath a cloudless
sky &lt;Praise God!&gt;' (Interjection from the men).  I loved evening church.

"Cokesbury" comes from the first two Methodist bishops, Coke and
Asbury.  The Methodists were always great singers.  Assistant founder
Charles Wesley wrote thousands of hymns, including 'Hark! The Herald
Angels Sing!'  (The Baptists, on the other hand, are great piano
players.  Ignorant people say that Bob Dylan invented the piano and
organ playing together, but this sound was actually invented in the
first Baptist Church that owed both a piano and an organ.)

About the Southern Hymnal: if not the south, how about the midwest?

We Midwestern and New England (United) Methodists also use the Cokesbury
hymnal (or "personal," as the choir members at my church started calling
it), of which I "own" two copies.  If NEILSEN would like to peruse it to
see if it has the required hymns in it (at least two of the ones mentioned
in his/her message are in this hymnal), I'll be glad to lend a copy.

If it meets the requirements, the hymnal can be bought or ordered from the
Cokesbury store on Boylston Street in Boston.

[Okay, Tom, do you remember where the name "Cokesbury" came from?]

The hymnal SOUTHERN HARMONY was derived from an even earlier hymnal
called ORIGINAL SACRED HARP.  Both hymnals are still in print!
Sacred Harp singing (also called shape note singing) is quite popular
in the Boston area, as well as other parts of the country.

You can find the hymnals in good music stores.  I got my copy of
Original Sacred Harp from Briggs &amp; Briggs in Cambridge; I don't have
Southern Harmony, but B &amp; B probably has that too.  Original Sacred
Harp was about $10.  Happy singing!

'Shape note singing' is so called because each note has a different
shape, making it easier for people who can't read music to sing.

Therry, I *too* have been searching for a copy of Southern Harmony, and went
so far as to call the Boston Public Library.  They have a copy up in the
Music Room (a very pleasant place to do research; I lived there for a while
when I did my senior thesis on, *gasp*, Mahler [enough to make other
students of musicology cringe].)  However, as pleasant as the surroundings
may be, the folks there can be a royal pain in parts of one's anatomy.  At
my last check, which was last year sometime, the Music research room was
open only two weekdays a week (9-5 Tues and Wed) and half days, or maybe no
days, on other weekdays.  What?  Open the research room on weekends?  So
that folks may continue their education on their own at their leisure?
Surely you jest!  (The situation may be better now, but I doubt it.)

Anyway, I went down there one day while I was on vacation, was able to get
my hands on the Southern Harmony, in a reprint that itself is now out of
print, published by Pro Music Americana, Los Angeles, CA, in 1966.  I think
it was a shaped-note edition (don't know enough about the Southern Harmony
to know if that's original).  Well, I was so excited I nearly dropped the
damn thing.  Why, this was the very source of thousands of lovely anthems
that I have sung in churches for years!  I looked through it and brought it
lovingly to the Xerox machine to capture a page or two (I mean, it *is* out
of print, and I just wanted to have them to study!  Really!) and the
Librarian nearly pushed me out of the window into the courtyard below.
Apparently they don't allow you to photocopy pages of books from a certain
collection (I don't quite know why, as photocopying a page or two for study,
especially if the book isn't available, I thought was Fair Use).  Well, off
she went in a huff, and I crept back to my table and copied a couple of my
favorites out by hand.  Nasty lady.

By the way, some of the songs are lovely things, but some are pretty
strange.

So, if you or anyone else hears of a new source for the Southern Harmony, I
too would love to get my hands on one.  Also, a Liber Usualis (also out of
print, I think, since chant was abolished) which has the melodies for tons
and tons of chant (maybe someone's raided an about-to-be-torn-down parochial
school or something?).

Thanks Therry and Tom,

Subj:   it's easy if you just do it the right way...

1. The best way to learn Japanese.

The best way to learn Japanese is to move to Japan, enroll in a good
language program, marry a Japanese girl who doesn't speak English,
move in with her family, preferably in the country, and stay there for
ten years. Study calligraphy, watch lots of TV (news and sumo are
good), learn how to play mah-jong, cultivate a taste for sake and beer
(not difficult), and use the public bathhouses. Don't speak English no
matter what (or else people will practice their English, which will be
better than your Japanese but will only make your learning slower).

2. The second best way to learn Japanese (in eastern Mass.)

Enroll in the Harvard extension school's night course. They have good
teachers, a language lab, tapes to borrow, and lots of cultural
connections. If you think the commute is too long, keep in mind that
it is after all more convenient than no. 1, above. I took two years of
Nihongo at Harvard and it was time well spent. And it's cheap!

If this is also inconvenient, use the notes files. You'll have more
than 100 simple words under your belt by the time you retire!
Actually, you could do quite well to buy the Jorden books and
accompanying tapes, but studying a language as hard as this without a
social context in which to practice is hard to keep up.

Knowing French and German won't help, except that the Germans put
their verbs at the end of their sentences too. Big deal. Cross
cultural word games will get you nowhere (ohio gozaimasu sounds like
...a zionist from cleveland !??  Arigato sounds like the Portuguese
obrigado but so what etc.)

Don't get discouraged - just consider it a ten year project...

There are eight notes files that I know about. I haven't explored all
of them, since they're pretty slow. They live in Japan.

1. Tokyo - about (you guessed it) Tokyo, my favorite town. Looks empty-ish,
with some 'Is Yamada's fruit shop still on that little corner in Shibuya?
I was there thirty years ago and got some great oranges...' type of stuff.
Type:  notes tkov60""::sys$notes:tokyo.not

2. Japan culture - the chrysanthemums bloom by the temple of the golden
pavilion, fried sweet potatoes, pachinko?
Type:  notes tkov60""::sys$notes:jpnclt.not

3. Japanese products - fillet of sperm whale's ear, supercomputers.
Type:  notes tkov60""::sys$notes:jswnotes.not

4. Japanese word processing - arcane engineering info
Type:  notes tkov60""::sys$notes:jwordpro.not

5. Japanese language processing - similar to 4.
Type:  notes jrdv01""::sys$notes:jwp.not

6. Japanese language - this is the one I look at. Lots of 'How do you
say "There is a motorman's glove in the goulash"' questions. Actually,
it's more like 'Here are five simple words' and 'I'm interested in
learning Japanese. How can I do it?' People who are trying to emulate
kana terminals use it too. This file has potential! The topic allows
for more give and take, because it addresses a group with a common
interest - learning to chit-chat in an exotic way.
Type:  notes tkov60""::sys$notes:nihongo.not

7. Japanese management - or, 'How to make your workers think they owe you
95% of their waking hours'. A great success.
Type:  notes tkov60""::sys$notes:jpnmgt.not

8. Japanese general information - intro
Type: notes tkov60""::sys$notes:welcome.not

Subj:   Eine kleine Tokyo nostalgia...

I lived in Tokyo for 2 1/2 years, from Christmas '77 to the summer of
'80. I feel like I know it better than Boston. I lived in Nogata,
Nakano-ku for the first year, then moved to Koenji-minami in
Suginami-ku, nearby. They are both about five minutes west of Shinjuku
on the Chuo-sen (the red express train).

I lived in a san-jo no heya (a three tatami room, 6' x 9') the first
ten months I was there. There was a famous (infamous) foreign ghetto
called Seiwah-soh, run by an old man who would rent to any crazy
foreigner or other disreputable type. I was a free-spirit then, as
were most of the others in the place. It was nicknamed 'the pit', and
the collection of european drifters and japanese musicians, students
and just plain nuts made it a great place to live, for a while.

But it wasn't really Japan so much as a kind of Noah's ark of
nationalities. So I finally moved out, after learning enough Nihongo
to convince a proper Japanese landlady that I was sufficiently
trustworthy to rent to. From then on I paid $90 a month for a
beautiful roku-jo (9 x 15) room. The pit rooms only cost Y6000, or
$30! It's a lot cheaper than Boston!

I taught English (of course), mostly in Tamachi, Shibuya, and
Sirogane-dai, at the J.Walter Thompson co. I earned enough money to do
what I was really interested in, which was karate. Do any of you know
the old karate dojo in Yoyogi? You can see the sign from the
Yamanote-sen train window coming from Harajuku, on the right side. My
teacher was a nana-dan from Okinawa. I practiced four to six times a
week for two years, and only got as high as yon-kyu! That's somewhere
between green and brown. Back in America, I've been to dojos whose
black belts would have been yellow belts in Japan. Higaonna-sensei has
since gone back to Naha, his furusato (hometown) in Okinawa. I hope to
see him again someday.

I met my wife at an outdoor dance festival in Koenji, the hachi-gatsu
awa-odori matsuri. The country really lets go in August - I think it's
the most fun month in Japan. The music and the dancing are very
strange to westerners.

Well, one thing led to another...now I'm a 'respectable' 9 to 5er,
looking back on all of that and sometimes wondering what happened to
all my friends back there and whether it all really happened...my wife
and I often talk about going back. But life is more complicated now!
One of these days....

Neil.
