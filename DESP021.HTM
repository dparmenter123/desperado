Starting with this issue, Desperados will be sequentially numbered.
My scatterbrained, ragtag ways are catching up with me and people keep
thinking they've missed one.  Actually, it just seems that way, but
sequential numbers will take the burden off me and put it on the
forwarders.

But seriously folks, most of you might never see Desperado if it were
all handled by me and good old KERMIT and ALIEN.  So, thanks to all
forwarders, best regards to all second- and third-hand subscribers,
and here come the numbers.

Since I have no idea how many issues there have been, I'm numbering
this one 1002 in honor of Shahrazad and the Thousand and One Arabian

On lines not to be believed...  The reason you can't believe what
the Playmate of the Month states as her preferences in literature,
as it were, is that the titles of her "favorite" books are often
supplied by my college friend Kevin Cook.  As an associate editor
at Playboy, he is regularly assigned to interview the playmate,
and since it often happens that she hasn't read anything, he fills
in whatever titles strike his fancy...which probably accounts for
the weird combinations like "The Other Side of Midnight" and
"Psycho-cybernetics."

And no, I can't get you a free subscription.

              DAVE REACHES UP AND MUNGS THE I/O PAGE

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: CASTOR::D_DONCHIN
To:   PARMENTER
Subject: Put this in your LCP-5 box and smoke it

Monday afternoon, Reid Brown, DECwest product manager, made a presentation
on a new project called Seahorse.  Simply put, Dave Cutler and company are
going to come out with the first implementation of the micro-VAX architecture,
about 6-months before the 1-chip VAX itself comes out of Hudson.  The CPU and
memory controller occupy two quad-height boards that plug into a Q22 bus.
This will then be put in an LCP-05 (Micro/PDP-11) type box with integral
10MB Winchester, dual floppy, power supply, etc.  6 remaining Q22 slots
will be available for the disk controller, memory, extra peripherals, etc.
It will be compatible with all Q22 products.  (For those of you who don't
know: Q22 is the 22-bit addressable version of the LSI-11 bus.)

Some of the statements Reid made regarding Seahorse:

        "A VAX at LSI prices, ($1600 xfer cost for board set)"
        "Fast, reliable real-time machine (about 11/730 speed)"
        "Early market presence (Q3'84, which to Cutler, means January)"

The two-board implementation is being done with almost all off-the-shelf
parts.  One big part of the processor board, the "data path" chip, is being
done in custom VLSI by "Silicon Compilers Inc".  All design work, etc., is
being done at DECwest and in the vicinity.  (This use of "DECwest" bothers
me; it's as if it were a separate company.)  When the microVAX chip comes
out, a one-board version will be produced.

The intended applications are:

        Dedicated processor for OEM applications (a VAX in your refrigerator)
        A personal workstation

The idea with microVAX in general is to compete with chips like the MC68000
which will eat up a large part of a domain we ought to be a part of.  Seahorse
gets us there earlier.

Projected MLP prices for various systems are:

        $14,600 - 256KB, RD51, RX50; Seaboard application system
        $20,000 - 1MB, RD51, RX50, Ethernet; VMS Personal Computer
        $28,700 - As above but with Aztec 50MB disk

Seahorse has an obvious impact on two products: Low Cost Nebula and Orion
(J-11).  It may make LCN somewhat unattractive, but can coexist with J-11
since the J-11 is better at doing many small tasks - Seahorse is better
at fewer but larger tasks.

Reid then went on to give a short overview of Seaboard as it is today.  It
appears that Cutler has backed off from trying to make Seaboard into a
general purpose operating system and is again concentrating on making it
a very easy-to-use method of generating standalone real-time applications
for small VAXes.  Using "SeaPascal" (by the way, the "Sea" in all this
stands for Seattle), you develop your program on a regular VMS system,
compile it, and link it with the Seaboard executive and RTL routines,
then copy (somehow) the resulting image to your Seaboard system.  You can
run the program under VMS with the Seaboard system services emulated or
debug it on the Seaboard system itself with a full-featured debugger
"SeaView" (!).

While Reid was describing how parts of the Seaboard multi-tasking and
multi-processing worked, he kept saying things like "Dave reaches up and
mungs the I/O page" or "Dave remaps the memory page", which caused me to
wonder out loud how they had managed to clone thousands of little Cutlers
and stuff one into each Seaboard box....   Anyway, it appears that Dave
is happy doing microcode for Seahorse.  (I wonder if the diagnostics are
called "Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent"?)

Some information on the HP 32 bit machine, culled from Business Week,
29-Nov-1982:

        The HP 9000 is a 32 bit machine, small enough to sit on a desk
        and priced as low as $28,250.  A comparable VAX starts at $84,000.

(I'm told the "comparable VAX" is an 11/750--the article I'm paraphrasing
doesn't say.)

        "Targeted initially at the CAD equipment market, which is now
        dominated by DEC, the new HP 9000 ''will have great impact on
        the way engineers do their work,'' claims HP President John
        A. Young.

        "The heart of the powerful desk-top unit is a VLSI circuit,
        developed by HP and unveiled in 1981, that leapfrogs the chips
        currently being offered by leading makers by cramming 450,000
        transistors onto a single chip.  By comparison, the most
        advanced 16-bit microprocessors being marketed by Intel contain
        130,000 transistors."

According to the article, HP will soon provide a local area network to link
HP 9000s together, and even connect them to a VAX or other central computer.
I have read elsewhere that HP is developing an Ethernet interface, so these
things may be Ethernet-compatible in a few years.

There's a picture of the thing included with the article.  It's not much
bigger than the IBM PC, with a system unit (with integral keyboard), and
a display.  There's fancy graphics displayed (which makes sense if they're
shooting for CAD markets), a printer (8 1/2 inches wide, looks like), and
a 5-1/4 inch floppy drive.  No mention of other mass storage peripherals.

On 'BCN this morning the culture vulture was reviewing a new book
called simply Words.

It is a voluminous publication with explanations of such favourite
esoteric phrases as "do wa diddy" and synonyms for the same.

One of the interesting points made during the review was
that the book contains 100 new (and rarley used) curse words!
Three examples follow:

- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of six
  words, the authour says then why not use the term "Big SIX" to
  enumerate your feelings towards troublesome animate or inanimate
  objects?

- There is another word which is Spanish (and sounds like a town or
  bar in Southern California) which means, when literally translated
  to English, "You have only one eyebrow!"

- A Canadian entry (which is totally unpronouncable), has absolutely
  no meaning, but sounds really lewd so they included it just for fun.

Subject: Bells and Whistles

Actually, the origin of this phrase greatly predates the advent of the
steam locomotive or, for that matter, the Industrial Revolution.  It
is a corruption of a lost Biblical phrase - lost because Gutenburg
inadvertantly dropped a page of type on the floor and couldn't be
bothered to reconstruct it.  Here's the story:

You may not know that there was a 13th apostle to Jesus.  There was;
he was St. Omar the Dyspeptic.  He doesn't appear in "The Last Supper"
because he was down the hall at the time.

In any case, after the Crucifixion, the apostles dispersed to spread
the word.  St. Omar chose to go to a backwards area (now Albania) to
preach to the Blottic people.  Now, the Blottics were a nomadic people
and also exceptionally stupid.  In fact, shortly after the arrival of
St. Omar, they packed up their tents for their annual move to higher
ground, but their leader was confused about East and West and as a
result the Blottics walked and rode into the Adriatic and were lost
to history.  St. Omar gave up the apostle business and became a
travelling representative for a Greek wine firm.

During his short preaching career, however, St. Omar displayed two
characteristics: his sermons were highlighted by a lot of handwaving,
props, and general flim-flammery; and he burped a great deal.  In fact,
his delivery was almost one continuous belch; and as a result, the
phrase "belched epistles" was applied to his efforts.  In a short time,
this phrase became associated with all the handwaving etc.  The phrase
was carried out of St. Omar's area shortly before the Blottic's last
migration, passed down for a few centuries, and eventually twisted
into the form that we have today.

The way I have been told, the original DEC-10 Son of Stopgap (SOS), was,
naturally, a later version of the editor called Stopgap.  Stopgap was a line
editor written for DEC-10's at Stanford some years ago, as a temporary hack
for people who tended to mangle files with good ol' TECO.  I don't know what
editor was envisioned as the "ultimate" editor for which Stopgap and SOS were
intermediates, or if it was ever built.

Stopgap was the predecessor to SOS.  It was an editor written as a stopgap
measure because the real editor wasn't ready in time to be released with
the operating system (I forget which one this happened to--TOPS-10, perhaps?).
When the real editor was finally released, they decided to call it "Son of
Stopgap," or "SOS" for short.

Well, RE: Son Of Stopgap, actually.

The story goes that in the old days of TOPS-10, all you could edit with
was TECO or something called LINED, which represented the opposite ends
of the editing spectrum. (LINED had about the power of your average
BASIC interactive editing -- if you don't like line #42, replace the
whole line).

Some American university (pretty precise, this, isn't it?) thought they'd
rather like something in-between, so they wrote their own editor and
called it 'Stopgap'. The next editor was, not unnaturally, called
'Son of Stopgap'.

Subject: CMS

The CMS I was referring to that ran on the S/360 mod 40 was CAMBRIDGE Monitor
System, the freebie version later released with CP/67.  When the whole thing
was repackaged and sold as VM/370, the name was changed to CONVERSATIONAL
Monitor System.  "Cambridge Monitor System" was no longer appropriate because
they moved the development team from the Cambridge Scientific Center to
Endicott, NY.

CMS is, and always has been, much more than a virtual batch system.  The
"virtual system console" is a timesharing terminal, just like on a VAX or
PDP-11.  Most of the other IBM so-called timesharing systems are really
interactive editors with a remote batch submission facility attached.  You
can't write interactive programs on them.  You can on CMS.

The amount of applications software, IBM- and third-party-supplied, that runs
on CMS far exceeds anything available for any DEC operating system.  The
Pro-350 is a much better machine, but it will have a lot of catching up to do
in the software area to match CMS running on a 370-based IBM PC.

I was greatly amused by your translated account of what the German phone users'
are up against.  In particular, the lady who denied that she had called "every
monkey in Africa" on Mother's day made this area ring with my laughter. (The
possible racism of the remark adds depth.  Also, is she implying that perhaps
the phone company thinks she is related to every monkey in Africa?  The phrase
"son of a bitch" pales in comparison.)

I have heard from a variety of sources that we've got it good in phone service
compared to the Europeans.  (Reputedly, no French president until until one of
the very recent ones consented to having a phone on his desk.)  Still, I have
this vaguely wrong feeling (something like the feeling you have when you smell
4 day old hamburger to determine if it is safe to eat) when I read about how
wonderful Bell is, and how responsive they are to customer problems.

Lastly, my guess is that I am not the only Desperado who was curious about the
association between the German phone system and the color yellow.  Is it
because of the yellow pages?  Or is it that they have a policy like Henry Ford:
You can get any color phone you want, as long as it's yellow.
