        This is one of *six* issues of Desperado slowly bit-rotting away
        in my special subdirectory.  If I am ever to get over the backlog,
        I am going to have to be *ruthless* in tossing stuff out.  So, if
        you've sent me anything in the past three months you may *never*

        There was an article in a recent Wall Street Journal wondering
        what's gonna happen when the KGB files are opened up to the
        world.

        One problem is what to believe:  "Suppose you see the Lee Harvey
        Oswald file.  How will you know you've seen all of it?  How do you
        know some of it wasn't made up while you were waiting for it?"
        Questins from an old CIA hand.

        Another problem:  "If we open all the archives, that will affect
        not just the relatives of the victims, but the relatives of those
        who perpetrated the crimes.  That could destabilize society."  From
        the current deputy head of the KGB.  I had to read that three times
        to realize that by "those who perpetrated the crimes" he meant the
        secret police, *not* the millions sent to the Gulag for "crimes"
        and that those millions were the "victims".   Topsy turvy.

&gt;From the Boston Globe:

Frank Forsyth, pursued early yesterday morning by Winthrop police for an
alleged house break, made a common mistake for suspects cornered on the
Massachusetts shoreline, according to coastal police departments.

He started swimming -- east no less, destined to pass through the Boston
sewage outfall long before he reached Europe.  In fact he got only 200
yards offshore before Winthrop Police Officer Michael Hickey nabbed him
from the town boat.

The first comment from the soggy suspect upon being dragged aboard and
handcuffed: "This is unfair.  You had a boat."

Well the time has come for me to jump from the tilting decks
of the Encore ship of fools as it heads for the warmer
waters of South Florida ("Gilda, Did you see the size of
that cockaracha?")

Things being how they is in the People's Republic of Perpetual
Unemployment, I have not, as yet, secured gainful employment
at a situation paying commensurate with my life style expenditures.
("Harry, come quick!  I think this man is a bum!")

Be that how it may, I have managed to assure my continued
association with right-thinking people everywhere by
employing the services of a unix whore, er, that is, a
public access UNIX _tm_service!  Beginning now, my Desperado
friends may find me broadcasting from Radio Free UNIX in
beautiful downtown Natick at the very heart of the Massachusett's
Miracle!  The address is:

        cook@unixland.natick.ma.us

This service is available (at a ridululously low rate) for all who
hunger for disclaimer-free networking by mailing bill (owner of the
486 system) at the same address.  And please do not make low-class
jokes about lotusland, disneyworld or the like!  Those of us in
the front lines of free speech have very sensitive feelings, doncha
know.

I trust the newspaper man will adjust my subscription to this
worthy journal accordingly and that Tom, our g2d b3y, will feel
free to give out this scent to anyone seeking our society

Subject:      Juggling - Just Say "No"

It can happen anywhere: a party, the recreation room, or sometimes even
in your local shopping mall. There's no easy way to tell them from other
people, the jugglers are everywhere. Remember if they approach you, just
say "no".

This is Paul's story:

"Well it all started at a party. It was just a local thing you know,
everyone was pretty drunk. Anyway, this guy, Peter, he seemed like a
pretty cool guy, he says "cmon through, see what's happening." Well
there was this whole room full of people, all juggling, laughing,
dropping balls that sort of thing. Anyway Peter handed me a set of bags
and said "here, you have a shot". Well I didn't want to look an idiot in
front of all these people so I had a go. Of course I dropped all the
bags. Peter kept encouraging me though, and by the end of the evening I
could almost do a cascade. It felt really great. Peter loaned me some
bags, and I started juggling on my own, I thought I could handle it at
first, you know, just the odd cascade and the occasional columns. I
should have realised then but I was getting pretty into it. They had a
sort of "club" going, they'd meet out of doors and do some communal
juggling. I saw some of the others with clubs, I was beginning to think
it looked pretty neat. I got more and more into it. By then I had a set
of balls at work in the office, I'd sneak out at lunchtimes for a quick
juggle. My parents were wondering where I was going every night, then
they found my diabolo. I was so ashamed. Thank god they found out before
I tried a unicycle."

Sergeant Grimes of the crack "Ballsup" squad had this to say at the
annual meeting of the Conservative Old Ladies for the Preservation of
Traditional Youth Pursuits meeting:

"Well I've seen it all. There's just no limit to the sort of things
these people will try. We've even caught a ten year old on a unicycle
juggling five balls. We've seen where it ends &lt;shows a picture of a long
time juggler&gt;. Look at him. His face is totally white, and his nose is
all red and bulbous, he even has to use makeup to show a smile. I've
seen these people begging in the streets and performing their "acts" in
public. Some of them even end up in circuses."

So be careful. Parents should look out for warning signs:

1. Unusually coloured balls lying about the room.
2. Strange thumps on the floor upstairs.
3. Clubs, rings, or diabolos.
4. Bicycles with a suspiciously low number of wheels

Between us we can stamp out this reckless craze. Be vigilant. Count the
number of wheels on passing cycles. Help stamp out juggling.

In the Associated Press, I read a story last week about protests and
demonstrations in Tbilisi, the capital of (formerly Soviet) Georgia, where,
as it happens, their first juggling festival was taking place.  (I would've
been there except for a back problem.)

The article gave much detail about the opposing sides and then this
section:

       ...
       In the interim, Rustaveli Prospekt - the main street of
    Georgia's capital - has the air of a surrealist street fair. Two
    opposition barricades, more symbolic than strategic, make it a
    pedestrian mall. Crowds in the hundreds, sometimes thousands, argue
    politics under banners for and against the president.
       At nightfall, political leaders detail their complaints against
    Gamsakhurdia, accusing him of maintaining socialism and preventing
    other countries from recognizing an independent Georgia.
       Now that television cameras have arrived, many slogans are in
    English.
       One unlikely streamer says: ``First International Juggling
    Festival.''

old Maine saying:

"You've heard of people who don't know nothin'? He don't even SUSPECT nothin'."

        With the arrival of that old favorite of mine, which I use all the
        time in my everyday work in the world's second largest computer
        company, the dumb contest is closed, at least until I get another
        good one.

        Bogus Records in Pittsburgh has released a Sonny Bono tribute
        album featuring "jangly, quirky modern bands" doing songs written
        by the Son One.

        I haven't heard it yet, but my band used to do "Needles and Pins".
        I'd love to meet the Mayor of Palm Springs some day just to tell
        him what a great song that is.  It's the first thing on te album.

&gt;From the Boston Globe

                        Condom Comment

AIDS activists yesterday inflated a 15-foot nylon replica of a condom on
the roof of North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms' suburban Washington home.
"A condom to stop unsafe politics," said the printed message. "Helms is
deadlier than a virus."  The protesters used two air blowers powered by
a portable generator placed on the home's front porch to keep the condom
inflated for about 15 to 20 minutes, said protester Peter Staley, 30, a
member of a group called Treatment Action Guerrillas.  We wonder if Macy's
invited them for Thanksgiving.

        A favorite Jay Leno line:  "National Condom Week.  Now there's a
        parade you don't want to miss."

                         AND SO, ONE DOWN AND FIVE TO GO

        Thanks for complaining about the dearth of Desperadoes.

        OH boy, was I *ruthless*.  I was *horrible*.  And then to cap it
        all, I wind up with a silly piece of mail totally out of context
        that couldn't possibly have survived true ruthlessness.  Of
        course, by the time you get the sixth one you won't even remember
        whether you ever sent me anything or whether I printed it or what
        and neither will I.

        Whupsy!  I just remembered I also have the special Christmas
        edition that I never got around to sending last year and had
        planned to send out July 4, which obviously I never did either.

        ah, wotthehell, as the cockroach said to the cat.

        Yr. bdy,

        PS - No Thanksgiving greetings because I foolishly think I'll get
        another done before then.  Of course, every time I send one out I
        get more stuff back, reminding one of the ship that can travel
        farther if it has more coal, but it takes more ship to carry the
        coal that . . . only one thing to say . . .
