The following memo was born in my office.  I am working on some
on-line documentation with lots of <b>highlighting</b>. On the VT100, VT220,
and VT240, it's just highlighting.  but on the VT241, the
white letters are green and the highlighted letters are <b>red</b>.

(Sorry about those &lt;ESC&gt;s putting VT52 users in the weeds, but that's
the way it is.)

And these aren't nice pleasant Xmassy, traffic-lightly greens and
reds, they're candy-apple tangerine-flake eye-gouger
lead-vests-for-the-pregnant electronic greens and reds, by which I
mean they're grotesquely effulgent.

TS1::CHASEN fled the office with a crazed shout and an incipient
headache and returned a half-hour later with this memo.

Subj:   My eyes.

Dear Folks,

I am red/green color blind.

This condition causes me certain problems in the day-to-day happenings
of my life.

For example, every time I have my driver's license renewed, a small
discussion ensues involving my understanding that traffic lights mean
"STOP" when they glow on the top or the left; except when stop means
they glow on the right.

Also, I find that indulging one of my hobbies, analog electronics, is
somewhat more difficult.  I have to keep an ohmmeter handy, as I
occasionally err in reading the resistor color code which defines its
value.

These are examples of restrictions on my life.  I am grateful that
they are minor, but I nontheless resist situations that add further
restrictions to me, especially if I think they are avoidable.

I am writing this memo because I believe that someone in Digital has
accidentally added a new restriction to my life. I may no longer use a
Digital color terminal unless the software overrides the default
colors.

You see, the VT241 terminal uses green as its base color and red as
its bolding color.

If all that this did was to cause me to not see bolded text, I would
not mind.  However, one of the manifestations of my color blindness is
that at certain intensity levels and/or specific frequencies, the
color seems to switch back and forth between red and green.  In order
for me to read the text on the screen that I saw without seeing a
stroboscope, I had to dim the terminal to an excessive degree.

I have noticed that people tend to be unaware of the effects of color
blindness.  It is hard to explain exactly what I see when I perceive
color; the only thing I know for sure is that my perceptions are
different from the average.  I also know that my perceptions are truly
different.  I do not perceive 'gray' when I am seeing red or green.
Sometimes I do not see the colors, but more often I will either mix
them up, clearly see them, or see them as other colors. The VT241
seems to land squarely in the 'mix them up' range.

I suspect that the engineer designing the terminal was simply unaware
of the effect he was having on my eyes.  But I still must ask the
question; why are we doing this?

We might want to provide a setup select for user control in the event
that the user wanted to default to a 'green screen' for example.  But,
it would seem to me that the software should in most cases choose the
color combinations. If the programmer did not bother to select a color
or colors, what is wrong with white and black as defaults?

Other color combinations are possible if we really want to show off
our color terminals when they are displaying ordinary text, but red
and green under any circumstances do not seem logical as a
combination.  They are contrasting colors; they should cause
uncomfortable reactions in people with normal vision.

My guess is that red and green were selected because they are two of
the three primary colors used to generate the color in a color
monitor.

I strongly urge that someone do some human factors testing of this.  I
believe that we are going to turn customers away from our products
with these terminals. Everywhere I go I keep hearing our marketing
people saying that they need color.   If a customer is attracted by a
demo from a color terminal, s/he will probably ask to try the
software. If red and green bother them as much as it bothers me, I
doubt that they will still be interested in buying our product after
using it makes them cross-eyed.

I suspect that nothing can be done about this at this stage. My
comment is that it seems almost inevitable at DEC that product human
factors testing is not seen as necessary until after it has been done
(if it gets done!).  At that point something relevant is always
discovered that makes the product far more usable.  I believe that
this product is unusable (at least for me, it is!).  I would like to
see the default colors changed in the next revision of the hardware. I
hope that barring that possibility, our software/operating system
groups can do something to correct it.

Sincerely,
Harris Jay Chasen.

About 10 per cent of all men and 1 per cent of all women are color
blind to some degree and three out of four of them have red-green
problems.  We found four color-blind people on 5-5 in about an hour.

After Harris came back with his color-blind crew, I was showing them
all the pretty and pleasant combinations of colors that the terminal
could produce, gold and charcoal gray and light blue, and so forth.  I
accidentally hit the Restart button on the world box (which is right
at chair height - these hardware designers must be asleep at the
switch) and the system rebooted with the red and green overridden and
the charcoal gray and gold replacing it.  It looked lovely.

Obviously the problem could be fixed in software, but the larger
question is why this ever happened in the first place.  There is a
fair amount of research on colors, and nobody recommends red for
anything except warnings of danger, certainly not for normal people to
look at every day and obviously not for color-blind people to look at
every day.

And, there's a larger issue of whether hardware understands any of
the expectations and capabilities of software.  For instance, if you
go into SET-UP B mode on a VT100, you'll find 16 bits that you can set
or clear to establish certain qualities of your terminal, but if you
think a program can send a 16-bit word to the terminal to set those
characteristics, or that a program could find out what they were,
change them and then change them back . . . well, everybody knows you
can't do it.

The VT100 has the equivalent processing power of three Athanassoffs
and five Mauchly-Eckerts combined and you could do the 1950 census and
the American Ephemeris concurrently with the processing power that's
in a VT240, so I think an ECO is easy and in order on this red-green
business.

Harris Chasen, by the way, has red hair and green eyes.

The designer who served as a consultant to the corporate identity
program (a/k/a the Chinese Reds) is color blind.

The 'ORANGE' of the VT241 is brown.

And, while we're still speaking of hardware versus software,

                        take the Aztec, please!

Subj:   Sign of the Globe

I remember you once suggested to me that the movie industry should replace
its rating system (PG, R etc.) with a summary of what might be objectionable
in the movie ("Three nipples, two knifings and one explicit sex act").  For
a long time, the New York Times has included a summary like that (although
not quite so enumerative) in movie reviews.  Now the Globe is doing the
same thing, with an added feature:  the reviewer evaluates the quality of
the objectionable item.  For example, "Heat of Desire" contains "considerable
nudity and simulated sex, usually joyless" while "Gabriela" has "nudity,
frequent simulated sex, usually sweet-tempered."  Which would you rather
see?

Subj:   DIGITAL Announces World's First Ground-Effects Computer

Well, it's not announced quite yet.  In fact, the design isn't even
finalized.  I'm working on something called the World Box, a packaging
scheme for micros whose chief distinguishing external features are an
oak top and brass casters. Apparently the design people have added a
skirt to hide the casters! Rumor has it that this was done because KO
didn't like them, or something like that, but I know the real reason:
to improve the machine's cornering performance.  It all fits: there's
even a fan in the bottom of the cabinet (one of three fans, in fact)
that's in a perfect position to draw air from under the skirt.  Now,
here's the proof: a buddy in the mechanical engineering department
told me that he had been asked to replace that fan in the drawings
with an ultra-high-RPM, high-tork cobalt samarium magnet model - 1.2
BHP @ 77,000 RPM, 387 cfm.  What's more, Digital has a secret contract
with Goodyear to develop a 55(mm)/40x1(in) racing tire in a slick, an
intermediate, and a full rain model.  (He said there might be a
similar-sized off-road tire in the works, but he doubts this.) Power
will be either 16 or 32 bit, with displacements ranging from 512K to
4M.  The as-yet-unnamed machine is expected to shatter lap records in
computer rooms all over America.  Secrecy is paramount because, it is
feared, the ACMS might ban the ground-effects technology before the
machine ever turned a wheel in competition.

Subj:   Some "snippets" of information picked up at the Piracy conference.
=========================================================================

1. Only 32 delegates turned up (how large is the computer software industry
    in this country?)

2.  By the end of next year there will be app. 0.25 million software
    products written.

3.  The computer market place is generally ill-informed about piracy.

4.  12 years ago about 2 million pounds was spent on the promotion of
    computers and their software. In 1983, 135 million pounds was spent for
    this purpose.

5.  It is possible to buy an IBM PC with 256k memory in this country,
    taking advantage of maximum discounts for 1,500 pounds. Together with a
    "software solution" package costing about 500 pounds, this gives a
    weekly cost for a computerised system of 15 pounds.

6. Integrated product sets, WP + Spreadsheet + database, are apparently THE
    coming thing in PC-land.

7.  Germany is expected to grow faster than any other European country,
    including the UK in the computer market place over the next 3-4 years.

8.  The WORDSTAR package has SOLD 800,000 copies, but there are estimated
    to be 3.8 million copies IN USE.

9.  Ashton Tate is now shipping 10,000 units of software a month, in 8
    languages, to 30 countries. They expect software prices to decline by
    42% per annum.

10. 6,000 companies are members of a manufacturing organisation called,
    Production Engineering Research Association (PERA).

11. A product called MicroSAFES, in the Manufacturing area, runs on 70
    different micros.

12. SAFE computing, a software company in the Manufacturing area, warrant
    their products error-free. Doesn't that blow your mind?

13. The Witford Committee, which reviewed the current legal situation with
    reference to computer software, used the Ladybird Book of Computers to
    appreciate computers and how they function (courtesy of Big Blue)!

14. A "new" abbreviation for you, American of course, MTBU - Maximum Time to
    Belly-UP.

I have been waiting impatiently for the end of summer to be in sight so that
I tell you all about the Nashua Choral Society! I'm hoping there are some
good voices out there itching for a chance to sing with us. I've recruited
a tenor and soprano for it for next year, and I'm very proud of myself.

The Choral Society meets once a week, Monday nights from 8-10, and has about
120 singers in it. Our director is James Johnston, an outstanding choral
director, and a super person. He has marvellous taste in music, and is an
outstanding musician. What's important about him is that he communicates
that musicianship particularly well, so that you become a better singer by
singing with him.

We're going to be doing several programs next year. The fall concert will
be with a chorus from Rome, and will include two of Verdi's four sacred songs,
and the Beatus Vir of Vivaldi. The Christmas Pops program hasn't been
picked yet, but in the past we've done rousers from the Messiah, some
beautiful Britten, and the Randall Thompson Frostiana. Our spring program will
be the Brahms Requiem, sung in English, and then a Pops concert in May.

There's also a smaller chorus, the Chamber Chorus, with about 24 singers in
it.

You should be able to read music moderately well, although I've found that
my sightreading has improved out of sight since I joined two years ago. Jim
is particularly interested in good first sopranos right now. The tenor I
recruited is a woman, so if you are another woman tenor, I can tell you
that they are welcome,and more than welcome, since we are always chronically
short of tenors!

Rehearsals will start the week after Labor Day. You will come to the first
three rehearsals and then have an audition. He's a terrific auditioner, by
the way , very supportive and understanding. He'll test you on how well you've
picked up the music, as well as checking your range, sight-reading, and testing
your ear on picking up tones played to you and singing them back to him.

Rehearsals are at Alvirne High School in Hudson. Be sure and let me know if
you have any other questions. I can tell you that it's a great group to be
with, lots of work, but much joy!

                    WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

Subj:   Timothy Leary Boots Up For The Future

        Timothy Leary is guaranteed to draw a crowd - or at least comment -
wherever he goes.  As featured speaker at the Boston Ad Club's recent monthly
meeting, he did both.
        The headline could proclaim `local boy makes good,' but that would re-
quire some elaboration.  As for his latest venture - very highly interactive
personal software - the jury is still out.
        Brought up in Springfield, Dr. Leary began college at Holy Cross in
Worcester and later transferred to the West Coast.  In the 1950's he was a
leading figure among humanist psychologists and later went on to fame and
scandal at Harvard in the 1960s when he became involved in experiments with
the psychoactive drug, LSD.
        ``To advertise, is to make public one's enthusiasm for an idea or pro-
duct.  I am here on behalf of products that I know will increase our intelli-
gence,'' he said.
        ``The brain is a perfect instrument, best understood as a collection
of 100 billion neurons - each processing like a personal computer.  And that's
a lot of Apples to be carrying around in your head,'' he said.
        ``If a human brain is perfect, then we have to look at a starving
street urchin in Calcutta and realize that his or her brain is better than the
best DARPA, or Fifth Generation Japanese, computer.''  He continued:  ``When I
look at the Ayatollah or Ronald Reagan I can also say, there is a perfect ins-
trument.  It's the programming that is screwed up.''
        He saw present trends in the information age as paralleling historical
trends in medieval Europe.
        At that time, he explained, ``there was a whole priesthood that con-
trolled the machine language called Latin.  Then along came an alienated hack-
er named Martin Luther.''
        And that, he said, happened to coincide fairly neatly with the devel-
opment of the `personal book' by Gutenberg.  ``Within 15 years of the develop-
ment of the printing press there were 10 million `personal' books circulating
in Europe.  At first people really didn't know what to do with their own
books, but before long peole were writing books and learning to read and de-
veloping the new ideas that led in a few centuries to the Age of Reason.''
        Now, Leary contends, we are in the third stage of the omputer revolu-
tion - the first being mainframes, the second being the personal computer age
(spawned largely by Apple's Jobs and Wozniak).  He believes this revolution
will be at least as profound as earlier upheavals.
        ``We humans are just on the edge of understanding this new age.  Thin-
kers and artists have been scared off by computers up till now.''
        As the previous revolution was spawned by the printed book, so too will
the next one be spawned by the software book, he explained.  ``Traditional
books aren't interactive, but a computer software `book' can be,'' he said.
        Leary predicted flatly that within two to five years most books will
be in the form of interactive software.  And that is what his new Hollywood
California based company (called Futique to contrast with the concept of an-
tique) hopes to produce.
        A one point Leary confessed that the concept behind Futique was only
six months old.  He also admitted that the actual implementation of the con-
cept by programmers is something he still understands imperfectly.
        ``What I'm trying to do with software now is no different from what I
was trying to do with the study of psychology in the 1950s or the use of psy-
choactive drugs in the 1960s.  After all, what's the difference between get-
ting high and booting up?'' he asked.
        ``In all cases I have fought to get rid of the capital "E" experts and
to put the individuals back in charge of their own lives,'' he added.
        Leary said that his first product, done to demonstrate the concept, is
an interactive version of Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn."  (He also noted that
1984 is the centennial year for that novel, and a member of the audience re-
minded him that Twain was an innovator in his own right, being the first au-
thor to use the newly invented typewriter.)
        In the works is SKIPy (Super Knowledge Interactive Program), an on disk
program that Leary hopes will become a combination friend, personal secretary,
and mentor to its user.  He suggested that by having the SKIPy set up as an ex-
pert system, and perhaps giving it a chance to sense your pulse and other psy-
chological traits, ``it could know you better than your best friend in two min-
utes.''
        Leary said he is trying to encourage friends such as William S. Bur-
roughs (writer and scion of the computer company family), Terry Southern (of
Dr. Strangelove fame), and others, to write software books through Futique.
        Leary also had kudos to distribute to others pioneering in various
types of interactive software.  In particular, he singled out "Participate",
an interactive teleconferencing system available through the Source and devel-
oped by Participation Systems of Winchester.  He also indicated that he had
met with representatives of Infocom, the Cambridge-based game software compa-
ny.
        ``There are tremendous liberating advantages in these [Participate].
For example, at the time of the 007 tragedy there was never more dis-informa-
tion put out by the government and media, but almost immediately, a conference
sprang up about 007 with all kinds of present and former government people,
pilots, and others involved discussing what could have or probably did happen.
At the time, with all the hysteria, it was almost the only place to get infor-
mation.  And as it turns out many of those things came out publicly weeks la-
ter,'' Leary said.
        ``Computer people, by their nature, are independent and thoughtful,''
Leary added, ``and I find this very encouraging!''
