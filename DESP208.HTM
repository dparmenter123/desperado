        I was reading one of those we-must-economize memos that are so
        much the fashion these days when I was brought up short by a
        demand for "emptying out all our vacant offices".  I was naive
        to think this was a naive statement.  Apparently, some
        understaffed groups fill empty offices so they'll appear to have
        a larger staff or to hide vacated offices from the authorities.

        silence followed.

        On the other hand, when he went to bed the night before the
        Iraqi invasion, James Baker was tired from a long hard day
        telling everybody what a great ally Iraq was.  And now he thinks
        Saddam is Hitler.  Might he not have been replaced by someone

helped me immensely at Zurich airport on Saturday.  Not being able to remember
enough of my 2 years of High School German to quickly interpret Abflang from
Abflung (or some sort) while driving, the accompaning diagrams quickly
helped me choose the turns between the Arrivals and Departure ramps.

Lookit, there is Not One Single Word in the entire Anguished Language
that has a "dge" combination where the vowel before the "dge" is
lengthened by it. Fudge, sludge, bridge, fidget, midget, widget,
wadget (for those of you who are Science Fiction types), you name it,
they're all short vowels.

THUS AND THEREFORE:

             If you wanna pronounce it "klooj", SPELL IT RIGHT.
                        THERE IS NO "D" IN KLUGE!!

(And don't give me those jerks at Webster's as an excuse, either. They
have no least notion of where the damned word came from, and I refuse
to accept them as an authority. Humpfh, so there.)

Photographs of "Kluge &amp; Jerstadt" printing press forthcoming, if it
isn't just a rumor that this is where the damned word came from.
First, though, I hafta get to where someone has such a press.
(Substance of rumor: the press, in operation, looks like it is in the
process of flinging itself apart insanely, and makes the observer to
laugh until sickness intervenes. I will believe this when I see one.)

Subj: What I did on my summer vacation...

Here is a summary of our vacation at a company-provided rented apartment on
the Southern Cost of Spain in Nerja. I am writing this in the hope that our
experience will benefit others.

The one and only warning we received about the Costa del Sol was watch out
for the crime, okay comming from the Cote D'Azur, and having grown up in
Manhattan this did not bother me, but I suppose people who go unprepared
are in for some nasty suprises.

The appartment is located in a modern hotel complex by the seaside boasting
beachside activities.

The first difficulty we encountered was getting to Nerja, we decided to fly
from Nice but the only convenient flights were 1 day out of synchronization
with the appartment rental, thus we had to rent a room at a hotel in Malaga
on our way  there and on the way back. We stayed at the Guada Del Mar, near
Torremolinos by the beach. This hotel although boasting `quatre etoiles' is
in a state of dilapidation and a price tag of 600ffs.

Next day we took the bus from Malaga to Nerja, for 50kms it took almost 2
hours in a bus that was straight out of the movie `Romancing the stone'. We
just lacked the chicken coops on the roof. Malaga was black with soot.

The bus route followed the coast line east of Malaga and offered splendid
views on randomly dumped garbage by the roadside, garbage that
was sometimes so malaodorous that your gagging reflex would be triggered.

When we finally arrived to "Marinas Del Nerjas" and the hotel our initial
room was on the interior of the "U" shaped hotel over looking a large kidney
shaped pool, from the room we could see an abandoned beach and a large number
of parasols adjacent to a kidney shaped pool. The pool and parasols were packed
with vacationers. -- I found it odd that people who have miles of beautiful
beach prefer to hide under parasols and in a pool -- bizarre culture. Well I
was wrong, as we raced down to the beach eager to plunge into the med. We came
to a screaching stop 3 feet onto the sand, quagmired in crude oil (or tar) that
was hidden just below the surface of the sand. So we backtracked to the pool,
where we discovered that despite it's depth of about 1.9m it was so soiled that
you could not see the bottom -- ugh.

Over a couple of days I felt less stupid about the tarring incident on the
beach, every newcommer to the hotel did exactly as we did, I think we observed
4 people actually bath in the med which incidentatlly is littered with
floating bits of toilet paper and other indiscribable items.

The hotel offers bottles of white spirit like detergent to remove the tar
from your feet when you return to your room. Thoughtful eh?

The only beach activity was sea-scooter rentals at 90ff for 15mins. No sailing
no windsurfing, nada. When the wind was right the fumes off the scooters would
waft over the parasols and pollute the air around the pool.

Well we did not get discouraged, we took our little Maheva tourist guide card
that was supplied with the appartment and pointed out that Nerja was only
1km from the hotel, well it's about 2.5km and you are obliged to follow
a road where traffic races at about 120km/hr.. so walking to town was out.
Last bus out of town was around 8pm so impossible to catch a bus after dinner
in town. The busses only operated every hour or so and were never on time.

With a little ingenuity we discovered the AVIS car rental agency in Nerja and
with the magic Avis wizard card managed to extract a tiny Opel Corsa from
them for the duration of our stay. The AVIS agent was polite and gave us some
hints as to what was worth visiting and what was not. We were mildy amused
by his reaction when we said we'd go to Gibraltar. The man said "Chez les
British Bleurk bleurk... sale British" Okay so no offense to any Brits that
read this... we had to laugh and just assumed that he didn't care for the
Brits.

Renting the car was a good idea because staying in Nerja was a good way to
go stark raving mad. We decided to visit Granada.  My dad told me it was
worth seeing the "old" moorish wealth, well we soon discovered that the
decent roads are all used by a tremendous number of very large very polluting
trucks -- this made for an unpleasant drive. 5 miles out of Granada we
were in bumper to bumper traffic, the traffic was almost exclusively
big trucks all sending plumes of stinking vapors into the atmosphere. Needless
to say the trip up included more scenic views onto malodorous garbage...

.... oh yeah, there was no "old" Moorish wealth to be seen in Granada only
some ruins (impressive) but grayed or black by exhaust and heavy industry
pollution.

In the interest of brevity, suffice it to say the reason Gibraltar is not
worth visiting, is that once you have gotten to the top of the rock, you might
see Africa through the mists but what you really see is that the rock is
littered from top to sea level with garbage. We took the "scenic" walk
down, saw some moth eaten monkeys that stared at us with baleful eyes
before turning away to weap there lost kingdom. Shortly after the monkeys
instead of taking the cable car we continued on foot, this was an
error because the foot path deteriorated into a gravelly walkway that was
littered with dog excrement and wound it's way through shanty slums before
rejoining the town.

The one highlight of our entire stay, was the visit to a town called Rhonda,
remarkably clean (except for the sewage dumped into the stream); Flamenco
dancers in the streets preparing for bullfights which were to follow the next
day. Near Rhonda the "Cueva de Pileta" was well worth the visit, featuring
Neolithic and Paleothic paintings, visited by gas lantern, for amateurs of the
game Adventure, this was as real as it could get.

All in all I think the CE was 'had' by the Maheva travel agency. In anycase
our vacation opened my eyes to the reality of pollution problems in under
developped countries. It made me wonder why Spain was granted membership to
the EEC?  Since my return many people have said I should have gone to
Seville, or Barcelona as I am sure there other areas that are in better
shape than the southern coast.

        will be in san francisco this october.  it was going to be in
buffalo, at a state-sponsored park for artists, but was cancelled as 'too
controversial' after a group called 'The Foundation For Decency Through Law'
complained.
        it will feature the largest tesla coil in north america, an
exact replica of a WW II buzz-bomb (ground-based, not flying), various
sexually explicit (and unnaturally gigantic) props, and the usual assortment
of diesel and hydraulic machinery.  it will also have the first  implementation
of a flocking algorithm in real machines, rather than as a mere
technique for animated graphics.
        the theme will be the ways in which sex and religion interact in
and with generally accepted value systems.
        i'm glad you liked 'Illusions of Shameless Abundance' last
spring; the video will be out soon, as will one of 'A Carnival Of
Misplaced Devotion: Calculated to Arouse Hostility Towards the Principles
of Order', which was presented in Seattle this summer.  Illusions and
Carnival were both pretty festive shows; i think SRL is entering a
darker Phase for the next few shows.

It was apparently cancelled because they were going to burn bibles.  Their
publicity poster here in San Francisco called for donations of bibles,
including Gideons' bibles "borrowed" from hotel rooms, bibles "borrowed"
from your church, parents, etc.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
How is it evidence of depravity and loss of worth of society that people
want to go around burning flags and Bibles?  It seems much more likely that
these "empty symbols" are, in fact, "quite full" and still have the power
to move us in strange and unexpected ways.

The following tells what it's like when you can't do "anything you want".
I'm not sure where it came from originally.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    The following, by one of Bulgaria's leading poets, was
    written before the fall of Todor Zhivkov last autumn:

    I know that my home is electronically wired.

    I cannot count on the installation breaking down from time
    to time as any other Bulgarian-made installation would.
    This eavesdropping system is imported, Japanese, top of the
    line.  Bulgaria is a rich country - it has more than enough
    wealth to throw away hard currency on such inventions of
    the contemporary super-genius of evil.

    And so it is.  I know all that.  I am an "eavesdropped"
    person.  I am gradually turning from Homo Loquens (speaking
    man) to Homo Ludens (playing man).  What games do I play?
    I play at blindman's bluff with gestures, drawing the most
    fantastic curlicues and patterns.  My husband and I have a
    well perfected sign language.  We understand each other
    with half a gesture.  This creates a special closeness
    between us, closeness of which many couples in a free
    country couldn't even dream.  Every day, every hour, I have
    an opportunity to admire the ingenuity of my husband, his
    witty air aphorisms, his gift of gesture, much more
    expressive than the trivial gift of gab.

    The ritual of our morning coffee is more elaborate than a
    Japanese tea ceremony.  in silent tete-a-tete we exchange
    hints and clues with elegant ballet figures of the hands,
    and often of the whole body.  in this pantomime we also
    include objects around the house.  When a new word is
    needed, for which we haven't made up a new hieroglyph in
    the air, we come very close to each other and my husband
    whispers in my ear the dangerous word, quite like people in
    love on their first date.  And I answer with a mysterious
    smile full of understanding.

    And our nights are even more intimately warm.  In the dark
    we use Braille.  I take his hand on his palm write
    warnings, reminders, question with my fingers.  Or we
    confide to each other something very secret with
    inarticulate speech.  Sometimes we have longer midnight
    dialogues.  The we use a different language, Samskrit, with
    newly coined words, understood only by ourselves and no one
    else in the world.

    If this night whispering sinks into deeper, more dangerous
    subjects, we bury our lips in each other's ears more and
    more often; we do this under the covers.  There, as under
    water, a part of the weight of reality is lost.  But if we
    strike a mine - some absolute taboo, which could cost us
    our lives - to deceive our eavesdroppers, we should at the
    top of our voices: "The day went quite well!  We worked
    with enthusiasm!  Good night!  Sweet dreams!"  And we fall
    asleep, our heads next to each other, happy that in the
    dark we understand each other with half a breath.  And we
    dream that we enunciate our thought articulately and
    loudly.  And horrified, we are jolted awake from this
    nightmare.

           A GUIDE TO PROPER ETIQUETTE IN THE MEN'S RESTROOM

Ever since man crawled out of the primordial ooze, he has built himself
structures to contain the processes of bodily waste removal.  These
have been known as "restrooms," "bathrooms," "outhouses," "commodes,"
"men's rooms," and several other names.  As with any exclusive
organization, wholy half the human race aren't allowed through the
door, and a number of exceedingly complicated customs have arisen to
maintain a sense of order and dignity.

General rules:
1.  Don't talk to somebody you don't know.  You may chat quietly with
    an acquaintance, but must absolutely not call attention to yourself.

2.  A quick glance in the mirror is permissable, but absolutely don't
    spend a significant time arranging hair, clothing, etc.  Zit popping
    is only permissable after checking to see nobody else is around.

3.  No profanity of any kind.  This is reserved for locker rooms, only.

4.  If you must wait, form a single-file line, ragged, and be sure to
    keep looking around.  Read grafitti.

Grafitti rules:
5.  All grafitti is anonymous.  If there's any chance somebody can trace
    your grafitti back to you, don't do it.

6.  Writing grafitti in the open section of the bathroom is only
    acceptable if nobody can see you.  Writing in the stalls is similarly
    acceptable.

7.  If the bathroom is sufficiently public, feel free to insult different
    ethnic/racial/sexual groups.  If the bathroom is used by a small
    few, restraint comments to amusing anecdotes or chit-chat about
    secretaries.  If visiting dignitaries from other companies or the
    government may tend to use the bathroom, grafitti is forbidden.

8.  Traditionally, all pictures feature women in various states of undress.
    Modern standards often include portions of male anatomy, discretely
    placed.  Homosexual grafitti is generally frowned upon but is
    gaining popularity.

9.  Pictures must only be drawn in toilet stalls.

10. Any sufficiently interesting graffiti will be painted over by
    the management of the bathroom.

Urinal rules:
11. Given a string of unoccupied urinals, you must choose one on the
    outside.  When one outside urinal is occupied, use the other side,
    then middle.  Avoid standing directly next to somebody at all costs.

    For example, given seven urinals, here are acceptable configurations:
    X......    (X == occupied, . == empty)
    X.....X
    X..X..X
    X.X.X.X
    XXX.X.X  &lt;--- These are only acceptable when significant
    XXX.XXX  &lt;--- "privacy" dividers are available.  If the
    XXXXXXX  &lt;--- urinals aren't divided, use a toilet.

12. Always look at the wall.  Looking down means you're obsessed or don't
    know what you're doing.  Looking at other people is threatening.

13. Flushing is optional.  Over time, the water will become a rich orange.
    At this point, flushing is mandatory.

14. Don't start unzipping until you're protected by the privacy of the
    urinal.  Don't step back until you've closed your pants again.

Toilet rules:
15. Reduce noise at all costs.  Grunting is not acceptable.

16. Always flush.

17. When you find an unflushed toilet, leave it alone and use another.

Special cases:
18. Some university dormitories have co-ed bathrooms.  New rules apply
    for dealing with the females.
    a. Never, ever, comment on how they look in the morning.
    b. Don't ask what the little wastebasket is for.
    c. If urinals are present, only use them when absolutely no females
       are around.  If you are noticed by a female, try your best to
       ignore her presense until you're dressed again.

19. Port-O-Let's and similar constructions are evil.  Use them only
    if absolutely no other option is available.

20. In the woods, far from civilization, restrooms typically aren't
    available.  Get behind sufficient growth that you are completely
    invisible to the remainder of your party, before you begin.
    Check carefully that you aren't near any sort of animal or
    insect den.  Ants are especially bad.  If you forgot toilet
    paper, bring a leaf identifying guide.  Poison oak makes
    a poor substitute.

   The following is among the stupidest true items I have ever read.  I
challenge all of you to document the behavior of a less intelligent
driver.

   To summarize:

   - The fellow is four-wheeling off-road at 4:00 AM.
   - He decides to cross a railroad track.
   - His Blazer gets stuck on the track.
   - The next half-hour is spent trying to rock the truck off the
track.
   - He spots an oncoming freight train.
   - Can't decide whether to jump or stay with his truck.
   - Stays with the truck.
   - Is hit by a 2 locomotive - 207 car freight train.
   - Survives with bruises.
   - Is happy the train is not damaged.

   Please don't judge all Pennsylvania drivers by this 4x4 enthusiast.

   From the September 6, 1990 Pittsburgh Press:

   MAN INJURED AS 4-WHEEL-DRIVE FAILS ON RAILS

   Robert P. Tandric said he didn't think there would be much danger if
he drove his 4-wheel-drive Chevrolet Blazer over railroad tracks in
Westmoreland County.

   The 52-year-old Saltsburg, PA resident said yesterday he
didn't think many trains still used the tracks.

   "I thought it was safe.  Evidently it wasn't, Tandric said yesterday
in a telephone interview from his hospital room at Presbyterian
University Hospital.

   Tandric's vehicle became stuck on the Conrail tracks about 4:30 AM
yesterday and was struck by a freight train heading from Pittsburgh to
Harrisburg.

   He is in fair condition in the hospital with what he described as "a
little bit of bruises."  He said he expected to be released today.

   Tandric, the owner of a pizza shop, said he enjoyed riding his Blazer
through rough roads and hills.

   He said he was driving for about two hours early yesterday when his
Blazer became stuck on the tracks.

   Tandric said he tried to rock the vehicle back and forth to get it to
move.  After about a half-hour, he saw the train coming.

   "I didn't know what to do," he said.

   He said he thought about jumping out of the Blazer, but decided to
stay inside, thinking he could get the vehicle off the tracks.

   The train - consisting of two locomotives and 207 cars - struck the
right side of the Blazer, knocking it off the tracks.  The train stopped
after the impact and a crew member called an ambulance.

   "I feel lucky now that I'm thinking about it," he said.

   Conrail spokesman David Neurohr said Tandric was trespassing on
railroad property.

   "Railroad property is for the operation of freight trains and is not
a venue for walking, jogging, or four-wheel driving," he said.

   Tandric said Conrail officials visited him in the hospital to check
on his condition.

   "Apparently I didn't hurt the train," he said.

   Trespassing charges have been filed, but Tandric has other problems.

   "I'm hearing it from my wife and my two daughters," he said.  "I'm
getting some flack now."

I just received a sample copy of a monthly paper called the Funny
Times.  It is a 25-odd page newspaper full of comics and humor
by the likes of Dave Barry, Lynda Barry (no relation), Tom Toles,
Andrei Codrescu.  Lots of alternative comics like bizarro.  Looks
like it has been around for a while.  Subscription is:
        $17.50 for 1 year, $28.50 for 2 years.

Here are two of the pieces I really liked:

Study Uncovers new facts in Savings &amp; Loan Scandal
                                by Judy Maclean

SAN FRANCISCO (FT)--White males headed failed savings and loan
institutions in numbers far greater than their proportion in the
general population, according to a new study published this week.
The study also found that heading a failed thrift is linked to
possessing a home and using multiple credit cards.

White males make up only 39.8% of the American population, yet they
comprise fully 88% of the officers who drove savings and loans into
bankruptcy, according to researchers from the National Institute for
the Research into Crime Origins.

The research team says it is now looking for some cultural factor that
would lead so many white men into this pattern of anti-social
activity.

"We're looking into family dynamics here," says Fred R. Kighsquair,
Ph.D, co-author of the study.  "There may be some subtle pattern in
white American childrearing practices that is giving young white males
the message that they can only win the approval from their peer group
by spending very large amounts of other people's money."

The Institute's current research centers on possible pathology in the
two-parent families where a majority of the savings and loan officers
were raised.  The presences of so many adults in these homes "may
trigger feelings of inferiority in young white boys.  The result may
be dangerously low self-esteem, which leads them, when they grow up,
to gamble with depositor's money in a desperate--albeit
ineffective--attempt to feel better about themselves," says
Dr. Kighsquair.

The vast majority of white males do not yield to the temptation to
drive a savings and loan into bankruptcy, the research team cautions.
 "It would be inappropriate to construe this study in a manner that
fuels prejudices against anyone, but when there is such a clear
cultural pattern among one ethnic group, it warrants investigation,"
says Kighsquair.

"There is an unfortunate streak of this kind of behavior in white
males in the past," he says.  "In the nineteenth century you had the
robber barons.  Carnegie, Rockefeller--they were all white males."

The study also indicated that the officers of failed savings and loans
were people who had homes (99.3%), at least at the time they were
heading a financial institution, and that they possessed three or more
credit cards (92%).

"With numbers so overwhelming, we're convinced these may also be
factors in a compulsive tendency to commit large scale fraud," says
Dr. Kighsquair.

The link between possession of credit cards and driving thrift
institutions into the ground is more mysterious, according to the
study.  Repeatedly being allowed to postpone paying for their personal
purchases may affect some cultural groups more strongly than others.
"Unconsciously, some white males may come to believe they will never
have to repay all the money they spend on lavish buildings, luxury
vacations, faulty loans and junk bonds," says the study.

The investigators caution that these findings are preliminary, but
stress that the need for more research is urgent.

"The savings and loan bailout is costing America's taxpayers $600
billion," says Kighsquair.  "Maybe if we can find the pathology in the
white male culture, we can intervene with preventive programs before
the entire federal treasury collapses."

Judy Maclean is a freelance writer and editor in San Francisco.

Editors Note:  When this piece first appeared in the San Francisco
Chronicle in July, Ms. Maclean was contacted by a member of the
Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation in Washington--the
recently created federal agency whose job it is to sell off ailing S&amp;
Ls.  The gentleman was trying to find out how he might contact Dr.
Kighsquair in order to obtain more details of his research.  He said
he had tried to directly contact the National Institute of Research
into Crime Origins, but so far had been unable to locate their phone
number.

Out of the same issue of the Funny Times is a comic by Tom Toles:

Entitled "The Reading of the Will", it is mostly text.  A lawyer is
reading the will to some 'boomers.  Here's what the will says:

Dear kids,
        We, the generation in power since World War II, seem to have
used up pretty much everything ourselves.  We kind of drained all of
the resources out of our manufacturing industries, so there's not much
left there.  The beautiful old buildings that were built to last for
centuries, we tore down and replaced with characterless but inexpensive
structures, and you can have them.  Except everything we built had a
lifespan about the same as ours, so, like the interstate highway
system we built, they're all falling apart now and you'll have to deal
with that.  We used up as much of our natural resources as we could,
without providing for renewable ones, so you're probably only good
until about a week from Thursday.  We did build a generous Social
Security and pension system, but that was just for us.  In fact, the
only really durable thing we built was toxic dumps.  You can have
those.  So think of your inheritance as a challenge.  The challenge of
starting from scratch.  You can begin as soon as--Oh, one last
thing--as soon as you pay off the two trillion dollar debt we left
you.

        Your parents

P.S. We're not dead.  We're enjoying our pensions and Social Security.

The Funny Times also has tons of cartoons, particularly the wonderful
"Bizarro by Piraro" and "Sylvia", but lots of editorial cartoons as
well.  This is a few bucks well spent (and not on a Springmaid sheet, if
anybody remembers that.)

_The Economist_ is a weekly magazine printed in Great Britain which is noted
for giving serious in-depth analysis to weekly new stories, but in which I have
noticed a strong penchant for witty, and often cheeky, comments about news
of the day.  In the 18 August edition, the "Britain This Week" section, we
read:

        "Launching its national @b(breastfeeding) initiative, the
        government announced that 'a multi-disciplinary approach
        which involves professionals, parents, volunteers and their
        supporting structures can best be effective in improving the
        support given to breastfeeding mothers.' Who could ever have
        doubted it."

And, not very much further on...

        "Police were on the lookout for a peeping tom who tried to
        persuade a housewife to strip off by claiming he was measuring
        her for WeightWatchers"

This is not, of course, and advertisement for _The Economist_, although I
think IMNVHAAO that it is the only weekly worth reading, but a notice that
_Time_ and _Newsweek_ are so busy trying to be entertaining that they have
lost the ability to do so.

So, this marks the halfway point in #3038.  I've been bumping into some
limits on what some nodes can handle, and I've been bumping into some
limits on my time, and I had too much good stuff that was getting old to
throw away the last half, so by gum I just cut it in two right here so
if all goes well there should be another chunk of stuff shortly after
this chunk and that will be the end of this edition.
