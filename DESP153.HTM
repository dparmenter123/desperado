Subj:   The Disgrace of G&amp;S.

Well, things have been slow for you, yes?  And so you published the
screed against "Pirates of Penzance" to get a new lively correspondance?
OK, I 'll bite.

G&amp;S is degrading to women, and I will support Cassie adding:

        -"I am the very Model of a modern Major-General" is degrading
to the military, and to my status as a veteran.

        -The Pirate King's song is degrading to business types and my
personal status as a member of the business community.

        -In the original book (but not in the Broadway production) there
is a section that is degrading to those who were buying their way into
the gentry at the time. (The Major-General explains that the people
buried at the hall where he lives are his ancestors, not because they
shared a common lineage, but because he bought the hall and they
belonged to him.)  This is degrading to my status as a Yuppie.

        -They go on to degrade the people at the Royal Astronomical
Society for having something as silly as leap years, which offends my
sensibilities as an engineer.

        I say let's gather at the library and expunge the centuries of
crass humor directed at us all.  "Candide" -- into the flames.  "The
Decameron" -- a disgrace.  "The Collected Collette" goes into the fire
right next to DeMaupassant (or however that foreign-person spelt it.)
Let's stomp out humor, or they'll be lauging at us next!

Subj:   The Pirates of Penzance review by Cassie Phillips

If some of the more obvious venom and pathos were removed from Ms.
Phillips harangue, one could easily could read it as an Anna Russell
style satire.  In fact,  I think perhaps Anna could read it
as is and crack up the joint.

"Pirates of Penzance" focuses on the ethos of the Victorian age and follows it
with a kind of mad logic to its reductio ad absurdum.  It laughs at itself,
and its ageless popularilty demonstrates that people can laugh at themselves.

If we toss out everything that someone, somewhere, sometime
felt was sexist, racist, profane, pornographic, or just generally
disagreeable, we'd be left with a weak subset of the best of the Reader's
Digest and elevator music.

Did Cassie have a point?  Yes indeedy.  G &amp; S 's blatant cruelty to older
women surfaces in several of their operas, in varying degrees:  I used to
think it was funny when Katisha says "It takes a great deal of training
for a man to love *me*" (* Mikado*). And I still get a kick out of the
request from her reluctant suitor:

        Don't you think you are a little young to wed?
        Won't you wait until you're eighty in the shade?
        There's a fascination frantic in a ruin that's romantic--
        Do you think you are sufficiently decayed?

However, carry the underlying attitudes and premises just a shade further,
and you get Ruth in *Pirates* and it's not amusing atall, atall.

Nonetheless, this older woman (me) retorts "Let's not get carried away."
Ruth is pretty unrealistic and you could make a good case that she is
partly asking for the bad treatment she gets (tacky as it is).  In the
second act, when she joins the conspiracy and plays an active role in
deeds of derring-do she is accepted as a complete human being and stops
seeming pathetic and has a pretty good time.  I don't like the prejudice
against older women any more than Cassie does, but it's not the whole
story.

Suggestions:  (1) Over time, the blatantly racist segments of G &amp; S have
been quietly revised.  No longer, in "My Object All Sublime" are heinous
offenders "blacked like a nigger"; they are "blackened with vigor."
Maybe we oughta push to get offensive sexism and ageism similarly
expurgated.

              (2) Consider "Princess Ida."  Partly it's a spoof on
intellectual women, but partly it's not.  It's ahead of its time.  My
personal_name for a while was "Ann of Castle Adamant" (well, it's a
helluvalot more interesting than Green Gables).
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Woof! And here I thought I was just courting favor with Mr. Covert by including
his contribution. (Heh, heh! Just kidding, John! Keep them cards and letters
coming!) I'm as touchy as the next woman, and rarely let a sexist crack go
unpounced on. After all, if we make things sufficiently unpleasant for
people who make such cracks, maybe they'll think before they make another,
and maybe after a few millennia, they'll think about *why* they are being
pounced on. But I also can claim to a certain degree of historical perspec-
tive, and I find it difficult to judge a work of art by the cultural standards
that obtain one hundred years after its creation. On the other hand, I'd
excise "nigger" whenever it comes up, so maybe *my* consciousness needs
raising! Racism bugs me more than sexism? Up against the wall, sister!

Let's drop this and move on -- we're starting to sound like VNS!

Subj:   DoD abandons ADA

(Associated Press, November 15, 1986, Washington)

In a surprise move, the Department of Defense today abandoned its push
toward the ADA programming language standard.  Shell-shocked defense-related
companies are scrambling to respond to this unexpected maneuver.

According to the DoD, ADA was regarded by the White House as beeing ``too
wimpy'' for American computers to use, and so the Department was withdrawing
its support for the language.

Instead, a new computer language (tentatively named ``RAMBO-TRAN'' -
Raw AlgorithMetic Binary Operations TRANsitional Language) will be required for
all future DoD contracts.

RAMBO-TRAN is reportedly a column-dependent, unstructured computer language
which relies heavily on JUMP statements, denial returns, and arithmetic IF's.

All statements must start in column 1, eliminating the possibility of
indenting source code.  Although character strings are supported, they are
limited to a maximum of 4 letter words.

Perhaps the most controversial feature of the new computer language is that
RAMBO-TRAN does not support comments.  (As Casper Ghostberger puts it
``Comments make it easy for the commie spies to steal and decipher our
Software.'')

Asked if the lack of comments wouldn't make software maintenance considerably
more difficult, Ghostberger replied that ``real'' programmers don't like to
comment anyway.  (In a related move, there are apparently efforts being made
on Capitol Hill to link the words 'comment' and 'commie'.)

Unlike most current programming languages which offer extensive error-checking
capabilities, RAMBO-TRAN makes no provision for errors (``Real programmers
don't make errors'' aserts Secretary Ghostberger.)

Instead, the programmer initially targets a ``mission'' for his task; then
if an unexpected error arises, the program begins performing immediate
``GOTO'' operations, all designed to bring the program closer to that
ultimate goal, whatever it may be.

If the program is nevertheless thwarted from performing its mission, it
self-destructs (taking as many other programs with it as possible).

In a related move the Digital Computer Corporation announced that it had
already met 80 percent of the RAMBO-TRAN standards, particularly those
involving self-destruction.  The company is reportedly gearing up for an
expected increase in DoD supported business.

      Attorney Asks To Dismiss Satan From Lawsuit

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - A lawyer has asked that Satan be
dismissed as a defendant in a federal lawsuit here, contending that
the devil doesn't do enough business in Arkansas.
   John Wesley Hall Jr., the devil's advocate, asked U.S. District
Judge George Howard Jr. on Thursday to drop Satan from as a
defendant in a lawsuit filed by Ralph P. Forbes of London, Ark.
   Forbes, an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate, filed the
lawsuit on the day before Halloween, seeking to bar public schools
from observing the rites of Satan on the holiday.
   Forbes filed the lawsuit the day before Halloween on behalf of
himself, Jesus Christ and minor children. The defendants named were
Satan, some units of government, the Russellville School District
and a state education official.
   In seeking the dismissal, Hall contended that there is no proof
that Satan transacted business, owned property or commiteed any
torts in Arkansas.
   He also argued Satan should be dismissed from the suit because
it alleges a controversy between Jesus Christ and Satan which
cannot be litigated in federal court under provisions of the First
Amendment.
   Halloween is not a holiday for Satan, Hall argued, saying the
day was derived from a new year's festival and has become a
traditional event in the United State without ties to religion.
   In Christian theology, Satan is the great enemy of man and good,
usually identified with Lucifer, the leader of the fallen angels.

Subj:   You think *we* have trouble with the Russians?

(This is from "The Economist", 15-Nov-1986, page 33)

"China stops broadcasting backwards to USSR."  That was how the
BBC's monitoring service reported the "reversal" of China's
20-year-old policy on broadcasting to the Soviet Union.  Since October
27th, Peking Radio has been broadcasting its Russian-language
bulletins in the way you might expect:  front-to-back, with the first
syllable spoken being the first one transmitted.  Since 1967 the
Chinese had been broadcasting up to four of their daily bRussian news
bulletins backwards.  Nobody knew why.  Some thought it was originally
just a mistake, and that for fear of losing face the Chinese never
corrected it.  Students of Chinese culture saw it as a subtle insult
to the Russians.

It seems more like that backwards broadcasting was a way round Russian
jamming.  In the mid-1960s China had stepped up its anti-Soviet
broadcasts, but because of Russian jamming the message was not getting
through.  The backwards broadcasts, however, were left unjammed.
Those in the know, such as Russia's professional China-watchers and
Peking's own diplomats n Moscow, could tape-record the reverse
broadcasts and play the tape backwards to hear a comprehensible
version.  The Kremlin apparently did not care about these specialists,
so long as the masses never heard Mao-Zedong-thought.

By the early 1980s, as relations improved, China cut its broadcasting
to Russia by a third and the jamming also declined.  Then on October
12th the Russians ceased their jamming.  Two weeks later the backwards
broadcasts stopped.  China's propaganda now gets through loud and
clear, but wasn't it more fun before?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Pity it's  not the Arabs broadcasting to the Algerian French.
For some reason, I'm convinced that if you broadcast backwards a language
that is read from right to left, it will come through like a normal
language. Which shows just what kind of English-speaking chauvinist I
can be when I try hard enough.

In article &lt;7911@lll-crg.aRpA&gt; figmo@lll-crg.UUCP (Lynn Gold) writes:
&gt;Has anyone out there been to Japan?  If so, have you ever tried fugu
&gt;sashi?  Fugu is the blowfish that is reputed to be a delicacy yet
&gt;poisonous.

There was an entire chapter devoted to a discussion of the Fugu sushi
phenomenon in the book "The Serpent and the Rainbow". The book was primarily
about Voodoo and zombies (clearly Garry Trudeau read this book right before
the Uncle Duke zombie episode). I have no first-hand experience at eating
fugu, but I can tell you what this book says.

Fugu is a species of poisonous puffer fish. Certain parts of its body contain
a powerful neurotoxin. That neurotoxin, in large doses, is used to "zombie"
people in Haiti: it paralyzes the body so completely that the body seems
clinically dead.

Japanese fugu enthusiasts enjoy flirting with death, and they especially
enjoy the LSD-like "high" that comes from eating a sub-lethal amount of the
toxin. Supposedly if you eat a little bit of the toxin, you get a very
enjoyable drug experience. If you eat a bit more, you turn into a zombie. If
you eat more than that, you die. Japanese custom is that when someone appears
to have died from eating fugu (it happens altogether too often), they are not
buried for some long time afterwards, just on the off chance that they are
not actually dead and might in fact recover. Frequently they do: there is a
considerable medical literature in Japan of people who supposedly died from
fugu poisoning, but then suddenly came back to life as the toxin wore off.

There are certain organs that are known to contain high concentrations of the
toxin. I believe that one of them was the liver. Fugu chefs are specially
trained to recognize how close to the poisoned organs they can get away with
cutting, keeping in mind that their customers generally want the largest
sublethal dose possible, in order to maximize the "buzz" that they get from
the fugu.

I do not remember the name of the neurotoxin in question; I don't suppose it
really matters.

Subj:   Be secret and exult...

No, the sixth game was not a dream like last year's season of Dallas or
Dynasty or whatever.  It really happened.

From Peter Gammons, "Living and Dying with the Woe Sox," Sports
Illustrated, Nov. 3, 1986:

    When Boston's second lead had been lost in the eighth inning of
    Game 6, journalist Clark Booth turned to me and said, "Jonathan
    Edwards, Melville, and Ethan Frome are part of us, which is why
    that part of us loves living this ongoing Calvinistic tragedy."

    Mike Barnicle, the Boston Globe columnist, Booth and I were in
    the since-razed Abbey Feare Pub in January of 1976 watching
    a Bruins game.  At the end of the bar, an eldery gentleman
    washed down 25-cent drafts, staring straight ahead for most
    of the game. When the Bruins game ended, he turned in our
    direction. "How the hell could he have taken out Willoughby?"
    he mumbled, then passed out on the bar.

    The last time my brother Ned and I spoke to our father before he
    died in 1981, he said to us, "The Red Sox will win in your
    lifetime."

(Gammons also quotes Mike Torrez: "I'm off the hook. ---- Boston!")

Louis Menand, "Washington Diarist," The New Republic, Nov. 24, 1986:

    Like most overeducated and athletically inept people, I'm a Red
    Sox fan.... My theory [about the loss] is that, seeing clearly for
    the first time in almost 70 years [sic] what int would be like to
    be winners, the Red Sox realized how much finer a thing it is to
    lost.  For there suddenly flashed before their eyes a vision of
    the contemporary culture of winning: they saw that winning would
    mean an interminable orgy of self-congratulation, of high-fiving,
    we're-number-one chanting, Jesus thanking, cereal promoting, and
    video making -- that being winners would mean, in fact, being just
    like the Mets.  It was nearly too late, but they drew back from
    the abyss, and thereby achieved an immortatility untainted by success.

Or as Billy Yeats wrote to his friend:

         Now all the truth is out,
         Be secret and take defeat
         From any brazen throat...
         Bred to a harder thing
         Than Triumph, turn away
         And like a laughing string
         Whereon mad fingers play
         Amid a place of stone,
         Be secret and exult,
         Because of all things known
         That is most difficult.

So, for those who have not heard them:

1.  Q:  What do Michael Jackson and Bill Buckner have in common?
    A:  Each wears a glove on his right hand for no apparent purpose.

2.  Bill Buckner was nearly run over by a bus... But it went through his legs.

3.  Bill Buckner had his right leg amuputated... Next year, he plays shortstop.

CULLED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL FORUM WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE, VOGON NEWS SERVICE:
================================================================================
From: Steve Kovner ............................................ Maynard, MA,

    I guess with an actor for President of the United States, it should
    not be a surprise that current events remind me of old television
    shows.

    We have a Secretary of State who decided not to hear any more about
    the Iran arms deal, acting like his namesake on _Hogan's Heroes_:

        "I hear NOTHING! I see NOTHING!..." (Sgt. Schultz)

    Now, for those of you who have not been degraded by watching this old
    comedy, Hogan's Heroes was about some American POW's in a German POW
    camp who performed many acts of sabotage and espionage while
    prisoners, while the (on the show) dumb Germans saw nothing. In
    particular, Sergeant Schultz would use the above line whenever he saw
    something the prisoners were doing. What a coincidence the Secretary
    of State has the same name.

        We also have seen what happens when one of the Impossible Missions
    Force is caught: the administration says nothing. There was an old spy
    show called _MISSION: Impossible_. It was about some covert agents who
    would perform acts of sabotage and espionage against various targets.
    The leader of the force, Jim Phelps, would receive his instructions
    from a tape recorder hidden somewhere. The instructions would always
    end with the following (slightly changed to implicate the guilty):

        "If you are caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any
    knowledge of your actions. Good luck, Gene Hassenfus. This tape will
    self-destruct in five seconds..."

        (Hmmm. maybe he was listening to the tape just before the plane
    was hit --  :-)

        This message will self-destruct in five seconds...
