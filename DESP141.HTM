I am going to China (People's Republic of) this fall, and I figure
it won't hurt to find out as much as I can about the place before
I go.

My request of the Desperadi is this:  If you've been there, will
you tell me everything about your trip in excruciating detail?  If
can recommend one of the plethora of books about China, will
you do so?  (I'm almost finished with Fox Butterfield's "China:
Alive in the Bitter Sea" and will be in need of another one.)
If you have any friends or contacts in China or Hong Kong who
are any fun, would you be willing to give me their addresses?

Taiwan? And what about Naomi?

                         AN ARMY TRAVELS ON ITS LIVER

                                        Rick Landau
                                        November 1985

        This fall, my wife and my brother and I spent our vacation
        drinking our way through northern California's finest vineyards
        and wineries and restaurants and gutters.  And what do we have
        to show for it?  A cellar full of golden liquids and several
        empty bank accounts.  Oh, yes, and great if spotty memories.
        And probably liver damage.

        You know what it's like to have a buzz on for ten days?  I stop
        drinking the day we fly back East, and I feel terrible the
        whole day, on the plane, at dinner in Boston, all the way home.
        Ms.  Thornton, clever child, samples the airline's hospitality
        to keep her blood alcohol level up in the normal range, so she
        doesn't feel awful until the next day, at home.

        Remember the old vaudeville joke?

        Patient:  (gesticulating) "Doctor, Doctor, it hurts when I do
        this."

        Doctor:  "Don't do that."

        Lesson learned:  the hangover comes when you *stop* drinking.
        Don't stop drinking.

        THE DISCLAIMER

        Now let's get this straight:  this is NOT a learned commentary
        on wine.  This is more in the nature of a travelogue.  It's
        filled with unsupported opinion, raves and raspberries where I
        care to dispense them.  I do not claim to "know a lot about
        wine." I claim only to have opinions when I taste wine.  I
        don't even claim that these opinions are consistent from year
        to year, day to day, or glass to glass.  But at least I write
        them down for the amusement of others.  If you find that some
        of my judgments match your own, then maybe they will be useful
        to you.  If you find that they don't match, well, at least you
        didn't pay much for this book.

        THE PLAN

        We fly to San Francisco and rent a station wagon.  Yes, I
        figure that three people and luggage and a few cases of wine
        might overcrowd the average Avismobile, so for a few bucks we
        get the extra space.  Good thing, as it turns out.  We spend
        time every day trying to make all the crap fit into the station
        wagon.  A mere car would be a disaster with cases of booze
        strapped to the roof.

        Our plan is simple:  if we know the name of a winery and like
        their stuff, check it out; if we don't know the name of a
        winery, check it out.  This eliminates only about ten wineries
        in the state, so we have a lot of work to do.

        The main wine regions in California are in Napa and Sonoma
        counties north of San Francisco, primarily in the Napa Valley,
        which most Americans know through Falconcrest, and the Russian
        River and Sonoma Valleys just to the west of Napa.  We spend
        several days at a delightful inn in St.  Helena in the middle
        of the Napa region, then a few in an inn in Cloverdale in the
        Russian River area, then a few in Sonoma.  We're aiming for a
        thorough sampling rather than a thorough survey.  A real survey
        would require a couple weeks in each region.

        Yes, there are other wine regions in California, but we didn't
        get to those on this trip.  Frankly, I don't care about the
        other regions.  I like the wines from Napa, Philistine that I
        am.

        [There, now the cognoscenti will have stopped reading, so you
        and I can continue.  They would only raise the prices, anyway.]

        Every morning, we try over breakfast to decide on an
        approximate route for the day, then load up the car, the
        cameras, the aspirin, the antacids, and off we go.

        We usually do fairly well with our projected routes.  Of course
        everything takes longer than you expect, so the things planned
        for the end of the day rarely make it on the first try.  If
        they are really important, they get moved to the next day.  If
        not, they get moved to the next trip.  "Save something for next
        time!" is the cry of the overplanned traveler.

        We get lunch at a specialty food store several days, find
        scenic picnic spots up in the hills, and enjoy our quiches,
        cheeses, sausages, chardonnays, and general decadence.

        One of the ways to taste a lot of wines, especially those from
        wineries we can't get to, is to get a basketful of half bottles
        to take out with lunch.  That way we can have several different
        wines with lunch and still be able to drive again before winter
        comes.

        Of course to keep those lunch foods and drinks chilled, we need
        a cheapo Styrofoam cooler and bag of ice in the trunk.  Not
        surprisingly, coolers and ice are easy to come by in a region
        where the local economy depends on alcoholic liquids.  Even if
        we don't want to chill the wines, an insulated cooler keeps the
        sun from baking our cabernet during the heat of the day.

        And of course we have to drink before and during dinner.  One
        of the places we stay has a wine tasting every evening before
        dinner.  Two or three bottles and a selection of breads,
        fruits, and cheeses.  For five people plus the owner.  We try
        to test a bottle every evening before dinner anyway, even if
        there is no organized tasting.

        By plan, it is fall in the valley, harvest time.  The vines are
        heavy with tasty little grapes.  After a few cool evenings
        there are fall colors in the vines, spectacular yellows and
        reds, like midget maples.  I'm told that grapes are quite
        delicious at harvest, though I would never think myself of
        stopping by the road to reach out and taste them.

        Picking and crushing are going on constantly.  The smell of
        fermenting, like rotting fruit, is all over the valley.  After
        a week I learn to hate the smell, but a day after leaving I
        would love to smell it again.  Some of the winery tours are
        more interesting because of the activity.  You get to see--and
        smell--huge vats boiling over with purple foam, for instance.
        Amazing how much gas and heat and general violence little yeast
        things can cause when they are working on ten thousand gallons
        of liquid all at once.

        THE PROTOCOL

        You go to a winery and there is a list of wines to be tasted,
        usually progressing from white to red and from dry to sweet.  A
        few wineries have crackers or bread available to clear your
        palate between wines.  Yes, it really works.  We keep nice,
        dull crackers such as Bremner Wafers or wonderful San Francisco
        region sourdough bread in the car for clearing and for general
        munching.  Sometimes I'm smart enough to put a couple crackers
        in the shirt pocket before going into a tasting room.

        Dave turns out to be a bread fanatic.  Every type of bread
        loaf, brioche, baguette, or roll that we pass for two weeks he
        samples.  Most of them he pays for.  One or more of each finds
        its way into the collection in the back seat.  Some of them are
        wonderful.  Some are very peculiar; I am thinking particularly
        of the fennel pretzel loaf, which sounds less awful than it
        tastes.

        In the tasting room, you get, generally, one glass.  The person
        behind the bar pours you successive tastes of several different
        wines.  A taste is one to two ounces.  Most places you taste
        three or four different wines.  You go to about ten wineries a
        day.  Multiply it out.  Two bottles a day, maybe three.
        Cirrhosis city.

        After the first couple days, I try to cut down by

             1.  limiting myself to a few types of wine, specifically
                 Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Sauvignon Blanc.
                 If there is nothing else to drink, I'll have the
                 Champagne.  I'm easy.  And I can always be talked into
                 an exceptional Merlot or a Johannesburg Riesling.  But
                 wild horses can't drag me to a Zinfandel.

                 Zinfandel is like anti-freeze, only drier.  Ever
                 wonder why they spell Zerex with a Z?  A great
                 zinfandel compares poorly with a mediocre cabernet.
                 White zin compares poorly with Listerine.

                 [Now I've really got rid of the aficionados.  Only an
                 ignorant, crass, asbestos-tongued bungler would admit
                 that he doesn't like zinfandel.  Putrid stuff.
                 Someday someone will get me with a blind tasting, but
                 until then I will exercise my freedom of speech
                 slandering the swill.]

                 By eliminating many of the wines available for
                 tasting, I cut down my consumption noticeably.  Nuke
                 the zinfandels, the white zinfandels, the chenin
                 blancs, the grey rieslings, the red table wines, the
                 white table wines, the chablis, the petit sirahs, all
                 the stuff that I don't especially like.  Concentrate
                 on the things that I do like.  Egocentric, but, hey,
                 it's *my* vacation.

             2.  Stopping after two sips unless I like the wine.  I
                 find that my opinion rarely changes after the first
                 couple sips and sniffs.  If it's ordinary, or worse,
                 don't bother to finish the taste.  Pour the rest of
                 the taste out into the spittoon usually thoughtfully
                 provided.  (Oh, the waste!)

                 If I like the stuff, on the other hand, I don't have
                 the heart to throw it away, so drink it all.  If it's
                 really good, lick out the inside of the glass.

        Having thus minimized my consumption, I then have the wit to
        write down my impressions of the various wines.  Well,
        actually, I write down something about only the ones I might be
        tempted to order again.

        I buy one of the standard Pocket Encyclopedia of California
        Wine books and scribble in the margins alongside the
        descriptions of the wineries.  By the time the trip is over, a
        surprising number of pages are stained with pencil and other
        substances.

        THE IMPRESSION

        My overall impression of the crop of wines being tasted is that
        the whites are good to great, the reds are not so hot.

        Here's some of the subjectivity:  I like light, clear bordeaux
        wines, not the typical three-ton California cabernet.  You
        know, more like St.  Julien or St.  Estephe, rather than St.
        Emilion or Pomerol.  Good thing, too:  they're cheaper.  So I
        think that the 78 California cabs, like Beaulieu, Sterling,
        Rutherford, Phelps, et al., are the best things I've ever
        tasted.  Maybe they won't last forever.  (They sure won't in my
        cellar, because I'll drink them.) Another great vintage is
        bound to come along some year.

        [There, we finally got rid of the last of the wine snobs.
        Liking light, fruity wines that can be drunk young is the last
        sure sign of ignorance beneath contempt.]

        It's really strange.  I have this one friend with whom I
        disagree fairly often on wines.  He swears that the wines he
        prefers are fruity and the wines I prefer taste like kitty
        litter.  And yet I think I prefer wines that taste more like
        fruit than like dirt.  Beats me.

        THE COMMERCIAL PURPOSE

        Back to the mainstream of this evening's symposium, I ought to
        mention that the purpose of a tasting room, as far as the
        winery is concerned, is to sell the product.  They give away
        free samples in the hope that you'll buy the stuff.  They
        particularly hope that you'll buy the stuff there, so they can
        eliminate the profit of the middle man.

        Now, if you come from some other part of the continent, e.g.,
        New Hampshire, which is almost as far away as you can get,
        buying wine to take home with you is problematical.  It is
        heavy, bulky, and fragile.  HOWEVER:

             o   There is wonderful klutz-proof packaging available at
                 most large wine stores in the area.  Big Styrofoam
                 inserts in sturdy cardboard cartons, taped up with
                 indestructible plastic.  The manufacturer's goal is
                 that a six foot drop onto concrete will not spill a
                 drop.  Seems to work, too:  airlines regularly test
                 the cartons this way.  If you are buying a case of
                 wine, most stores will throw in the carton, which
                 otherwise would cost, oh, six bucks.

                 Now personally I would never think of avoiding the
                 liquor taxes of the great state I live in by carrying
                 cases of wine back with me from trips such as this,
                 but I am reliably informed that these cartons actually
                 can survive being checked as baggage on major
                 airlines.

                 You worry about not being allowed to check several of
                 these large boxes in addition to your two suitcases
                 per person?  Again, I would never think of doing this,
                 but I am reliably informed that a ten or twenty dollar
                 bill waved at the curbside check-in often results in
                 unusual arithmetic, such as "One, two, three, four,
                 four, four, four."

Subj:   (from USEnet) -- the robot sentry

   "A much more sinister arrival on the robot scene is named Prowler.
Created by Robot Defense Systems in Colorado, Prowler has been designed
for use as a sentry to guard military installations, warehouses and
other sites where security is important.  When made available in the
near future, this squat, sturdy, mobile device will carry
microcomputers, software and sensors capable of locating intruders.
Chillingly, buyers will be able to arm Prowler with machine guns and
grenade launchers; they'll also be able to program the robot to fire at
will.  The manufacturer claims that interest in Prowler has been high,
both among domestic companies who see it as a comparatively low-cost
replacement for 24-hour human security, and certain foreign countries
where government officials might prefer guards that will never revolt."

Reprinted from the New York Times of 12/27/85:

        Last spring, the Cartier's jewelry store in London
        put on a stiff upper lip and declined to confirm
        that Raisa Gorbacheva, wife of the Soviet leader,
        had visited the store and paid for a pair of ear-
        rings with that ubiquitous symbol of Western life,
        a credit card.

        Now, it seems, confirmation is at hand. Washingtonian
        magazine says in its forthcoming issue that the
        purchase was made with an American Express gold
        card, which is a cut above the one carried by most
        Americans.

        The question was put to Gayla Sangallo, an American
        Express spokesman [sic] in New York: Can it be true
        that the wife of the world's No. 1 Communist has an
        American Express card? "I think she does," she said.
        "But I don't know whether it's green or gold."

of Cheese" after all - "America's Dairyland" has been retained
as the state's license plate slogan.
   Gov. Anthony Earl made that official Monday as he announced a
winning new design for the state's auto tags, saying that nothing
in his three years as governor, including taxes, had provoked such
a public response as the plate debate.
   In deciding to stick with the popular slogan, Earl rejected
scores of substitutes recommended to his office, including "Eat
Cheese or Die" and the poetic "Come and Freeze" entry.
   Most of the proposed slogans were related to agriculture,
including "Cream of the Midwest," "We Butter You Up," "The
Udde Milky Way," and "America's Bratwurst Mecca." A bratwurst
is a type of sausage.
   But any attempt to eliminate "America's Dairyland" probably
would trigger "acriminious debate" in the Legislature, Earl said
in explaining why he preferred retention of the popular slogan.
   The slogan has been on Wisconsin auto license plates since 1964.
Before that, there was no slogan.
   The chance to switch slogans arose when Earl decided weeks ago
that the design of a new license plate to replace the current
black-on-yellow design should be voted on by the public.
   Ballots were published in newspapers around the state, and more
than 100,000 persons sent them in.
   The fifth-place entry proclaimed, "We Like It Here."

Subj:   cheese food and marketeers

In re:  cheese food

        Much to the chagrin of Kraftco Corporation and other makers of
        junk food, the FDA insists that a food item labelled 'cheese'
        be, in fact, cheese.  Kraftco and others make various substances
        out of discarded bits of cheese and various emulsifiers, then
        dye them yellow so that they look like cheese.  The FDA won't
        let it be called 'cheese,' though, unless it is either fresh or
        aged curd with no other special treatment.

        If the substance consists of rinds, trimmings, and other such
        tailings from the cheese manufacture process, melted down, cast
        or extruded into blocks, and pasteurized to kill all the nasty
        things that were growing in it, the FDA allows them to call it
        'pasteurized process cheese.'

        If the substance doesn't consist entirely of cheese, but instead
        is various artificial foodstuffs with some cheese added to give
        it flavor and texture, the FDA allows them to call it 'pasteurized
        process cheese food.'

In re:  marketeers

        I always regarded 'marketeer' as a derivation of 'marketer'
        patterned after 'mouseketeer.'  It is a pejorative term used by
        engineers who are contemptuous of the 'Mickey-Mouse' way that this
        company markets its products.

Back in those dark days of yesteryear, marketeers seemed to do sales support
and field-test support but little that seemed like market research.  That
tradition seems to be changing for the better now, but back in '78, when
I was new to DEC, the image of Annette Funicello in mouse ears seemed more
appropriate than that of John Barrymore with a sword in his hand.

Subj:   New Digital Advertising Slogan

Tom Lehrer would have something to say about the new slogan that the
marketeers have plastered all over Business Week, and this is it:

You say Digital's got it now? Well!

I got it from Agnes,
She got it from Jim,
We all agree it must have been
Louise who gave it to him.

Now she got it from Harry
Who got it from Marie,
And everybody knows that Marie
Got it from me.

Giles got it from Daphne,
She got it from Joan,
Who picked it up in County Cork,
A-kissin' the Blarney Stone.

Pierre gave it to Sheila,
Who must have brought it there.
He got it from Francois and Jacques,
Aha! Lucky Pierre!

Max got it from Edith,
Who gets it every spring.
She got it from her Daddy,
Who just gives her ev'rything.

She then gave it to Daniel,
Whose spaniel has it now.
Our dentist even got it,
And we're still wondering how.

But I got it from Agnes,
Or maybe it was Sue,
Or Millie or Billie or Gillie or Willie,
It doesn't matter who.

It might have been at the pub,
or at the club or in the loo,
And if you will be my friend,
then I might ... Mind you, I said "might" ...
(looks around audience, finally chooses someone, grins,
points to him or her and says:)
Give it to you!

            Last year, my mother got the following heartwarming gift from
        the VISA card folks:

            "As a valued customer, we would like to give you a holiday
            gift.  You may skip this month's payment.  You just don't
            pay it.  Finance charges will continue to accrue, however.
            Best wishes for the holiday season."

As long as you've become the world's repository for this stuff, you might
as well add:
                                Mount Fujiyama

to the list. It's a common phrase that means 'Mount Fuji Mountain'.

Another item is the 'Bleu cheese' dressing available at Tobin's caf in
the mill. But that's something besides a baby puppy, right? It's
definitely a something, though.

Subject: RE: Desperado #1128: Think the dogs will make it?

Unhappily, they (the dogs) didn't make it back from Shackleton's 1914
expedition to cross the Antarctic (had to be shot - no room in the life-
boats). The Arts &amp; Entertainment channel (sort of a junior-varsity PBS
on cable) presented a very engrossing docudrama last night entitled "Ice-
bound in Antarctica: Shackleton." How engrossing? So engrossing that I
watched the whole four hours' worth, and switched to the Orange Bowl only
during commercials (maybe if the score had been closer, I would have left
Sir Ernest trapped in the pack ice in favor of Miami). In any case, it was
quite well done, and even answered my question regarding the medicinal value
of cocaine in treating snowblindness: actually, the cocaine acts to anesthe-
tize the eyeball, so administering the REAL medication won't hurt so much.
And the tobacco fixation was also evident. Sir Ernest almost never appeared
without a cigarette in hand. I wonder if his dependence on the weed was in
any way accountable for his fatal heart attack a few years later? (He was still
a fairly young man.)

Associated Press Fri 03-JAN-1986 11:30                      Space Journalists

   Only 20 Journalists Have Applied for Shuttle Flight

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - With less than two weeks to go before the
deadline, only 20 people have applied to be the first journalist
aboard the space shuttle, officials said.
   More than 2,000 applications are expected by the Jan. 15
deadline, said Eric Johnson, the program director.
   ``We've received about as many as we expected,'' Johnson said.
``We expect most of the applications won't be coming in until the
middle of the month. I know if I were applying I'd take my time
with it.''
   More than 4,000 applications were requested by journalists.
   The selected journalist will be expected to report from space
``on a grass-roots level,'' Gayle Sifford, secretary for the
Journalist-in-Space Project, told the Atlanta Constitution.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration wants the
journalist to report on something ``other than an astronaut saying
`Gee whiz,''' she said. ``They are word people; the astronauts are
more technically oriented.''
   The journalist picked for a fall shuttle flight will be selected
by the Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communications
in Columbia, S.C., in cooperation with NASA and 16 professional
journalism organizations.

GENEVA - Look for heads to roll at Digital Equipment's European headquaters
in Switzerland. The Swiss outpost is full of rumblings about the grumblings
of DEC execs miffed over the extravagant expenses piled up at the company's
recent DECville exhibit held in trendy Cannes on the south coast of France.
The DEC blowout busted the budget, costing the company a cool $2.5 million.
Rumors have it that it may also cost the jobs of those responsible for the
big bash.
