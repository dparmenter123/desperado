        Well, here we go with Plan B.

                                    =*=

        I saw the Red Sox from a Fenway Skybox the other day, and a mighty
        pleasant experience it was.  The very rich are very different from
        you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald observed.  Yes, they have more
        money, as Ernest Hemingway replied.  And they get hassled less and
        get a better view of the ball game and the drinking doesn't stop
        at the bottom of the seventh, I hasten to add.

        There are elevators and escalators up to the Skyboxes, as I
        discovered upon finishing my climb.  There's a line of doors
        looking rather like a certain kind of motel and you enter a room
        that looks that way too, except no beds, at least not in the one
        we went to.  There was a john, a kitchenette/bar, a bunch of
        overstuffed chairs, a dining table, and a glass wall looking out
        on the verdant splendor of Fenway.  Outside the glass wall was a
        bleacherette, three rows of five seats, under a roof.

        Skybox service includes load upon load of food, nothing
        super-fine, but abundant, wholesome and tasty.  They started with
        a bowl of mixed nuts.  Detail:  the bowl was full of pecans,
        almonds, and cashews.  Not a peanut or one of those stale filberts
        or gross Brazils in sight.

        Then came a platter of Fenway Franks; a mini-steam table with
        Italian sausage with onions and peppers, meatballs, and Buffalo
        wings, plus bread and stuff; and a tray of (American) croissants
        with lobster salad, and a luxury gourmet strawberry nestled in the
        curve of the croissant.  Klass-ee!

        A few innings later, a big fat bag of peanuts for each row in the
        bleachers.

        After that, a plate of fresh fruit.

        After that, a plate of humungo brownies and chocolate chip
        cookies.

        After that, an off-brand Dove-style bar.

        Speaking of bars, it was open throughout the evening, and no
        charge.

        You can see the whole field wonderfully well.  One big difference
        was that we could tell the difference between high-hit balls that
        were going to fade and fall and high-hit balls that were outta
        there.  You can't really see that from underneath and I always
        wondered how the radio guys could tell the difference.

        It was Roger Clemens' first game after his lengthy leave of
        absence, and he was tossing tiny little liver pills.  (I had the
        curious experience a few years back of taking some foreigners to
        Fenway and explaining, at the beginning of the game, of Clemens,
        "This guy is the best pitcher in baseball."  Then, in our inning,
        Boggs came up and I said, "This guy is the best hitter in
        baseball."  They looked at me oddly.  "Really, they both are the
        best."  And they were then.)

        There were a bunch of us from work together, muttering, "I've got
        to keep buying those lottery tickets."  The Skybox was owned by
        another company and there were people from that company too,
        including the millionaire president.  He carried 3x5 cards with
        riddles and trivia questions, keeping us proles entertained.

        At the end of the game, after the box owner had gone, we were
        making our own way out when a curious incident occured.  A tall
        pretty, vibrant female guest was standing close to the bar and
        quickly whipped out a plastic bag, dropped in a bottle of gin,
        and then dropped the whole thing into her shoulder bag.  She
        had obviously prepared this in advance.

        Personally, I wouldn't want to see myself as, or be seen as,
        a gin thief.

When I was 11 (a frighteningly long time ago), I had a chance to see one of
Tinguely's sculptures.  My father was a sculpter at the time, so we went to
a lot of museums.  Although this piece wasn't a self destructing device, it
was quite animated.

You could hear it from the next room and upon entering, you ware met with a
very un-museumlike energy.  People were talking, kids were scurryng, beach
balls were everywhere (including the air), and the sculpture/machine was
doing its thing.  "Its thing" was to take beach balls (collected and fed by
museum goers, even those in jackets and ties), process them for a while
with gears, pullies, rollers, pipes, chains, levers, rails, etc., and then
fire them up out of the top in a slightly random direction.  The room was
pleasant happy mayhem.  It was the sort of thing one would expect from Dr.
Seuss if he had gone into sculpting.

We spent nowhere near enough time in the machine's presence; which is probably
part of the reason I remember it so fondly.  I'm glad to see that his work is
still making it into the news.

The latest issue of Consumer Reports had this gem, under the heading:

"Easier Said Than Done"

But the real eye-opener comes from Japanese manufacturer Yamaha. While
perusing the assembly instructions for his new "Electric Grande"
keyboard, a reader found a diagram showing assorted pieces of hardware
and labeled with a single Anglo-Saxon word of instruction. We can't
repeat the instruction in this family magazine, but we believe the
company meant "screw."

A little while back someone in our lab put a section from an
instruction manual for a Japanese electronic organ on the notice
board.

There was one of those exploded diagrams which shows you how to put
the thing together. On part of this there was a screw, two brackets
and a nut with a dotted line between the screw and the nut. To make
sure the instructions where quite clear the Japanese/English translator
had thoughfully added a single assembly instruction next to the dotted
line...."f2k".

Subj:   My career as a mailwatch message writer

        A year or two ago, someone sent you one of my mailwatch messages which
you then distributed, complaining that you were surprised I didn't send it to
you myself. This was the now-infamous alien abduction message that made the
rounds. Well, I thought I'd get a jump on the gun this year. I've taken two
vacations already this summer (more to come if I can get away with it!) and
had mailwatch messages for each which people seemed to have enjoyed (I'm still
working on that future career as a writer for the Weekly World News). Maybe your
readership will also. You may edit out anything which you think might be
sensitive information. However, I let these fly back to anyone!
        From my June '93 vacation:

        Sorry, I cannot respond to your mail at the moment. I am out of the
office until Tuesday, July 6th. In my absence, Richard (STAR::) S2de should
be able to answer questions on Debug Tools or C2L. You could also try Anne
Mc7y (EVMS::R7X), Burns (SKYLAB::) F4r, or Jim (EVMS::) G5d.
        Richard will also be acting moderator of STAR::E4DED-VAX and
STAR::C2L. So send those membership requests/problems his way. Since you're
disappointed with my mailwatch message so far, if you're interested in where I
am THIS time (and don't mind tasteless song lyrics!), read on.....with the
theme from The Beverly Hillbillies running through your mind.....

Let me tell you a little story about a man named Steve
The annual drive to Illinois is his pet peeve.
Champaign, Illinois is the place we gotta be
So he loaded up the van and drove the family...to
Illinois, that is...Land O'Lincoln...no swimmin' pools...

Next thing you know, 'ol Steve's behind the wheel
stoppin' at McDonalds for each and every meal
Corn to the left...Corn to the right
Drivin' cross-country all day and all night
Night, that is...Don't wanna stop...

Three days later Steve arrives in Champaign
No feeling in his legs. In his neck a stabbing pain.
Out from the house comes the cast from Hee-Haw.
Oops...My mistake...It's grandpa and the in-laws.
In-laws, that is, and their dog, Max.

The in-laws say, "This is where you're gonna stay!"
85 degrees at night; 90 by day.
Sweatin' like a pig for more than a week
Gotta wait an hour just to take a leak
No A/C...One bathroom...

After a week that seems like a year
Pedal to the metal, we're gettin' outta here!
Home in New Hampshire is where I'd rather be
Got three bathrooms when I need to pee
Pee, that is, and poop sometimes too...

Then, at last, it's back to work I go
Back to relax, little do they know
But Mother DEC says, "You gotta use vacation time!
Or we'll take it all away...every single dime!"
Dime, that is...Got no money left...

--------------------

And from my July '93 vacation (which I just returned from):

        Nope, I'm not here and won't be back until August 2nd. It's highly
likely that as you're reading this, I will have just emerged from a brisk,
ocean swim, cool droplets of salt water still clinging to my heaving chest. I
firmly stroke my soaked hair back away from my eyes, my rippling biceps pumped
full of blood from the vigorous swim. The salt still stings my eyes as torrents
of water gush through my ears and nostrils, numbing my usually-acute senses.
Slowly, salt water, warmed and stained by its brief voyage through my cranium,
deliberately oozes from each orifice and streams down my neck like rivers of
molten lava, only wetter.
        My hair glistens and sparkles in the intense sunlight, painted pure gold
by the sun god himself. Majestically, my athletic legs carry me to my towel,
which anxiously awaits my embrace on the steaming hot sand. But much
to the towel's surprise, I instead hurl my body upon it, turning to expose my
massive upper torso to the scorching heat, my eyelids pressed tightly together.
There I lay so vulnerable...so innocent...and the towel still rigid with
astonishment.
        My body tingles as the sun bakes every pore, my brain focused on the
smells and muffled sounds of the beach. A radio in the distance is playing
songs I remember from High School, awakening sensations and feelings in that
young, high school athlete. My brain, now mature and sophisticated, quickly
realizes that all future daydreams such as this might possibly take place from
a prison cell...and immediately switches to thoughts of the Red Sox. I drift
off into a hypnotic state, paralyzed like a victim of an alien abduction, and,
coincidentally, resembling a Red Sox batter with an 0-2 count, looking at a
fast ball right down the middle of the plate.
        Children are laughing and playing. They must not be MY children. And
no wonder. They are cooking food on my grotesquely overdeveloped shoulders
which, now hideously sunburned, are radiating sufficient heat to melt the
polar ice caps. I'm intrigued and impressed by the childrens' ingenuity, who
are using the gargantuan sun blisters to hold the food in place.
        The waves are crashing nearby, blending into the numerous conversations
which I can hear ever so clearly. Someone is weighing the pros and cons of a
sex-change operation. Another is describing details of recent hemorrhoid
surgery.
        Suddenly, I'm distracted by a pregnant woman in a thong bathing suit.
A voracious horsefly seizes the opportunity to make its assault, tearing a huge
chunk of flesh from my tender inner thigh. My hand springs like a cobra,
clutching the gorged fly and squeezing the very life from its puny body as I
laugh maniacally with satisfaction. Wary glances from strangers seem to be
questioning my sanity. How dare they? Bwah ha ha ha!!!
        Several distinct odors waft across my flared nostrils in the sea breeze,
blended with the disarray of the gene pool in West Virginia. As with the
analysis of a fine wine, my brain works to decipher each component of the
aroma. Cigarette smoke mingles with suntan lotion and the mellow, smoky, and
yet somewhat fruity stench of decomposing seaweed, shellfish, and crustaceans.
        I reach into the cooler for an ice cold beer. The bottle sweats
profusely in the noonday sun, much like the scene at a Miami Weight Watchers
meeting in July. Sand sticks to the neck and mouth of the bottle as it
approaches my lips and then crunches noticeably between my teeth. I swallow
huge gulps of the icy cold liquid which travels instantly to my lower
intestine, rumbling violently like a thunderstorm in the Texas Panhandle. I
suddenly realize my horrible oversight, not taking care of nature's business
before leaving for the beach, a mistake now haunting me in the noonday sun.
        As cramps stab and slash at my insides like Jason from Friday the 13th,
inconspicuously, and with the deftness of a KGB agent, I measure wind speed
and direction. A small group of elderly foreigners are sitting downwind
as I hatch my evil plot. With the precision of an F16 fighter pilot, I unleash
my weapons of mass destruction. The mother of all gas clouds drifts like a
laser-guided missile towards its unsuspecting prey. As the first victims begin
reeling with terror, my face displays an expression of utmost innocence, like
that of a newborn child. No one suspects. One by one, the elderly victims fall
helplessly like Digital stock, deprived of their life-sustaining oxygen.
        Sorry about that. A postal worker with a gun to my head made me type
all that in! In my absence, Richard (STAR::) Sayde should be able to answer
questions on Debug Tools or CSPL. Unfortunately, he'll be on vacation for part
of the time too. You could also try Anne Mc7y (EVMS::R7X), Burns
(SKYLAB::) F4r, or Jim (EVMS::) G5d.
        Richard will also be acting moderator of STAR::E4DED-VAX and
STAR::CSPL. So send those membership requests/problems his way or try the
others mentioned above if Richard's not available.
        Keep the company afloat until I return from vacation.

There were in this country two very large monopolies.  The larger of
the two had the following record: the Vietnam War, Watergate, double-
digit inflation, fuel and energy shortages, bankrupt airlines, and the
8-cent postcard.  The second was responsible for such things as the
transistor, the solar cell, lasers, synthetic crystals, high fidelity
stereo recording, sound motion pictures, radio astronomy, negative
feedback, magnetic tape, magnetic "bubbles", electronic switching
systems, microwave radio and TV relay systems, information theory, the
first electrical digital computer, and the first communications
satellite.  Guess which one got to tell the other how to run the
telephone business?

This whole thing turned my stomach too, but I haven't done much about
it to be honest... I mean what am I going to do, write a letter to my
congressman complaining about the way the FBI is keeping the peace?

I would guess that the main culprit is the way this story was treated as
national news though.  Until folks get back to getting their news from
some other source than commercial networks whose main purpose is to get
you to watch advertisements for Burger King, Chevy, and Rebok, this is the
kind of reaction we'll have for news which is entertainment.

Most of us (myself included) don't really watch this story for its news value,
this is more like a Western, except we know for sure that it will not have
some sort of sell-out Hollywood ending.  Since most folks don't know
anyone involved who they can identify with, its even better.  It doesn't
matter if the 'good' guys or the 'bad' guys get killed!

Some small tidbits that indicate things may be better than they look.
Apparently a DA local to the Idaho standoff is considering
murder charges against the US marshalls involved.  It seems that they shot
one of the boys in the back, and killed the wife of one of the extremists
while she was standing in a doorway holding a baby.

And did you read recently about the wannabe-BATF cops who arrested an
a capella singing group who were practicing in a handball court (they like the
echoes), "because we thought they were conducting a religious ritual."

They didn't kill them, though; just arrested them.  I guess these cops don't
have what it takes to make it in the federal police forces.

Actually to give them some credit I think the building was closed because it
was late at night.  But that wasn't the arrest reason quoted in the paper.

  ...20 year sentences for possession of marijuana, and 5 year sentences

Oh, probably because these are all done for Our Own Good and Safety.

           in Desperado 3078.

           waiting period for purchasing firearms -- I assume you're
           against it, but this one doesn't work *me* up much.  There's one
           gun control measure I do support strongly and that's making it
           hard to get a federal firearms license.

           RICO -- stinks in every way.  Devised to be used against
           gangsters, it has now replaced conventional conspiracy
           prosecutions.  Anyone who acts in concert with anyone else is
           charged with being part of a racketeer-influenced corrupt
           organization, or whatever the acronym expands to.  The most
           egregious instance I am aware of was the attempt to RICO a
           group of anti-abortion protesters in Brookline, Mass.

           double jeopardy of King trial cops -- well, it's not double
           jeopardy because they weren't tried twice for the same crime,
           but this continual resorting to the federal civil rights laws
           after state courts fail to convict ought to make everyone
           uneasy.  They start by stealing the rights of scumbags like
           those cops, but it's really your rights they're after.

           juror -- don't know the case, but a smart juror is anathema to
           most trial lawyers.  (Lots of my friends have served on juries
           and without exception they say they'd want a jury if they were
           tried.)

           drug sentences versus violence sentences -- Again, they're
           looking for the edge so they can smash our rights.  More than
           half of all drug arrests are for possession, nothing more.

           bans on certain guns because of their appearance -- Most folks
           won't even know what you're talking about here, but, folks, all
           these "assault rifles" and "AK47s" that everyone is so shocked
           about are nothing of the kind.  Would you be in favor of a law
           that banned the sale of deer rifles?  That's all they are.
           They are semi-automatic weapons, nothing more.  The "semi" part
           means you have to pull the trigger once for each bullet; the
           "automatic" means you don't have to cock it for each bullet.
           However, these "assault weapons" have been tarted up with all
           kinds of fins and funky looking holes and black matte finish so
           they look cool.  The next time NPR mentions AK47s, just say to
           yourself "deer rifle painted and trimmed to look like a real
           AK47".  Yes, you say, but they can easily be converted to
           automatic operation.  I hate to tell you this but barefoot men
           who live in tents working with charcoal fires and hand tools
           on either side of the Khyber Pass can make you any weapon you
           desire, at way under list price.  With nothing but a hacksaw I
           can easily convert a shotgun into an illegal sawed-off shotgun.
           With a tin can full of steel wool I can easily convert a legal
           weapon into an illegally silenced weapon.  If you take every
           gun in America away and melt it, I can deliver you a barely
           reliable zip gun tomorrow morning.  If you give me a couple of
           days I can even make sure it won't blow up in your hands.  The
           NRA with its wacky ways is doing more to bring about gun control
           than the the entire Brady Bunch.  Gun nuts (I use the term
           affectionately, but I am not one), if you feel that all of these
           laws are empty gestures, I can see why, but I don't understand
           why you aren't willing to make the empty gesture yourselves.
           Really, propagandizing for teflon-coated dum-dum bullets is just
           not a winning strategy.

Subj:   Re: Waco

There was also a spirited discussion of the events in the Christians
notes file.  The general consensus was 'keep the govt out of church
affairs -- if they're kooks, God will know.'

Without the 2nd Amendment, none of the others will be worth squat.  That's
what makes me so uneasy when I see the press and TV jump on the 'ban
handguns' bandwagon.  It's been proven many times over that the tighter
the restrictions on honest private citizens, the higher the crime rate.
Look at D.C., a 200% rise in crime since the ban in 87.  Capital Hill
has it's own armed security force, so the politicritters aren't worried.

Did you notice with Waco that after the siege had started, all the
reports came out about child abuse, etc.  Yet social workers visited
the compound at least quarterly; they never reported any abuse or
neglect.  Even if it were true, child abuse is not a federal offense.
Notice that the original sealed warrant has never been released.  I
think if the TV coverage had looked at it differently, the rest of
the country would have, too.  One person here at work used the Jones-
town as an example of what could have happened, but never seemed to
see that what really happened was much worse.  Oh, well.

I really look forward to your issues.  Thanks.

        Actually, the First Amendment is the one that keeps the whole show
        together. The 2d Amendment is kinda symbolic, because, heck,
        they've definitely got more and better arms than we have,
        particularly me.  The sum total of my armament is a Sears BB gun, a
        Big Bang Carbide Cannon (Motto: "Real Noise for Boys"), and a bunch
        of fireworks.

Sir,

Yr obedient Boswell  laments the suspension of the latest
numbers of your Desperado.

The following paragraph from yr well-known Rambler
(#4 Sat, Mar 31 1750)  sums up some of the pleasure that
Desperado has provided to many readers besides himself:

   And join both pofit and delight in one -- Horace (tr. Creech)

    The works of fiction, with which the present
    generation more particularly delighted, are such as
    exhibit life in its true state, diversified only by
    the accidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by
    those passions and qualities which are really to be found in
    conversing with mankind.

May the new format begin soon, and in the mean time, I hope
your work on the Dictionary progresses apace.

In anticipation of yr new Ramblings

                    Yr obednt servant,

                    Mark

From Musician, Dec. 1992,  by J. D. Considine.
As reprinted in The Utne Reader, March/April, 1993.

Remember the scene in Wayne's World, where Wayne, about to buy
the guitar of his dreams, begins to pick Jimmy Page's most famous
arpeggio and is interrupted in mid-strum by the salesclerk, who points
to a sign on the wall reading "No Stairway to Heaven"?
Pure fantasy, right?

Wrong.  Though there may not be a sign on the wall, there is a
"No Stairway" policy at the Sam Ash store in White Plains, New York.
"There's no 'Stairway to Heaven,' no Poison songs, no 'Smoke on the
Water,'" explains guitar salesman Rob Knippel.  "The keyboard players
can't play 'Jump.'   No keyboardist who plays a Van Halen tune is
allowed in the store."

Seem a little touchy, do they?  Well, you would be, too, if you had to hear
the same half-dozen songs butchered over and over, day in and day out.
"It's not that you get sick of it," avers Knippel, sounding, frankly, sick
of it.  "It's hard to say.  We know a lot of these kids, and we'll rap with
them or whatever.  The first time they'll play this song, it'll be like,
'Can't play that song.'  'Why not?'  'You can't.'  'Why not?'
'Because we don't like that song.'"

Part of the problem, argues Ralph Perucci, a former Sam Ash salesman
who now reps for Paul Reed Smith guitars, is that none of these kids
knows an entire song.  Instead, what they'd wank away on would be a
jumble of bits, what PRS general manager Mike Dealy describes as
"House of the Rising Smoke on the Stairway to Freebird."

"They'd practice all week to come to the music store and try to impress
someone," Perucci says.  "They'd play their fastest lick over and over
again.  I'd go over and put a dollar on the counter and say, 'If you can
play a song from start to finish, you can walk out with this dollar.' And
they'd look at me like I was from Mars, but no one would be able to do it."

This seems to be mostly a guitar player's disease, by the way.  "With
keyboard players, most of them are classically trained to an extent; they
can play," says Dave Belzer, a salesman at the Guitar Center in Hollywood.
"Drummers, you'd be surprised.  A lot of good drummers come through."

"Guitarists are a different breed.  A lot of them can't play the songs
correctly, or with rhythm.  Rhythm is definitely lacking.  And it seems the
worse they play, the louder the play.  The ones who can play, they don't
get excessive with the volume. The ones who can't, they'll turn it up as
loud as can be."

But if you want to know what really scares music store employees, it isn't
the kids who can't play -- it's the kids who can.  "It's amazing how good
some of them are," says Knippel.  "It's a far cry from when I started.
These kids come in at 16 or 17, and they're showing me stuff.  'How long
you playing, kid?'  'Oh, three or four years,' and the guy's completely
burning.

"Back in the old days, when they used to play the songs, they used to play
them bad," he adds, wistfully.  "Now they play the songs, and they play
them good.  Those are the ones we hunt down and kill."

                                SO, THIS IS SHORT?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        I assure you, there is something different about doing it this way.
