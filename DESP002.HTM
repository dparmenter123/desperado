As could be expected, DEC stock has not fared well.  It appears to have lost
12 points in less than 2 weeks.  Today it was the 10th most active stock on
the NYSE (losing of course).  It could be worse...

Prime and Wang BOTH lost BIG (more than DEC) and their stock was only hanging
in the 20's and 30's.

The more I look at it, the more frightening it gets.  The stock option was
supposed to MAKE money!

A friend of mine spent some time in Aspen and came away referring to
the inhabitants as "powderheads", on the theory that the only thing
that interested them was white powder, indoors or out.  On the other
hand, the following submission (probably copyright by someone) shows
that not everyone in Colorado is in a whiteout.

Subj:   The Real Rules

                The unwritten laws on how life is lived

                        By Steven B. Van Auken

        There may still be some people who believe that they ought to be
free.  Not just free to vote as they choose, or live where they wish; but
free to do anything, and still be accepted by the rst of us.  This ideal
was common not too long ago. But society has changed, our expectations of
ourselves and others have changed.  Since the disappearance of the last
known hippie in l979 (Jason Feinmeister, known as Moonstone, was last seen
cadging spare change outside a "Dare to be Great" business motivation rally
in San Francisco), most of us have accepted the idea that society imposes
certain rules or conventions that must guide our behavior, if we hope to get
what we want.

        These rules are not the kind that are written into law.  They are too
important for that.  They are based simply on our assumptions of how life works
from day to day.  Most of us understand them intuitively, and would no more
think of violating them than we would expect our banker to have our best
financial interests at heart.  Still, there may be those who may have missed
absorbing one or more.  To reduce the discomfort of these individuals, some
of the more obvious rules of effective functioning are offered here.  To
avoid the consequences of socially naive behavior, then, it is important to
understand that:

        You should never speak or look at a stranger in an elevator.  Only
clearly deranged persons have the right to violate this rule in any fashion.
During a recent power outage in New York City, 15 persons were trapped in an
elevator for six hours.  After the fourth, one of the riders "broke" and
remarked it certainly was hot.  Four Passengers were killed while attempting
to climb the elevator cables in a frenzied effort to get away from this man.

        It is foolish to stand in a bank line behind anyone who does not look
fretful and impatient.  Calm, serene people in bank lines have nothing in
particular to do, so they have come in to cash their coin collection,
open a Christmas Club account, solicit contributions to a Little League team,
and ask the teller to accompany them to the parking lot to help unlock their
keys from inside the car.

        There are certain phrases that one may not use in discussing one's
finances with representatives of the I.R.S. Among these are:

        "Hey, what's a few bucks more or less,"

        "I figured, what the hell, deduct it and see what happens,"

        "Have you ever tried to get work in the real business world?"

        "It didn't seem like a big deal,"

and

        "We both know that everybody does that."

        Anyone who gives you directions in which you are required to count
traffic lights--such as, "Go right up here, past where the old Miller place
used to be, and turn left at the third light"--should be considered completely
unreliable.

        It is asking for trouble to talk to a 16-year-old gas station
attendant about anything farther inside your car than the gas cap.  Inside
the station, or home for lunch, is a 50-year-old man with a blue shirt
that says "Jim." His name is Fred, and he knows everything about cars.
The boy was recently assigned to the station by his vocational counselor
at the high school, and he won't be there much longer anyway, because he
is stealing tires.

        You should never smile at a man on a bus who is talking to himself.
He will want to tell you how the CIA and his social worker are trying to
steal his millions, and they you look just like the guy who seduced his wife
15 years ago.

        Everyone carries about him his own personal space.  In the United
States, this space extends about eight inches on all sides of a person.
People do not like to have this space violated by anyone for any reason.
They will resent you attempts to get to close.  The only exception to this
is sexual intercourse, and even then many people prefer that the basic
boundaries be re-established as soon as is practical.  This is particularly
common among couples who have not been formally introduced.

        Favors are sometimes done in what seems an off-hand manner, but this
is deceiving.  Actually, every person maintains complex internal "ledgers"
that document past favors given and received.  When a friend or acquaintance
asks us to "do a small favor," we immediately come on our guard, and
consult the balance sheet to determine whether this person has earned the
right to a favor.  When the ledgers get out of balance, there will be
trouble in the relationship.  The hard feelings may come as a surprise to
the person who has collected more favors than he has delivered, if he is
insensitive to the rules.  Still, the meaning of the dispute is clear once all
the facts are known.  For example, it is now well known that Mamie
Eisenhower made all the major foreign policy decisions during both of her
husband's presidential terms.  She never asked for anything in return until
one evening after dinner she asked that the Seal of the United States be
redesigned to include a salad fork in the talon of the eagle, along with the
chaff of wheat.  When her husband refused, Mrs. Eisenhower went to bed
early and did not speak to the President for the remainder of his
administration.

        With a few moments' reflection, anyone can add other real social
rules to this list.  The effort is worthwhile, because in today's
competitive social climate, the consequences of indiscretions are more
severe than ever.  But while improving you own social acceptability,
always bear in mind the most important rule of all.  It is the one to
observe closely when, for example, inappropriately addressed by the leader
of a group of Hell's Angels with whom you find yourself sharing an
elevator.  This is the rule that advises,

                Never follow the right rule at the wrong time.

Subject: Don't Panic!

Grab your towels, more action is on the way! The following is taken
verbatim from the Channel 11 (NH PBS) program guide.

        "An hilarious new seven-part series, THE HITCHHIKER'S
        GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, starts Saturday, Oct. 23 at 9pm.
        Produced by the BBC, the series features some of the
        most advanced technology in the field of television
        with spectacular special visual effects. Simon Jones plays
        Arthur Dent, the earthling rescued from Earth a few
        seconds before its destruction to make way for a
        hyperspace by-pass; Mark Wing-Davey is the two-headed,
        triple-armed Zaphod Beeblebrox and Stephen Moore is the
        voice of Marvin the paranoid android.

        The series promises to be a favorite among DR. WHO fans,
        computer afficianados...anyone with a sense of humor."

The schedule is:

        Saturdays at 9pm, repeating Sundays at 11:30am, starting Oct. 23.

For those planning to get the series from Channel 2, be aware that Channel
2 is more likely to break up the show for 'commercials', although I'm not
sure if they actually cut footage or not. Channel 11 does neither.
