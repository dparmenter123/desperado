Subj:   Chili recipes from Desperado

I've developed my advanced packrat characteristic beyond belief.  I can't
believe that anyone who would keep letters in a file cabinet wouldn't
keep old mail from 1970's (my archive goes back to 1979).   Anyway, a MAIL
SEARCH for CHILI found Desperado issue #1099.   #1099 happens to be the first
Desperado in my "new" filing scheme, and the previous issues aren't handy.  I
believe there was some chili discussion in the previous issues.

The relevant chili topics from #1099 are attached, along with my personal
recipe, suitable for inclusion in the next Desperado.

Happy gastroenteritis.

Ingredients/instructions

Brown the following:

1 to 1 &amp; 1/2 lbs ground round w/
 chili powder - a couple of table spoons
 onions - 1 or two medium, cut in 8ths

Add:

v8 - 16 oz
refried beans - 16 oz can
whole tomatos - 28 oz can
tomato paste - 6(?) oz can
 You may want to add the refried beans after the v8, as its easiest to
 stir into the mess before adding other things.

Add peppers according to taste in chili - beware, my ratings may be a
tad conservative - I like the stuff hot.  I usually don't cut the
peppers into too small of pieces - leave big chunks, gives the stuff
more substance when done.  Smaller pieces tend to cook away to
nothing.

 red bell               1       1       1       1
 banana                 3       6       3       3
 jalopena                                       3
 red/green chyann                       3       3

Add:

garlic - two cloves - chopped.

Then:

beans (from dried pintos - NOT KIDNEY beans)
 I recommend dried pinto beans that have been soaked in water over
 night.  Use two cups of beans (before soaking).  If you use the
 canned variety, do not add the beans untill about two hours before
 this is done, as cooking the canned variety for 8 hours + will cause
 them to fall apart.

 For really abusive sorts, take a couple of Jalopenas and chop them up
 - boil in the water you intend to soak the beans in for a spell, then
 soak the beans as usual.  Watch out though, this will hot up the
 beans real well.

pickle relish - 1/4 cup, trust me.

Cook this whole mess for about 8 hours.  Enjoy!

Be carefull to simmer this on a real low setting - a large crok pot
works very well, but this barely fits in the larges of pots.  The
refried beans which are there to thicken up this stuff tend to burn on
the bottom if you're not carefull.   If you can't keep it from boiling
harder than just the minumim, stir it up every hour or so.

Subject: The REAL way to make chile

Sir,

What you have done to slander and demean the noble chile plant in your last
DESPERADO cannot pass unnoticed! I shall attempt to re-educate you on your
misplaced ideas on what constitutes good chile. I will also go farther:
I will challenge anyone who reads this to a chile cook-off, my time-tested
and wholly traditional NEW MEXICAN chile (we spell it with an "e" in these
parts, partner) versus your unspeakable and most foul abomination of a recipe
which obviously has its roots in the TEXAN "chili" which is uneatable.

        How, you may ask, can I say these strong words so very soon after the
publication of the recipe for this gross STUFF which has been so callously
named "chili"? (at least you got the spelling right.) The answer is too
simple. I looked at the list of ingredients and saw the word "BEANS" (Kidney,
at that!) right there in the recipe. Why, even the Texans who throw organized
"chili cookoffs" -- those folks without whom Terlingua would be known only to
a few drug-crazed peyote-seekers and river rafters -- specifically state in
the rules for their dishes, NO BEANS! No spaghetti, no pasta, no thickeners...
but especially NO BEANS! Not a single Pinto. Nary a Navy. Less Limas.

        Now, do not get me wrong... I, as a native New Mexican, have downed
far more than my share of the "musical fruit". It is impossible not to enjoy
the faintly nut-like flavor of a good Pinto bean, gently simmered until the
skin barely pops, then mashed and fried in a skillet to produce the brown
mass known as "frijoles refritos". And I confess to downing these little gems
swimming around in the juices left on the plate from a hearty dollop of chilE
(either red or green). BUT... I, like everyone from New Mexico, simply will
not cook these beans in chile. The title of your chilI explains so fragrantly
why.

        One more point to remember, chile is a vegetable, not a spice. It has
more vitamin C than an equal weight of citrus fruit, and more vitamin A than
an an equal weight of carrots. This is green chile, which is enjoyed in New
Mexico at every opportunity rather than its dried brother, red chile.
Unfortunately, green chile is unknown elsewhere.

        Now, to the recipe. This is the way New Mexicans make red chile.
It is really simple. Chile and meat are just about the only ingredients.
Take some meat.  Mixture of beef and pork is best, although either (as well
as venison, caribou, antelope, squirrel, or even chicken) works quite well.
Cut the meat into 1/2-inch cubes. Chopped or ground meat will disintegrate
into the broth, which is what you do not want. About three pounds of meat
will do, after trimming.

        Brown these cubes of meat in a skillet. During the browning, after
there is a little grease in the pan, add one onion, some garlic, and one
pound -- repeat, one POUND -- of red chile powder. Avoid things like "Carroll
Shelby's Chili Powder" or "Two-alarm chili mix" like the plague (which we in
New Mexico can also provide). Crush a teaspoon of cumin seed, and a teaspoon
of coriander, and add about one oz. of sage.

Add water. Let simmer for about two hours. The red chile will cook down, and
you do not need to add tomatos for color. If you like stewed tomatoes, do so
in another pot and eat separately.

        Serve with cheese (you got that part right), FRESH tomato chunks, and
crackers. You'll instantly regret it -- "good chile burns twice!" but will
never never go back to that insipid TexMex STUFF with beans.

                               CHILI ARGUMENT

              Wish I had time for just one more bowl of chili.

                                   - alleged dying words of Kit Carson

 Maybe the second quickest way to start an argument in Texas is to propose a
 recipe  for chili.  And not just Texas.  Steadfast Love and I have for some
 years disputed about the ontological relationship of beans to  chili.   (We
 are  both  pro-tomotato-ists.)  Steadfast thinks the beans go in the chili,
 and I hold the correct view.

 There are other controversies (see Bibliography below), such as whether  or
 when  to  skim  the grease.  Jane Butel, in Chili Madness, says "To skim is
 folly," asserting that the fat is an important catalyst in flavor.  The fat
 should  be  skimmed  only  after the chili is cooked.  Wick Fowler -- whose
 chili mix I use and recommend -- advocates  skimming.   He  also  advocates
 covering the chili during simmering.  Butel opposes covering on the grounds
 that "it inhibits flavor and texture development." I dunno bout thet  thar,
 but  I  don't  cover mah chili on account I like to fill the house with the
 fumes.  When the paint starts to peelin' off the walls, I know it's done.

 Anyway, this  isn't  really  a  recipe  but  an  endorsement  (unsolicited,
 unremunerated)  for Wick Fowler's "Two Alarm Chili Mix," which is generally
 available in supermarkets.  (I append, however, Fowler's original  recipe.)
 The  packaged  mix  contains  a few small, celophane packets of seasonings,
 dried onion, and masa harina (fine corn meal for thickening).  Some friends
 of  mine,  neither  of  whom are cooks, discovered the stuff when they were
 living in Texas and told me about it.  I've  tried  mixes  by  Pecos  River
 Spice  Company,  Carroll  Shelby  (same dude who did the Mustang 350 GT and
 other monster cars), and some others, but  Fowler's  is  the  best.   Costs
 about a buck and a half per package.

 According to Fowler himself, if you add only half the red pepper, it's  One
 Alarm;  all  of it, Two Alarm; all and then some of your'n, Three Alarm.  I
 usally make Two Alarm and Half a Scream.  Fowler says that Four  Alarm  can
 open sinus cavities unknown to medical science.

 Oh yes, the alarm scale has some scientific basis --  and  a  medical  use.
 About three years ago, a friend of mine was pregnant and overdue.  I made a
 batch of three alarm chili for her and  later  that  night  she  went  into
 labor, briefly, and gave birth to a bouncing, burping boy.  Last year, same
 thing.  But I made the chili a little milder, and she had a  longer  labor.

                         1. WICK FOWLER'S CHILI MIX

 INGREDIENTS

      2 LB Meat [see Notes &amp; Variations]
      8 OZ (can) Tomato sauce
      2 CUP Water
      1 Pkg. Wick Fowler's Two Alarm Chili Mix
      Salt to taste
      Cayenne pepper to dare

 DIRECTIONS

 1.  In a cast iron skillet pot (Dutch oven), sear the meat until  it  turns
     that grayish, half-cooked color.

 2.  Add the tomato sauce and the water.

     You can use just about any tomato-based product  --  even  ketchup.   I
     prefer a mixture of crushed or whole tomatoes and some tomato puree.  I
     don't like tomato paste for anything except axles.

 3.  Add all the other ingredients except for the masa harina.

     The other ingredients (from  the  package)  are  chili  powder,  cumin,
     cayenne,  dried onion, and so on.  Generally I add some more onion, cut
     into small pieces.

 4.  Stir occasionally.  Cover (per Fowler; leave uncovered per  Butel)  and
     simmer  for  an hour or more.  Skim the grease (per Fowler; not yet per
     Butel).

 5.  Mix the masa harina with water to  form  the  ideal  thick-but-flowable
     mixture.  Stir this into the chili to -- as Fowler says -- tighten it.

 6.  Simmer about another 15 or 20 minutes so that the masa cooks in.

 7.  Add salt to taste.

 SERVING

 Okay, beans.  Fine.  Just keep 'em on the side.  Beans do NOT belong in the
 chili -- with chili, yes; in chili, no.

 Accompany with a salad -- couple kinds of lettuce, some radishes, a  sliced
 avocado.   Also,  some  grated cheese, like a Monterey Jack or a very sharp
 Cheddar (such as Black Diamond).  Rat cheese is okay.  And maybe  some  raw
 onion for those with stable relationships.

 Beer, of course.

 Oh, yeah, there are probably some  psychobabbling  Californians  who  drink
 Ridge zinfandel with chili, but these people are not to be relied on.  They
 chat about their Cartier watches and the  Lebanese  immigrant  who  repairs
 their  BMW's  and  how many points they got on the last movie they did with
 George and Steve.

 Beer, I say.  You can hunt  around  for  Pearl  or  Lone  Star,  which  are
 somewhat  Coors-ish, from Texas.  Myself, a dark beer:  Prior's Double dark
 used to be a real bargain (and is about the  closest  commercial  brand  to
 Jacob  Wirth's  Special  dark, than which there is none better), but lately
 they put it in fancy-shmancy bottles, reduced to a four-pack, and jacked up
 the  price.   Also  Augsberger  Dark  from  Wisconsin.  San Miguel from the
 Philipines makes a good dark beer, and there are  couple  of  good  Mexican
 dark beers -- Negra Modello, I think one's called.

 NOTES AND VARIATIONS

 Some folks put sour cream on the chili -- it's  not  bad,  really,  but  it
 dilutes  the  effect.  You might keep some handy for non-Kosher guests with
 one-alarm palates.   Fowler  himself  says  that  buttermilk  is  the  best
 quencher (douser?).

 The meat can be all beef or a mixture of beef and pork.   (Also,  I've  had
 chili  made with venison that was excellent -- in fact, it was the best way
 I've ever had venison, which is otherwise a surrogate for Alpo.) You want a
 tough cut -- chuck, not flank steak -- that can stand up to the stewing.  I
 like to combine ground meat and chunks.  I read  somewhere  that  the  meat
 chunks  should  be  about  .45  caliber  (or the size of the tip of a man's
 finger).  If you're going to put any of the left-overs on  hot  dogs,  make
 'em about .38 caliber.

 Sometimes I put sausage in the chili --  hot  Italian  sausage  or  Spanish
 chorizo.   I understand that in Cincinnati, chili is a religon.  It's often
 served over spaghetti or macaroni.  I tried this and liked it --  Steadfast
 didn't, but she was still pissed off about the beans.

                   2. WICK FOWLER'S ORIGINAL RECIPE

 If you have real, fresh or dried chiles,  you  can  try  Fowler's  original
 recipe, as reprinted in The Great American Chili Book by Bill Bridges.

      3 LB Beef
      1 1/2 CUP Tomato sauce
      1 TSP Tabasco
      3 (heaping) TBS Chili powder
      1 TSP Oregano
      1 TSP Cumin
      2 Onions, chopped
      6 cloves Garlic (minimum)
      1 TSP Salt
      1 TSP Cayenne
      1 TBS Paprika
      12 (or more) dried Japones (very hot chiles)
      6--8 Chilipiquins (extremely hot chiles)
      3 TBS Flour (for thickening)

 According to Bridges, Fowler recommends  skimming  before  thickening,  and
 letting  it  sit  in  the pot overnight to be reheated the next day.  Chili
 does age well (even in the freezer!), rather like curry.

 BIBLIOGRAPHY

 The classic work is Frank X.  Tolbert's A Bowl of Red.  Recipes  and  lore.
 Must  reading  for  all capsicumphiles.  Fowler is one of the heroes of the
 book in a showdown with H.  Allen  Smith  that  started  the  annual  chili
 cookoffs.

 Jane Butel, head of the Pecos River Spice  Company,  wrote  Chili  Madness,
 which  lists  some  mail  order sources and gives a number of recipes.  She
 cites Fowler's mix, but  doesn't  give  the  secret  recipe  ---  which  is
 understandable:  Fowler's is her competitor.

 Bill Bridges, The Great American Chili Book is half recipes, half lore.   I
 think  it's  the  best  of the bunch.  It contains an interesting glossary,
 including such items as "WET SHOES," an order of french fries smothered  in
 chili,  as served at Chili West in Oxnard, California (although reported to
 have originated in Atlanta, Georgia).

 Martina and William Neely, The International Chili Society  Official  Chili
 Cookbook  is  a thorough collection of recipes (including H.  Allen Smith's

 Raymond Sokalov, in his Fading Feast has a chapter on chili  that  includes
 good recipes.  By the way, it's a good book on American regional cooking.

                       3. JALAPENO CORNBREAD

 This one is from the Times, I think.  If Steadfast  isn't  too  overwrought
 about  the beans, she makes it to accompany my chili.  She don't know beans
 about chili, but she's got all that weird baking  stuff  down  good.   ("Is
 there  really  a  difference  between baking soda and baking powder?" Sigh:
 "Yes, dear.")

 This stuff is a wee torrid, too, but  if  you  make  your  chili  mild  (to
 accomodate  the  wimps),  you can get your hots by soaking the cornbread in
 the chili.  Or, chop some of the jalapenos and the brave can  add  them  to
 the chili.

 Steadfast, mindful of my past misrecording of her recipes,  enjoins  me  to
 note  that  this  is  "quite  moist,"  but  she  hasn't told me what you're
 supposed to do about  that,  if  anything.   Probably  means  something  to
 bakers.

 INGREDIENTS

      1 CUP Cornmeal
      1/2 CUP Flour
      Salt, to taste
      1/2 TSP Baking soda
      1 CUP Cream-style corn (canned)
      1 TBS Jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (canned is okay)
      1 CUP Cheddar cheese, sharp, grated
      1/2 CUP Oil (corn, peanut, or vegetable)
      2 Eggs, slightly beaten
      1 CUP Buttermilk

 DIRECTIONS

 1.  Preheat the oven to 450 F.

 2.  Sift the cornmeal, flour, salt (if any), and baking soda into a  mixing
     bowl.

 3.  Add the corn, jalapeno, and cheese.  Stir to blend.

 4.  Blend the oil, eggs, and buttermilk.  Add to  the  corn-jalapeno-cheese
     mixture.  Stir to blend.

 5.  Grease (ugh!) an 8" skillet, and pour in the batter.

 6.  Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.

 NOTES AND VARIATIONS

 Any leftovers, if slightly stale, can be crumbled into the chili or used to
 make a very good stuffing for chicken.

 Canned jalapeno (like El Paso brand) is fine for this.  If you do get fresh
 peppers  --  Star  and  Stop  &amp; Shop carry 'em from time to time -- be very
 careful handling them:.  The oil is very caustic.  As you seed and chop the
 peppers,  don't  get  any in your eyes.  Later, wash your cutting board and
 knife well (or the oil will get on whatever you cut up next).  Also,  scrub
 your hands very well.  Once, after cutting up some serranos and jalpenos, I
 thought I had scrubbed all the oil off my hands.   Later,  I  went  to  the
 bathroom  for  other  purposes, and discoverd that there was still some oil
 left...  Uh, it got my attention all  right.   Nowadays,  when  I  have  to
 handle  such stuff, I use a pair of Steadfast's laboratory gloves or I wrap
 my paws in plastic sandwich bags.

        First of all, you don't need the ground beef.  Secondly, you don't
want to use taco sauce; make your own sauce.  Thirdfully, if you soak the

Now, for my own recipe (on three pages) unabashedly adapted from a similar
tasting (but not so nearly entertaining) recipe by Steve Sicola, along with a
few refinements for personal taste.   I've field tested this recipe at several
group gatherings, and am confident that it's ready for general release.

Note that this is a beanless chili.

This is the Green Chili recipe.    This is NOT the traditional east-coast
chili (hamburger and beans) but more like the southwestern chili; in fact, it's
the closest I've ever gotten to the Tee Pee's stuff.  I got the recipe from
Steve Sicola who got it from his mother who got it from someone else who got
it from the mayor of Hermicillo, Mexico.  For a few years, this is what
Sicola, Lary et. al. cooked at the Colorado Springs Chili Cookoff.

This isn't as much a recipe as it is a story of cooking the chili.   Here goes:

The first step is to cut up about 5 pounds of pork into about one-half inch
cubes.  The pork you use is your choice.   My personal choice is pork chops;
but don't get them too lean.  (I've never tried it, but Sicola says a pork
roast will work if you're into wielding a knife for hours; I fear that the
average pork roast would be too lean.)   Also, you *CAN* use beef, but the
result isn't as tasty, is alot greasier (it required continuous siphoning),
and doesn't have the same flavor as the port version.

After the pork is chopped up, heat up about 4T (or more) of oil in a large pot,
and throw the pork into it.   The pork *must* get cooked (well browned) on all
sides.   I find that the easiest way to insure this is to pour off the cooked-
down fat into a bowl and continue cooking the pork chunks until they're
uniformly browned.

When you get a consistent brown color throughout, then put back any
siphoned-off juice and stir in flour (preferrably whole wheat flour)
until no grease remains.

Next, add 2-4 cups of water depending on how much pork is left after cooking.
This is to get the pork off the bottom of the pan and to get a nice gravy
going.   Keep adding water until the mixture is not too thick.  Then add a
one-pound can of tomatos to 5 pounds of pork.  You can chop up the tomatoes,
but I just break them into smaller pieces in the can with a fork or knife.

Then, add 4 cans (4 oz ea) of MILD green chili peppers for 5 pounds of pork.
They can be whole or chopped; if whole, break them into smaller pieces.

This is the decision point:   If you want the chili hotter, add an additional
one to four cans of whole jalapeno peppers (seeds and all).   The last time
I made it, I used two cans.  The next time I'll cut it back to one can.   If
you want  to take the time to cut the seeds out of the pods, you could use more.
N.B.   Handle jalapeno peppers with rubber gloves or make sure you wash your
hands well when your're done, and whatever you do, don't rub your eyes.

[I told you this was a story. Have you ever seen Julia Child measure anything
precisely? I just pour things together until, well, you know, it seems right.
I learned this method of cooking from my mother whose recipe-less spaghetti
sauce is the best in the world.   When you fine tune this recipe, I challenge
you to put it on one of those little 3½ x 5 cards.]

Now the rest of the seasoning:

Add as much garlic as you can stand.   About 10 cloves for 5 pounds of pork.
(It sounds like alot, but garlic makes you live a long time.)

Add salt to taste.   I use the Julia Child method of salting, so I really
don't know how much I put in.

Now just let the chili simmer for about two to three hours.  The final
consistency should not be too thick, but it shouldn't be too runny either.
I like mine the consistency of a sauce for use in or over burritos (medium
thickness).  If you like it from a bowl, you might want it a little runnier.

I have used beer for some of the water - it adds a nice flavor to the result.

Oh, and this makes about 2 quarts of chili when cooked down to a medium
texture.

Eat your heart out, Jeff Smith.

That Lary you mention in connection with the Colorado Springs Chili
cook off? That isn't by any chance the utterly legendary Richie Lary,
the man who had the old jail doors on his cubie in the Mill, bars
and all? The man who had SYSTEMS WIZARD printed on his business card?
(Echoed by the nearly-as-legendary Anton Chernoff, who's going around
with Systems Thaumaturge on his...) Well, shet my mouth! There were
giants in the earth in those days, kids.
