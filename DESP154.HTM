Oh, woe! Have I been taking hits this month! Where's your &lt;winter holiday
of your choice&gt; spirit?

On the strength of one glancing mention of the Sp*t Br**k S*ng*rs, we
lost an old subscriber with a huffy letter about Desperado turning
into a choral society notes file. On the strength of shortening
forwarding lists, I got howls from a few originators who never
intended their contribution to make it into Desperado at all.
And on the strength of a glancing mention of a new product, I got
a letter which I'm going to include in damn near its entirety.
It says things we have to remember.

Look, I'm not in this to make people miserable, including myself.
I'm not here to puff off concerts, or play a record of my own
prejudices, principles, and tastes, beyond publishing what I
think is funny *at the time*. And that's not even my editorial
policy, that's handed down from the Grand Old Man. But let's get a
few things straight.

As far as choral societies go, I'll mention them only if relevant to
the matter at hand. You may have noticed that my personal life has
been showing up less and less in recent issues. Tom told me to stay out
of it, and I'm doing my best. But I am the editor, so I can't stay
out of it entirely. Some of Tom's most memorable issues were his most
personal. I remember the issue he sent round after the death of his
father as the most moving writing I've seen on the net.

As far as forwarded stuff goes, I'm going to try something new.
I don't think anybody wants to read great lists of forwarding matter,
so I'm going to cut forwarding lists consistently to the originator
and the person who forwarded the item to me. If you're the originator,
and you want to know the full history of your item's travels, send me
mail. Make it quick though, I delete sources after about a week.

And as far as company confidential material goes, look at the new masthead.
And read the next letters. They do go on a bit, but QUARK::LIONEL
and Sluggo make good points. You know that Desperado is an expression of
the network here at Digital. So use your head before you forward something
to a few friends -- chances are good that if it's funny, it's going to end up
on my doorstep. And if it's funny, chances are I'm going to publish it. I
can't ask each originator if I can publish their item in Desperado --
who has the time?

Wow. Flame off. May 1987 find you wherever you most want to be.

Subj:   Credit where credit is due, and other myths

    The item in DESPERADO #1141 that was the "Great Karnak" routine
(curses and jokes) bothers me for two reasons.  The first reason is
unfortunately all too commonplace - good jokes and other items get
forwarded around the net very quickly, and some people decide to remove
the evidence of the original author - either for conciseness, or whatever
other reasons they may have.  If the item tickles the fancy of any of
the possible hundreds or thousands of readers, they may send it on
to DESPERADO.  You, having no idea of the true origin of the text,
publish it, making it seem as if it was the contributor's creation.

In this case, this collection of jokes was created by Kathy Hornbach and
several people in the Technical Languages and Environments group as the
basis for the Languages and Tools SIG skit at fall DECUS.  Afterwards,
Kathy circulated the amassed jokes to our group - and no doubt more than
one person forwarded it to their friends.  I don't mind seeing the jokes
published in DESPERADO (with one exception to be named later), but I do
feel that the origin should be included.  I suppose this means that you
should ask contributors to try to determine the authorship of items they
pass on to you, and to include that information if they have it.  I'd
also suggest that people ask the author for permission to send items
to DESPERADO.

The second problem is one particular joke, which CERTAINLY did not get
told at DECUS - that's the one about &lt;SECRET PROJECT--ed. note&gt;.
&lt;SECRET PROJECT&gt;is a very sensitive project and general knowledge of the
very existence of the project may hurt the corporation.  Yes, there have
been rumors in the press, but they are confused and contradictory.  I
know DESPERADO reaches outside of DEC, and having nuggets like this spread
who-knows-where worries me a lot.

I perhaps am particularly sensitive about this because I got bitten by
this problem myself some years ago when Tom Parmenter was around.  I
had attended a technical presentation on a new hardware and software
development project (which eventually turned out to be the MicroVAX I and
VAXELN respectively).  I wrote a review of this presentation and
circulated it to my group.  About a week later, I was astonished to find
my memo reproduced verbatim in DESPERADO, but my name at the end and
other identifying information had been removed - it appeared as if the
contributor (whom I did not send the memo to) had written the review
himself.  I was also alarmed because of the complete detail of unnanounced
products that was now spread far and wide, including some jokes that some
of the project developers may not have taken kindly to.

I never found out who forwarded my memo to this other person who then
plagiarized it for DESPERADO, but I have since taken to including
"Do not forward" on memos I distribute that contain sensitive information.

I'm not asking you to try to run down the authorship of every contribution.
But I am asking you to ask your readers to be concerned about crediting
sources, and to try to keep company-sensitive information out of DESPERADO.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Mea culpa. It's not the contributors who were at fault here, it was me, cutting
injudiciously for reasons of space. See introductory blurb for new policy.

To:     BOOKIE::NEILSEN
Subj:   to the editor

I have a complaint, albeit a very, very minor one (although if you start
publishing more and more stuff from VNS, the complaints will get louder!).

In the most recent issue, you included something I sent around to my
small, parochial little list.  You (meaning Desperado) weren't on the
original distribution, and I didn't include you on the theory that the
distribution was already pretty large and that you'd probably seen it
already.  I don't mind that this stuff gets forwarded around after I
do it (after all, I forward stuff that comes from other sources and
mostly without permission), although I'm curious about the torturous path
it follows before landing in your mailbag.

The complaint (remember that?) is that you made it seem like I originated
the thing.  I didn't; I did shorten the forwarding list somewhat before
I sent it out again, but that's all I did.  I'd rather give credit (and
sometimes the blame) where it belongs, especially when the originator
is inside the company and likely to see Desperado in some form or other.
It makes me uncomfortable to see something come out under my name when
I didn't do anything to make it seem like it's mine.

What's your practice on much-forwarded stuff?  I seem to remember Parmenter
saying something that he didn't like publishing much-forwarded stuff on
the theory that everybody has seen it already; do you follow the same
policy, or do you judge them on a case by case basis?

Aside from this minor nit, I like Desperado, and always look forward to
the next issue (and wish that they came more frequently).  I have to admit
that I rarely see stuff in it that I've seen elsewhere, except when you
publish stuff from VNS (the letters section of which resembles nothing
so much as the cacophony of kindergarten at finger-painting time).
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Okay, no VNS stuff. Point well taken, although VNS's new letters policy makes
the juggernaut more readable, especially if you can follow cricket reporting.

And for the *reductio ad absurdum*, we turn the stage over to FIZBIN::BINDER,
old veteran of the net that he is:

Subj:   Rumor, rumor, who's got the rumor?

Corporate information and security?  We're worried about keeping the lid on
when we send things over the net?  We'd damned well better be, and that ain't
the only way damaging rumors get out.  Witness the following, culled from an
independent publication.  I've edited out all product and place names, whether
they are real or not, to protect both the innocent and the not-so-innocent
equally.  I may have changed the sense a little, but I invite you to count the
number of bracketed insertions I've made.

Read and shudder.

                                *************

                [The article begins with irrelevant blather.]

...I was first introduced to a senior developer from DEC's [Facility XYZ],
home of {Product X] and other fine [things].  Several drinks later, he
confided that his pals in the [Mumble] group are writing [fantastic software]
that will [work wonders] across all DEC [products].

We were soon joined by a [Facility ABC] honcho who affirmed my prognostication
about the [new product Z].  But he became evasive when I suggested that the
[new product Z] is a stopgap for [new product ZZ].  Pointing east towards [out
there], he said that [new product Z]'s successors...can be [made useful] only
by [new product ZZZ].

Dancing to [some kind] music with a [certain] guru, I learned that a group of
[certain] developers at DEC's [Facility 123] is busy crafting an [excellent
new product].  They may be up to even more, the lady opined, because DEC is
[doing something or other].  The guru couldn't say when DEC's [new whiz-bang]
will be served up to [prospective] users.

                                *************

There was a lot more like what I've eviscerated here.  I don't know about the
rest of the Desperadim, but I'm of the opinion that the people mentioned in
this article ought to be handed their walking papers.  Passing rumors like
these, whether they're true or not, is guaranteed to do severe damage to DEC -
if the information is true, it gives the competition a jump; if it's false, it
creates a credibility gap you could drop a VAX 8800 into.  Either way, we all
lose.

It's the same when we send information over the net without making sure of who
will, or who will NOT, see it.

On FUGU sashimi...      I live in Tokyo and I've tried it. It's 'overrated'
It's very expensive - a cheap set dinner is up from $60 a serving. It also
has a bland taste (everyone said its supposed to be delicious) they serve
it with a dipping sauce with lime and scallion in it - and radish - so that's
the taste.
        You do NOT get an LSD like high off the stuff. It's only served in
winter when the blowfish is supposed to have less toxin. It can only be
served by specially licensed resturants - since the toxin is in the fish liver
and it's only safe if the fish is cleaned properly. I guess they do lose a
few people each year from eating it - but usually people who prepared
it themselves.
        When served, they slice it transparently thin and make impressive
arrangements out of it (things like chrysanthemum flowers). So it's pretty,
high status, expensive and bland. (Once was enough for me).

"Give me a tall ship and a computer to steer her by" - by Jay
Spencer

Kookaburra III, the leading contender to become the Australian
defender of the America's Cup is a floating computer.  She and her
sister, Kookaburra II, were designed and built around Digital
Equipment Corporation MicroVAX II computers.  The on-board computers
monitor wind speeds and directions, ocean currents and sail
performance to provide real-time information to the crews and match
the data with historical information.

At the Taskforce 87 syndicate headquarters in Perth, the much larger
Digital VAX 11-750 collects and crunches the numbers on which the
Kookaburra strategy is based.  The 750 is the heart of a DECnet
which constantly monitors wind speeds and directions from three
islands and three buoys close to the America's Cup course.  The
Meteorological Office operates the island weather stations, but
Taskforce collaborated with other syndicates to place and run the
buoys.

The DECnet network links all the Taskforce computers except the one
on each of the 12-metre yachts.  Just before the starter's gun, the
key information for each race is stored on a floppy disk on the
tender craft and thrown across to the racing yacht.  "Yachting is
still a gentlemen's sport," said Mr Chris Todter, the electronics
project manager for Taskforce.  Mr. Todter explained that, although
it was possible to include the two contenders in the telemetry
system, the syndicate was keen to avoid accusation of cheating.

Instead of feeding the strategic data to the on-board computer
through a telemetry system before the start of the race, the
syndicate preferred physically throwing the flopping disk to the
crew.  That avoided any allegations that syndicate staff was
illegally communicating with the crew during a race, Mr Todter said.
Mr. Todter's main task is devising a strategy based on historical
information gathered by computer-based monitoring systems.  The
floppy disk that is thrown to the crew before the race contains
programs and information that can anticipate, even predict, wind
changes and other developments using information collected by
monitoring equipment on board the yacht.

A computer is even used to design and cut the sails for the
Kookaburra sisters.  Other computers do a variety of tasks.
Skipper Iain Murray, however, is unlikely to endorse the comment of
Digital marketing manager, Mr Nick Ramensky, that high technology
will retain the America's Cup for Australia.

Digital's gamble is almost as big as the Taskforce 87 syndicates.
The United States computer company originally invested only $40,000
in equipment in the Taskforce syndicate, put together by Perth
entrepreneur Mr Kevin Parry.  That has since grown to $250,000, and
the Taskforce syndicate would dearly like to upgrade the VAX 11-750
for a much larger 850 [I guess they mean 8500 - ed].

The decision to back Taskforce was made by Digital's Pacific
regional headquarters, which is almost totally manned by
Australians.  Digital's US head office was notified after the event
and began an inquiry to find out what other commitments had been
made to America's Cup challenge.  Five other Digital branches had
contributed to America's Cup challenges, including the California
district, which is heavily behind the San Diego Yacht Club which has
Mr Dennis Conner as skipper.

Digital Australia is already drawing up plans to invite top US
executives and major clients to Perth for the final series of races
whether or not Kookaburra III is the defender.

None of the competing yachts have the same technological edge as
Kookaburra III and Kookaburra II.  Other crews take on board
personal computers to help out.  They have IBM-compatible PCs which
have less than one quarter of the power of the Micro VAX II
computers built into the Kookaburra yachts.   The Taskforce
syndicate built the computers into their 12-metre yachts.  The team
of computer and other specialists led by Mr Todter continuously
improve the high technology.  Though go-ahead has been given for
competing yachts to use sails carrying their sponsors' names, the
Kookaburra yachts have three prominent black bands across their
sails.

The black ribbons are not for appearance's sake.  On top of the mast
is a video camera which uses the black bands to monitor the
performance of the sails and give the crew read-outs.  Information
from the camera is digested so that navigator can read from the
on-board computer how the sail is operating.  The same information
is stored to help in the design of new sails.  Three mainsails,
costing up to $28,000 each, are required by the Kookaburra syndicate
every week.  They are designed on the same microcomputer that
operates the cutting equipment in the sail room.

One wonders what the Prince of Wales would have to say about all this. He was
the one who came up with the idea of the 12-metre yacht when he found that
the private fortune of the Saxe-Coburgs couldn't compete with the public
funds of Germany that Kaiser Wilhelm was using to buy boats that would whip
the crown off the P. of W.

And I wonder whatever happened to sailing!
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
And speaking of the net, did anyone else hear the closest thing the
computer culture has to a warhorse? I refer to that fine old Gilbert &amp;
Sullivan parody "I've built a better model than the one at Data General",
last seen in these pages in Desperado #1113, the issue of May 18, 1985.
It was sung on Prairie Home Companion by Michael Cooney, the man who
knows more songs than there are. Just goes to show that the net is so
insecure stuff can migrate to public radio with only a two-year
lead time. Those people are really on the ball.

Although they appear to have troubles of their own. Read on...

This was supposed to be a &lt;winter holiday of your choice&gt; issue, and
the next contribution would have been both amusing and relevant. As it
is, let me add only, if you must drink and cook, appoint
somebody as the designated baker.

    Before you start, sample the rum and check for quality.  Good isn't
    it?  Now go ahead.  Select a large mixing bowl, measuring cup, etc.,
    and check the rum again for quality.  It must be just right!  With
    an electric mixer, beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.
    Add 1 teaspoon sugar and beat again; meanwhile, make sure the rum
    is of the finest quality.  Add 2 large eggs and 2 cups of fried
    fruit and beat until very high.  If the fruit gets stuck in the
    beaters, just pry it loose with a screw driver.  Sample the rum
    again, checking for consistency.  Next, sift in 3 cups baking powder
    and a pinch of rum, 1 seaspoon toda and 1 cup pepper or salt.  Anyway,
    don't dret.  Just sample the rum again and mist in 1/2 pint of lemon
    juice, fold in chopped buttermilk and the strained nuts.  Tample
    rum again.  Now 1 bablespoon srown sugar, or whatever color is
    available.  Mix well.  Grease oven and curn on the cake pan to 350
    degrees.  Pour the whole mess in the oven.  Cake tum rake out after
    mifty finutes.
