        If 93 per cent of the American people think the Branch Davidians
        brought it all on themselves, as discovered by a scientific poll
        in USA Today, I haven't met any of them.  Peter Jennings (a
        Canadian) certainly thinks so.  His special report the night of
        the massacre was titled "Choosing to Die".

        Those crazy Branch Davidians.  They thought the federal
        government was their enemy and out to get them and that they
        would all die. Such an idea!

        In their eight-month planning process for the raid, the BATF
        failed to learn that David Koresh frequently jogged alone, out of
        sight of the compound in the early morning hours.

        In their eight-month planning process, the BATF concluded that
        since the Branch Davidians were a church, they should be raided
        on a Sunday morning.  The planning process failed to turn up the
        fact that the Branch Davidians are a branch of the Seventh Day
        Adventists, so called because of their belief that Saturday is
        the Sabbath.

        The BATF could not plan their way into a pay toilet with a nickel
        head start.  And the FBI could not plan their way back out
        without a tank.

        The most pathetic sight:  The BATF flag -- a 2x3 black rectangle
        with the letters BATF on it -- flying over the ashes of the
        compound while Texas Rangers searched for bodies.

        The most pathetic statement, uttered as tanks bashed down the
        walls and fired tear-gas inside, "This is not an attack!  This is
        not an attack!"  Talk about believing in the power of words to
        shape reality.

        That is not to say that David Koresh didn't have a "death wish"
        or a "martyr complex" or all those things Peter Jennings thinks
        he had, but why should the feds cooperate so enthusiastically?

                                    =*=

        I saw one federal geezer declaiming to a press conference, "We
        can't allow religious fanatics who think the end of the world is
        coming to arm themselves."  We can't?  And why not?  Who is to
        say?

        There are hundreds, thousands of cults.  Most firearms are legal.
        If you think the Branch Davidians were dangerous, read up on the
        Mormons some time.

        If I'm an enthusiastic Christian with a sawed-off shotgun can I
        expect to be invaded by lamebrained federal lawmen with tanks and
        recorded Buddhist chants?  Can I expect to die?

        Last year they accused Koresh of assaulting a rival Branch
        Davidian and siezed all his firearms.  They were not able to
        convict on the assault charge and the guns were returned.  Hence
        the totally illegal trial, conviction, and seizure of weapons by
        means of fire and publicity.

                                    =*=

        Whose tank was that?  Was it an *FBI* tank?  What is the FBI
        doing with a tank?

                                    =*=

        And where is the public outcry?

BIOGRAPHY OF "DILBERT" ARTIST SCOTT ADAMS

I'm often asked what horrible events in my past caused me to be the
cartoonist I am today.  Here is my abbreviated biography and some
answers to the most frequently asked questions.

The Early Years

Born 6/8/57.  Raised in upstate New York.  Graduated valedictorian
because I was the only person who could spell "valedictorian." Began
actively doodling.  Became addicted to Peanuts books and Mad
magazines.  Decided to become a professional cartoonist at about age
six, but gave the notion up at age twelve when I found out it was
impossible.

Education

- Hartwick College, Oneonta New York, BA in economics, 1979.
- University of California at Berkeley, MBA, 1986.
- Certified Hypnotist, Clement School of Hypnosis, San Francisco,
1981.

Where I Live

In my senior year of college my car broke down on a desolate road in
upstate New York.  It was the middle of night and the middle of
winter.  I had arrogantly neglected to bring a coat.  I was miles
from civilization.  As I jogged along the road that night, wondering
if I would die, I promised myself that if I survived I would sell my
car for a one-way ticket to California and never see snow again.

Eventually a car came along and saved me.  That spring I sold my car
for a one-way ticket to California.  I've never been back to upstate
New York and I've never been in snow since.

Now I live in Dublin, California, about 35 miles east of San
Francisco.

Day Jobs

Crocker National Bank, San Francisco, 1979 to 1986, working in a
number of humiliating and low paying jobs including:  teller (robbed
twice at gunpoint), computer programmer, financial analyst, product
manager, and commercial lender.

Pacific Bell, San Ramon, California, 1986 to present (yeah, still
there).  Worked in a number of jobs that defy description but all
involve technology and finances.  Currently working in a laboratory
environment.

Why Do I Still Have My Day Job?

You never really have enough money.  Also, it's where I get my
material for the strip.  And I like playing with the technology.

Art Training

I took one drawing class in college and got the lowest grade in the
class.  Everything I know is just trial and error and lots of
doodling.  This probably comes as no big surprise to anybody.

How I Became a Syndicated Cartoonist

On the advice of a kind cartoonist I bought a book called "1988
Artist Markets" and followed the instructions on how to get
syndicated.  I drew fifty sample strips and mailed copies to the
major cartoon syndicates.  United Media called a few weeks later and
offered a contract.  I accepted.

Dilbert was launched in 1989 after several months of further
developing the strip.  This was my first cartooning for profit.

Where Did Dilbert and Dogbert Come From?

Dilbert is a composite of my co-workers over the years.  He emerged
over time as the main character of my doodles.  I started using him
in business presentations and got great responses.  A co-worker
suggested the name.  Dogbert was created later just so Dilbert would
have somebody to talk to.

Are You Like Dilbert?

It depends who you ask.  We share a love of technology and have a
similar dating history.  But I spend more time in the gym.

Dogbert's personality is an exaggerated version of my own.  He says
the things I would say if I didn't fear retribution and had lots of
time to think up clever responses.

What's the Story With Dilbert's Necktie?

It looks normal to me.  I don't know what you're talking about.

Subj:   Test your IQ

For desperado...

I recently saw a TV ad for a new 900 number service.  The idea is you
call this 900 number and they ask you a bunch of "True or False"
questions which you answer with your touch-tone key pad.  At the end,
they tell you your IQ.  They advertise the service as accurate and
scientific.

The ad concludes so:  Dial 1-900-244-SMART; that's 1-900-244-7627.

Just how low an IQ do you have to have to be unable to make the
translation between the mnemonic phone number and the digits?

A correspondent writes:

   "When William Henry Harrison was this far into his administration,
   he'd been dead for 68 days!"

Subj:   Does this sound familiar?

I have an Encyclopedia Britanica calendar that included the following nugget.

  The Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely (1925-1991) built machines-like moving
  sculptures that destroyed themselves in the course of their operation.
  In 1960, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, he demonstrated
  his first such sculpture, 27 feet high and containing a complicated
  assemblage of motors and wheels; failing to self-destruct, it started
  a fire and had to be dispatched by firemen with axes.  The next two,
  entitled "Study for an End to the World" successfully detonated
  themselves with explosives.

I had never considered that the Survival Research Laboratories might be a
throwback to some earlier effort.  BTW, whatever happened to SRL?  Is it
true that a video was made of some of their events?

Note that the Steve Roberts lifestyle is nomadic, but only rarely
"backcountry".  He seems to prefer the luxury and socialization of
civilized areas, and his 600-pound bike is pretty much limited to
well-paved surfaces.  He carries complete camping gear on the bike, but
its use seems to be only for occasions when he can't find a "friend"
with a spare room.  And he has a data base that probably has thousands
of people in it by now, so he's rarely far from someone who can offer
him a roof and a meal.

There are several sources of additional information about Steve Roberts:

Technomads is a email discussion group started by Steve. Send subscription
request to:

technomads-request@bikelab.corp.sun.com

Not automated - you may have to wait a few days to get action from the
busy administrator.  Steve plays no direct role in administering the
list, but reads it regularly.  The person who does administer it is
busy and not directly involved, so don't bother him except for
subscribe/unsubscribe requests.  This is a fairly active interactive
list at times.  Topics range from discussions of the problems and joys
of the nomadic life style to detailed discussions of bike (and now
microship) electronics.  I expect that this group will soon be active
parcipants in the microship design and build activity.  To quote
Steve's latest newsletter:

"The boat design is continuing to evolve, still a kayak-based trimaran,
but now using a drop-in recumbent as drivetrain as well as something
approaching 500 watts of solar panels.  "

Steve's semi-periodical publication "Nomadness Notes", previously
called "Notes from the Bikelab" is sent to another list called
nomadness, to which you subscribe by sending a note to

nomadness-request@caliban.corp.sun.com

This list is used *only* for sending this publication - no other traffic.

There is also an anonymous ftp site which has back issues and other
writings by and about Steve, and a few .gif photos of Steve and
BEHEMOTH.  It's at telebit.com  in the /pub/nomad directory

And as someone already mentioned, Steve can be reached directly as
wordy@lorien.qualcomm.com.

I recommend his book "Computing across America".  If it hasn't sold out,
you can find out how to order it by messaging Steve.

The Canberra Times
                                CORRECTION
For some considerable time, The Canberra Times has been publishing the wrong
tide times for Narooma.  The error has been in arithmetical calculation in
this office of the difference between tide times at Fort Denison as published
in standard tide tables and times at Narooma.  The error, the source of which
is lost in antiquity, was discovered last week when the editor, relying on
The Canberra Times figures, was swept out to sea.  But he managed to return
to shore - and ordered this correction.

The Direct Marketing Association maintains a database listing people that
prefer to not receive unsolicited marketing material.  I've had my name and
address added to this list, hoping it would reduce my mail.  It seems to
have had just the opposite effect recently - I just received a mailing from
Sears that begins:

     not to receive various solicitations through the mail, ..."

Subject: IMITATION

A friend of mine saw the following on a package of "DeBole's All Natural
Imitation Spaghetti":

"The word IMITATION must be used because we do not artificially enrich
our Organically Grown Durum Whole Wheat Flour, which is required by the
Code of Federal Regulations, in order to be called a macaroni product."

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Similarly intellectual regulations prohibit products without
        cholesterol from advertising that fact because of the belief that
        the moronic public will read "no cholesterol" as "no fat".

        On the other hand, fat content of food products is listed in
        grams of fat, not calories, so that you must multiply the number
        of grams times 9 (calories per gram) and divide by total calories
        to get the percentage of fat.  That is, the gram number sounds
        low, but the percentage number much more accurately reflects the
        fat content of the food.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        Like a black beetle in amber, preserved since late spring or early
        summer, and somewhat out of date even then, the above Desperado is
        presented for your approbation and entertainment.  This will be
        the last of the old series of thousand-liners presented perhaps
        once a month (when things were going right) to be followed by a
        new series, considerably shorter and more frequent.  I am under no
        pressure to end Desperado and as far as I know I am at no greater
        risk of layoff than any other Digital employee, it's just that I
        haven't had the time to produce Desperados in the old style and I
        don't see that changing, so hang on for the new style.  And, yes,
        numerologists, there will be a new numbering sequence.

        But, how come there is no national outrage about the Waco mssacre
        anyway?  This thing would have been out of date the day after it
        happened.
