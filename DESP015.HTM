The funniest thing I ever saw in a Dec manual occured in the RSTS/E
System Generation manual for V6C or V7.0 (don't remember which).

Lookup "Hidden Sysgen Options" in the index.  It refers to Appendix
J1 (or somesuch).  This reads:

                Hidden Sysgen Options

TELECOM AM Digest    Thursday, 23 September 1982   Volume 2 : Issue 123

From: John R. Covert &lt;RSX-DEV at DEC-MARLBORO&gt;
Subject: Incredible Translation screw-up in Nashua, NH

Customers in Nashua who misdial calls to Manchester (the error is to
include the 603 NPA [area code] as part of the call) are being routed over the
Foreign Exchange lines installed in DEC's Merrimack/Nashua CENTREX.
It seems that the 3-digit translator entry for normal customers for
603, which should point to error recording (since you aren't allowed
to dial your own NPA in NH) points to DEC's translator for 603, used
to automatically route calls to the Manchester area over the FX.

This is due to be fixed today (I discovered it yesterday) and applied
to calls from all Nashua/Hudson NXXs [exchange]  except 888.  The "correct"
way to dial Manchester is 1+7D or 0+7D; calls went on the FX if dialed with
1+603+7D, 0+603+7D (no stop at TSPS along the way), or 603+7D.  When
calling from a pay station, the call, normally a toll call, routed on
the FX and returned the dime at the end of the call.

DEC, of course, had to pay for all the local calls in Manchester and
also incurred other costs, since the FX lines were unavailable which
caused calls to be routed over WATS.  (Fortunately calls from the
outside phones went to reorder, rather than WATS, when the FXs were
busy.)

This error may have existed for years.

 "Noted newspaperman, editor and publisher I.F. Stone examines the questions:
how could a great democracy condemn a philosopher to death? And why would a
legendary journalistic gadfly and political activist devote five years of his
retirement to learning Greek and studying classical texts in pursuit of the
answer? The implications of these questions merit your attention."

One bit of radio trivia, and one correction:

WSNE in Providence, is Southern New England.

And, there is one more radio station (and TV station) EAST of the
Mississippi whose call letters start with K -- KYW in Philadelphia.
This radio station has been an all-news station for as long as I can
remember, at least 20 years.  They've also, I believe, been around
for a very long time, certainly since before the rule about stations
east of the Mississippi having their call letters start with W.

Subject: Irregular Verbs - Yet another contest

The game of irregular verbs, I am told, first received widespread attention when
Bertrand Russell introduced it to his British radio audience; apparently, back
in the '50's, BBC ran a "Intellectuals discuss things" kind of a show, and
Russell was a regular participant.  (I'm sure some of the British Desperadoes
can provide details...)

The game can be learned easily from a couple of examples.  Thus:

I am a gourmet.  YOU are a gourmand.  HE is eating with both feet in the
trough.  I design.  YOU code.  HE hacks.

I understand this game.  YOU could learn.  HE hasn't a prayer.

I've heard many more, but will hold them back a bit to see what others come up
with.

The most atrocious headline I ever saw belonged to the new Herald
American (what else?).  It happened just after the whole silly paper
went tabloid.

                RAPE JUDGE ON HOT SEAT!

Now, is the word 'rape' a verb or an adjective?  Also, it was an
indecently cavalier way to report on the travesty of justice that
occurred when those 5 men got their wrists slapped after raping
that woman.

Along the lines of silly script lines (movie or otherwise), the silliest
thing I've heard in a while belongs to the STAR TREK episode in which
the landing party finds this planet on which resides this cloud that
smells sickly sweet and has a habit of attacking folks.  After finding
one of it's victims, Mr. McCoy kneels, passes his tricorder over the
body for 2 seconds, then stares away while muttering," Every cell in his
body has been disrupted..".  Kirk then goes bonkers trying to kill the
cloud because he took a thorn out of it's paw or some such nonsense....

        One of my brothers is a newspaper editor. He and the
other editors and writers play a game called "Headlines"
while they wait for the first copies (laden with errors) to
come off the presses. The idea is to come up with The
Ultimate Headline. Most of the headlines are things like,

                WORLD WAR THREE DECLARED!!

or,

                WORLD WAR THREE IS OVER!!

        (I think the second one had a sub-heading, "U.S.
Loses in Overtime.")

        Then, of course, there were NATIONAL ENQUIRER style
headlines, like the one suggested by the eminent comedian
George Carlin:

        JEANNE DIXON PREDICTS:

                JACKIE TO WED IN U F O!!

        And there were variations on the N.Y. DAILY NEWS's
headline of a few years ago, about Gerry Ford's not bailing
out New York City. But the one that finally stopped the game
-- yessiree, the Ultimate Headline of All Time -- was:

        A friend at Parker Bros. recently came up with these two gems I must
   share:

        Q: What is the last thing that goes thru a bug's mind when it
           hits your windshield?

        A: Its asshole.

   I used to be sick every time a bug splattered its body all over my
   windshield.  I chuckle now.

        The other one:

        Q: What is the difference between erotic and perverse?

        A: With "erotic", you use a feather.
           With "perverse", you use the whole chicken.

Ever wondered what makes the good ol' U. S. of A. so great?

Where else could a millionaire run for election to the highest office in the
land and get matching funds from the poor?

Subject: I remember Leonid...

Well, I don't REALLY remember Leonid Brezhnev, but I remember a story
-- from Hedrick Smith's fine book THE RUSSIANS, I think -- about
Brezhnev and his mother, shortly after the ouster of Chairman K.

        Brezhnev sent a limousine to pick up his mother. She was taken
to all the best shops, the ones reserved for Party members -- and
bought all kinds of things. Then her limousine drove her into the
countryside outside Moscow, and to a splendid dacha by a glistening
lake -- the house had once been a hideaway for a lover of Catherine
the Great's. She was given an exquisite lunch of blinis with real
cream, and an omelete made with caviar from the Black Sea. Her tea was
laced with, not cheap, harsh Caspian brandy, but imported French
cognac, and served in cut glass made by Faberge for a dissolute Duke,
a cousin of Alexander III's. Finally, Leonid flew in on his helicopter
from the Kremlin.
        "Well, Mother. How do you like your new house?"
        "New house!" Mrs. Brezhnev exclaimed. Dizzy and dazzled she
gawked in amazement at all the splendor her son was now able to give
her.
        "But Leonid," she whispered nervously, "what if the
Bolsheviks come back?"
