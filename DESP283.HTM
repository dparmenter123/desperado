 I never expected Dave Barry to include an http address.  Got
 caught. Caught once by a Fulghum article too.  As for IBM and OS/2,
 evidently they were merely writing off the consumer market, not the
 whole operating system.  Yet.

 "The Net": Sandra Bullock is irresistably adorable and keen in peril,
 but the net stuff in the movie was purest b6t, of course.  Of a
 perilous virus, Bullock warns, "Keep your finger off the escape
 button." She and another computer genius refer to what we call
 "mode'ms" as "mod-ems".  Although she was supposed to be a genius of
 network security, Bullock was locked out from access by changing her
 password on just one system where she worked.  In order to get back
 on she had to go to the office and sit at the actual terminal.  Some
 security genius.

 All network hacking in the moview was performed at an interface
 apparently based on the America OnLine.  Plenty o' laffs for insiders
 like us.  Still, Sandra is so adorable that she even makes the
 pukemaking Dennis Miller slightly attractive.

 The chases and suspense scenes were great.  Everyone wants Sandra.

                                 =*=

 The gimmick in "The Net" was that the dominant network security
 software, called GateKeeper (I stuck the capital K in there for
 authenticity, but the movie had none such), was actually a security
 hole being exploited by some net terrorist group called the
 Pythagoreans or the Parthians.  I wonder what easter eggs are in
 Netscape?

 I celebrated the metastasis of Netscape by downloading the
 Quarterdeck Internet Suite (http://www.qdeck.com), which promises
 superior features to what they call "the blinking browser",
 particularly in URL management.

 To install Netscape I had to acquire Netscape, Trumpet Winsock,
 TIA, and four "helper"utilities and then engage a guru to link
 them all together.  This is not a three-billion-dollar product, it is
 a rinky-dink app that can't stand alone for a second.  Of course, to
 install the Quarterdeck Suite I need to find out something about a
 bunch of stuff I have only vaguely heard of, my "servers": POP, SMTP
 and NNTP, and plug 'em in to an installation procedure that tells me
 nothing about any of these things.

 Somebody, could be Bill Gates, but it need not be, could be you, dear
 reader, is going to put a browser together that installs, works, and
 does what we want it to.

 Gates may win with MicroSoft Network, but I doubt any of these
 services could withstand a browser like that.  Straight Internet/Web
 access is almost always mo' fun than anything offered by the online
 services and moderated conversation and guest appearances just aren't
 worth the money.  The services just won't be able to evolve fast
 enough and who needs im when you've got Yahoo? (Now there's a stock
 I'd like to own a piece of the IPO of).

 I bought an HTML book published last January that had whole chapters
 on Mosaic and one paragraph on Netscape.  Next January's book will
 doubtless be full of Netscape, but by then Quarterdeck or someone
 else may have blown them away.

 The thing I like about HTML (hypertext, more or less) is that neither
 the authoring tool nor the display tool is of any importance.  I
 don't see how Netscape can ever pay off.

 On the other hand, the company was clearly set up to storm Wall
 Street, ex execs of other companies team with genius to set world on
 ear.  It's a pretty picture.

                                 =*=

 I've finally got a mnemonic for pathname syntax:  PCs are backwards
 and so are their slashes.

                                 =*=

 Damned if I remember where I saw this:  "If you think you own your
 hard disk, you're in for a shock."

I've seen this function before with the name WOW attached to it, as in
WOW(1)=1, WOW(2)=4, WOW(3)=7625597484987, etc.  It occasionally comes up in
discussions about growth rates of functions.  There are functions that
grow linearly, grow as some polynomial, and grow exponentially.  People
tend to think of exponential rates as the fastest kind of growth.  As
pointed out, exponential growth is only Order 3.  Things like # are Order
4, while functions like WOW are _infinite_ order, i.e. grow faster
than any Order n function for all n.

Of course, in one sense it's a mistake to think of this as really fast; as
anyone who has studied Set Theory to the point of learning about
inaccessible cardinals can tell you, this isn't even the tip of the
iceberg.  On the other hand, if one searches for meaning in mathematics
(sometimes--but not always--recommended), it's going too far.  I've yet to
see a "real-life" significance for Order 4 functions much less things like
WOW.  I definitely like to ponder such things, but I usually label them
mathematical philosophy.

Um, Tom...  how about something for us creative types, you know the ones,
love opera, do watercolour for relaxation, graphic arts and desktop
publishing for a living, got honours grades in the Humanities, and flunked
Math and Chem miserably...  have mercy, will ya?

Say, did you hear?  For real!  Pacific Bell has laid off Scot Adams of
Dilbert fame, after nine years of service, citing financial constraints, the
usual Bulls*t...  wonder if he needed the money, or kept working simply to
have fodder for his cartoon strip...

Trying to remember his E-mail user name to send "condolences"...  he's on
AOL, like me... and I've corresponded with him...  but "old age" is getting
to my memory cells...

So, enough with the googols already, and let's talk fonts, or bezier
curves...

 How'd you like that order 4 stuff, Marina?  And, oh how sly to ask we
 leave the technoid googol behind for the creative fonts and bezier
 curves.

 I was experimenting with bundling answers so you who so fear the
 power of the googol as to be unable to read of him and his
 goo-goo-googly eyes could skip over, confident of missing nothing but
 the googol.

 Scott Adams, victim of the one-man economy layoff, posts his
 address of scottadams@aol.com in every Sunday strip.  I personally am
 boycotting all Pacific Bell products.
