As a secondary distribution recipient of Desperado, I have to ask myself
what's happened over the last several issues. The old Desperado used to
be funny, witty and provoked interesting responses from around the world.
Lately, it's been so wrapped up in obscure topics as to appeal to a very
small audience - at least that's the impression here. How many people are
into choral societies, for example? In Ayr, I know of one person only, out
of 700+, who is even interested in serious singing - I exclude from this
definition all rugby supporters, but maybe the merits of rugby songs could
at least inject some interest into Desperado once more.

A medium for lighthearted intercourse is one thing, a mutual admiration
society is quite another.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I've gotten a couple of messages lately complaining that Desperado isn't any
fun any more, that there's too much emphasis on New England choral societies,
and not enough talk about good stuff, unspecified.

Remember what Desperado is for: it's for WHATEVER you want to talk about.
If I mention a piece of music and people respond, then I assume that's what
they want to talk about. I print just about everything I'm sent, unless it
offends my peculiar scruples, or has been heavily forwarded, or I push the
DELETE button too fast.

This issue has a marvellous piece about musical schlock in it; I hope it will
trigger a good discussion. The PDP-11 trivia sparked a tremendous flurry of
responses, but that ran its course. Talk to me about rugby and I'm sure you'll
be delighted with the outpourings.

But I'll tell you: criticisms will only be taken seriously if they are
accompanied by funny articles. Criticisms accompanied by very funny
articles will be taken very seriously. In other words, if you don't want to
hear about something, send me something else. I write part of Desperado
certainly, and if it's a slow news day, I'll be more a part of it than other
times. But it ain't just me sitting here in Zonker Kookie land talking into a
mirror. Desperado is you folks, and should be conducted in the style to which
you'd like to become accustomed.

Now, let the games begin!

          WHEN THE BRAIN SAYS "NUTS!" AND THE BLOOD SAYS "GOODIE!"

From:   BACH::BODGE        "Andy Bodge"

Subj:   Schlock?

I like Carmina Burana too.  In fact, it was a recording of same that
prompted me, several years ago, to visit a hifi store and spend a lot
of money on a better system.  dum dum dum dum .. THUNK .. dum dum dum dum ..
THUNK .. the old system could handle the dum dums OK but couldn't hack
the THUNKs.

But what prompts this is not CB but the word "schlock."  As applied to
literature, I think I understand it.  Schlock is when you feel ashamed
that you're reading it, and good schlock is schlock that you stay up all
night reading.  But that's a gut reaction based on lots of reading and
a judgement that a writer is, or is not, working hard at the craft.

With music, I don't know.  I like classical music that produces some
emotional response - awe, sorrow, joy, contentment.  At its best the
response is physiological as well as emotional.  I don't know why the
music does this; I don't have the education to know.  I just know that
I like the feeling I get.

Now, much of this music tends to fall into the "schlock" or "warhorse"
category -- CB, Tchaikovsky symphonies, "Scheherazade," that sort of
thing.  People Who Know make fun of a lot of the music I love.  Meanwhile,
"music" that sounds like the mating of schizoid grasshoppers is praised
to the skies.  I swear, only another musician or musicologist could
appreciate that stuff.

So, what is this "schlock" that I like so much?  Should I be ashamed, and
play it only on headphones to avoid giving offense?  Or is it, perhaps,
as great an achievement to write music that grabs the emotions as to
compose a work of stunning intellectual complexity?  I can respect the
effort that goes into the latter piece, but I can feel the former in
my gut.  From a musician's point of view, is it the equivalent of
trashy detective fiction? - or has familiarity (and perhaps its
appeal to the masses) bred contempt?
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I heard a marvellous radio program on schlock once, and it said that listening
to schlock was the musical equivalent of puppy love. It sets you up for the
"real thing", and it makes you feel either wonderful or terrible according to
your needs. It's easy to respond to, and once you've heard a warhorse, you
may feel like listening to some less accessible music by the same composer.
Listen to The Unfinished Symphony by Schubert, and before you know it, you'll
be listening to Death and the Maiden. OR NOT. It makes no difference. Easy
good music can be as rewarding and exhilarating as difficult good music, I
think.

And I'm with you on the physiological reaction to good music. Try singing
the Brahms Requiem in front of a really good basso sometime. Bypasses the
ears completely and goes straight to the spinal column.

Subj:   Carmina Burana

I have always enjoyed Carmina Burana as interpreted by the various choral
groups but I never hear it without thinking of a 1964 recording on Vangard
records by Sandy Bull.  He took the introduction and a few other bits and
made a 5 string banjo arrangement.  Very 60's, very haunting, and on the
same record with his arrangement of Ray Charles arrangement of "I've Got A
Woman".  Somehow at the time it all made sense.

The British philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russel enjoyed
playing with the connotations of words.  On a BBC radio program
called "The Brain Trust," Russell presented the following "conjugation"
of an "irregular verb":

  I am firm.
  You are obstinate.
  He is a pig-headed fool.

The New Statesman and Nation, quoting the above as a model, offered
prizes to readers who submitted the best "irregular verbs" based on
Russel's model.  Here are some of the entries as they appeared in the
June 5, 1984 issue:

  I am sparkling.
  You are unusually talkative.
  He is drunk.

  I am beautiful.
  You have quite good features.
  She isn't bad looking, if you like that type.

  I day dream.
  You are an escapist.
  He ought to see a psychiatrist.

  I have about me something of the subtle, haunting fragrance of the Orient.
  You rather overdo it, dear.
  She stinks.

I think that NEMO::GREEN_GIANT ought to go ahead and turn the Hubbard
Squash into a movie script. It should yeild a horror classic to rank
right up there with "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" . . . can't you just
see those warty pale green squash turning mushy, then starting to pulse
and to move, and then crawling out from under their vines on Halloween night,
wrapping their bony tendrils around the necks of unsuspecting trick-or-treaters
heading home . . . or maybe they pounce out and squash the kids on the
head, so to speak. If you want money, go for the movie script and talk to
Jamie Lee Curtis. I understand she screams well when pale green panting warty
things go flying at her head.

        A new yuppie pasta shop has opened up in a new yuppie mall in
these parts.  I boogied on down to get me some tortellini with fresh
basil (an in-joke for FORUM.NOT people).  Guess what they have on sale
there!
        A gallon jar with a lid on it.  Somebody had painted a sprig
of parsley and a horizontal "fill line" on it.  The idea is that you
put it in your refrigerator, add water up to the fill line, and keep
your fresh parsley in it so it will keep longer.
        Only $11.95.

Regarding the story about rose petal salad: sounds like the sales clerk at the
flower shop was inspired by "The Little Shop Of Horrors" (the movie...haven't
seen the play, so don't know if the line got carried over to the stage). All
of us "Little Shop" fans are wondering when it will make its next TV appearance.
It used to be a semi-regular feature on Channel 7, before 7 became SE7EN and
got "responsible." The price of progress I s'pose.

Why Wyeth may legitimately be included in a New England cohort:  He has for
most or all of his life spent his summers on the Maine coast.  Many of the
paintings reproduced everywhere were done in the old farmhouse in Maine.  The
stunning series of nudes of Siri are all summer pictures; the wispy curtain
and rough plaster walls hallmarks are from the Maine house.  Lots of these
hang in the Brandywine museum managed by his nephew-in-law, also a painter.

Another Wilmington eye-catcher is Pierre Samuel duPont's Longwood Gardens,
a three-acre set of conservatories for various climates including a large
and gorgeous central display that changes with the seasons (life-size
topiary animals, cascade mums) as well as a large Italian water garden and
a fountain display with colored lighting coordinated to pipe organ recitals.
Winterthur, incidentally, was Henry Francis duPont's home; until not long
ago its contents of centuries of American furniture occupied the east wing
of the Metropolitan Museum.  They're back now, but you must make reserva-
tions to tour there.  There is a smaller and more informal collection as
well that you can visit any time.  The big collection is really geared to
the serious antique student.  And the gardens are lovely - thousands of
azaleas and bulbs glorify April and May.

Can you spot another Delaware native?  (Went to junior high in Chadds Ford,
Wyeth's Pennsylvania home.)

Andrew maintains (or maintained) a home in Cushing, Maine, as well as
in Pennsylvania.  Much of his subject matter and his people are from that
area.  Christina was a neighbor.

He may have abandoned that home as the tourists discovered where it
was and he felt his privacy was severely invaded and his presence was
destroying the atmosphere of an otherwise quiet and relatively remote
coastal village. (Or at least I recall hearing something like that.)

There is a museum in Rockland, Maine that has a collection of moderate
size covering the Wyeth family.

&gt;       While you are in Wilmington visiting the museum, also go
&gt;to the Hagley and Winterthur museums.  Hagley is the original
&gt;site of the DuPont Corp.  It includes the family mansion, a working
&gt;powder mill, and some interesting history of the founding of Delaware.
&gt;Winterthur used to be a DuPont family mansion (I forget which one) and
&gt;now exibits antique furniture.

To say that Winterthur "exhibits antique furniture" is to miss the
bizarre-ness of the place.  Winterthur is a museum of historic and period
buildings.  That's right; buildings.

The actual museum building is a multistory empty shell.  The curators wander
around looking for interesting buidings that are about to be destroyed.
They acquire these buildings and move them (or rooms/sections of them) lock,
stock, walls, floors and ceilings, into the museum shell.  They then furnish
this acquisition with original, or appropriate-to-the-period furniture.
All of this is attached to the original DuPont mansion (one of them),
which is itself part of the museum.  [The shells are constructed as wings
on the original building.]

It takes an entire day to see the place.  They offer two half-day
non-intersecting tours.  You can't wander on your own (except in the gardens).

ON OXYMORONS:
In a drawer of a desk at the company for which I worked before DEC,
I came across a sheet of paper, obviously an nth-generation photostat,
about things called "baby puppies".  They're like oxymorons, only reverse.
That is, they are phrases that are inherently redundant,
rather than inherently contradictory.  "Baby puppy" is one example.
I've misplaced that wonderful sheet, but I'm sure you can think of some.
"Old nag" comes to mind.  Although I know they weren't on that list,
one major source of baby puppies is acronyms.  "SSN number" in the US
context, "PIN number" in the context of DCU banking cards.
I always regard "DTN number" as a baby puppy,
although purists will state categorically that the "N" stands for
"network" and doesn't and couldn't possibly stand for "number".

ON ROSES:
I once tried rose petals, and was unimpressed.
Perhaps one needs a large quantity to produce a detectable flavour.
On the other hand, there are some extremely common lawn weeds
that I've never been able to identify (sort of spearhead- or spade-
shaped, and they seem to prefer drier, sandy soil) that are quite tasty!
Just goes to show you can't judge by appearances.

                      Reincarnation
                      Wallace McRay

What is reincarnation? a cowboy asked his friend.
It starts, his old pal told him, when your life comes to its end.
They comb your hair and wash your neck and clean your fingernails,
and put you in a padded box away from life's travails.
Now the box and you goes in a hole that's been dug in the ground.
Reincarnation starts in when you're planted beneath that mound.
Them clods melts down just like the box and you who is inside,
and that's when you're beginning your transformation ride.
And in awhile the grass will grow upon your rendered mound
until some day upon that spot a lonely flower is found.
And then a horse may wonder by and graze upon that flower
that once was you and is now become your vegetative bower.
Now the flower that the horse done eat along with his other feed
makes bone and fat and muscle essential to the steed.
But there's a part that he can't use and so it passes through,
and there it lies upon the ground, this thing that once was you.
And if perchance I should pass by and see this on the ground,
I'll stop awhile and I'll ponder it, this object that I've found.
And I'll think about reincarnation, and life and death and such;
and I'll come away concluding, Why, you ain't changed all that much!

Associated Press

   BOSTON (AP) - Although Richard M. Nixon quit in 1974, when most
high seniors were just entering school, 72 percent of 539 Boston
area seniors identified him in a televison station quiz as the
president who resigned to avoid impeachment.
   WNEV-TV, Boston's channel 7, reported Thursday that 86 percent
of the seniors also correctly identified George Bush as the U.S.
vice president, often considered one of the country's most obscure
high post.
   More than 70 percent of the students were able to answer
correctly six of 10 political questions and two of 10 geographical
questions, the station reported.
   In the geography quiz, 71 percent of the students were unable to
identify all the six New England states, 62 percent were unable to
name three African countries, 58 percent were unable to identify
three South American countries but 81 percent knew the equator was
the imaginary line around the middle of the earth.
   A total of 56 percent of the students were unable to name the
last five U.S. presidents and 41 percent could not identify the
Bill of Rights.
   The television station said students questioned were from West
Roxbury and Boston Technical High in Boston and two unidentified
suburban high schools.
