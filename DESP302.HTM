Well, I just eliminated a bunch of non-working addresses from the
Desperado mailing list, most of them from DEC, the greatest removal of
unwanted digits since the notorious chop poker tournament in Macao in
1929.

Some of those folks had been on the list since 1978.  I will be doing
some searching of the net to find these lost lambs, but please tell
people who you think would be interested in hearing it that I am
stumbling back to life.

Send mail to majordomo@world.std.com with the contents

                         subscribe desperado

Sooner than you think, we return to full strength, or even better,
because the archives will be posted on the web after all those years
of promises.

Yr. bdy,
Tom Parmenter
