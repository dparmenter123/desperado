Question of the day:

What the hell is an "architect" anyway?  Software, I mean.  One Desperado,
who sleeps with a real (building) architect, tells me that to her way of
thinking our "architects" more closely resemble the people who do the fancy
artist's conception of how it will all look once someone else builds it and
that they have no resembalance to what real architects do, which is design
buildings, specify materials, schedules, resources, concepts, decorations,
bells, whistles, foundations, zoning approvals and other real work.

    From the Aberistwith local paper, date about 1937, recalled on BBC
    Radio 4 recently.

    The hostess of a dinner party had picked some wild mushrooms.  To
    ensure the safety of her guests she cooked some of the mushrooms
    and fed them to her dog.  The dog lived, so she served her guests.
    As the meal finished the maid rushed in to say that the dog was
    dead.

    A doctor was sent for, and all the guests had their stomachs pumped
    out.  The doctor then asked to see the dead dog, only to find that
    it had been run over by a car.

    tough."

    these chicks had been washed in Shampoorific with Glo-coat and the
    other had been washed in a conventional 'poo.  Now imagine letting the

I'm told I wasn't quite fair to Noam Chomsky in reporting his "no comment"

An ad in The New Republic offers $500.00 for a brief article telling
about an ethical dilemma you've faced in your career as a journalist.
It's from FineLine (tm), "The Newsletter On Journalism Ethics".  (I've
never heard of this newsletter before; but why would I have heard of
it, and it might just be starting up now.)  For information, call
1-800-736-0897 and ask for Robin Hughes, the Editor.

I thought perhaps this might pique your curiosity and you might have a
suitable anecdote for them, since I know that you're interested both
in journalism and Journalism, so to speak.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
$500!  Do I have to have resolved the ethical dilemma in a manner suitable
to post-Watergate, post-Monkey-Business, post-Jim-Wright morality?

For those who haven't gleaned my entire autobiography from passing random
remarks here and there over the past 49 years, I was a real live
(pre-everything) newspaper reporter in Chicago from 1962 through '67 and a
magazine writer for a few years after that.  I worked first for a local
wire service and then for a crime-oriented daily called Chicago's American.

I guess my ethical dilemma is that none of these things were ethical
dilemmas at the time I did them.  Newspaper reporting was a blue-collar job
in those days and we didn't go in for that white-collar stuff.

Simplest case:  Call up some place where some ghastly event has taken
place.  Say in a gruff voice:  "Can I speak to one of the officers?"  If
the cops were there, you talked to them.  If they weren't, you said in the
same gruff voice:  "What's going on there, then?"  I rarely claimed to be a
cop, but then I rarely had to.  People will tell you all kinds of stuff if
you ask them right.

I went into a flophouse where a derelict (having been found dead) had
lived, in my trench coat, with my repertorial mustache in place.  "Lemme
see your records." Terrified clerk turns them over to me.

(While I was out doing this derring-do, there was a murder right in the
police station I had just left.  I had arranged with the homicide cops to
check with them while I was out, but when I called them from the flophouse,
they wouldn't talk to me.  So I called the burglary cops next door, who
were laughing like crazy because the homicide cops had a homicide right in
their laps.  A witness to a murder, who was being questioned, had killed
the murderer, who was handcuffed to a desk.  The memorable headline was:
MOTHER OF 14 KILLS FATHER OF 12.  That's how many children they had, not
their ages.)

When I covered City Hall, I worked for the local wire service ("City
Press") and was the bottomest man in the press room.  My stuff went out on
the radio stations, but all the papers had their regular reporters there.
The only thing of mine that got into all the papers was the daily radiation
and air-pollution figures.  There were six regulars in all.

So, the deal at City Hall was that we were there to cover the day-to-day
activities of the city government, but we didn't do any investigative
reporting.  That way, the investigative reporter would get everybody mad at
him (very few hers in those days), while we beat reporters would continue
to have access to the all-important radiation count, and so forth.

Meaning, among other things, that come Christmas the beat reporters were
inundated with gifts, including cash.  As bottom man, I collected about
$800 in cash, forty bottles of liquor, a ham, a pair of binoculars, and a
pair of Florsheim shoes.  I still have the binoculars and the shoes,
twenty years later.  I took most of the liquor into my office and gave it
to the rewrite men, telephone operator, office manager, etc., but I kept
the money and ate the ham that Mayor Daley gave me.  Mayor Daley also gave
me a fifth of 25-year-old Scotch, whereupon I discovered that all my
friends were Scotch drinkers.

There was precisely nothing I could have done to prevent this rain of
goodies from falling on my head.  If I was getting that much, I imagine the
guy from the Chicago Tribune was doing ten to twenty times better.  The
fact that I was getting $50 a week had something to do with my attitude.
So did the fact that there was also precisely nothing I could do to corrupt
the news I was sending out.  And, nobody ever asked me to be corrupt
anyway.

I got $100 in the form of two $50s from a guy I had never even seen and
whose office wasn't even on my beat.  These two $50 were crisp, new, in
numerical sequence, *and* twenty years old.  Presumably, this chap (one of
the infamous Cullertons, for any Chicago readers) had box after box of
cash. By mutual agreement, we all turned down one young alderman who
offered us $5 apiece.  "We only take from the crooks," I believe we told
him.

One other Christmas, I was covering Criminal Courts.  I was somewhat higher
on the totem pole there.  I was working for the American by then, having
just replaced a real sleazebag oldtimer on that beat.  I had family
obligations that Christmas and I had to go away, so the sleazebag came back
and just stood at the intersection of the two main halls with his hand out.
There were by then a few opportunities for me to be corrupt, so it's just
as well I was called home that Christmas.

As an overnight rewrite man, I worked for an old bastard named Harry
Romanoff whose one goal in life was filling the paper up each night.  He
was an old-time Hearst reporter, a legendary one, and he'd had a million
scoops and was ready for a million more, however he got them.

One citizen was having a war with the Sanitary District (sewers and
political corruption, their specialties) because their lagoons (lovely
word) were heading toward his yard every time it rained.  He had barricaded
his yard with sandbags and we sent a photographer down to shoot the flood.
When he got there, there was no flood, so he shot the dry yard with
sandbags and came back.  Our artist cut out the dry yard and replaced it
with a picture of Lake Michigan in a storm that looked just dandy when we
printed it in the paper.

We were an afternoon paper, depndent on street sales, and we had to have an
eight-column headline whether there was an eight-column story or not.  We
worked all night to get that headline.  The bottom of the barrel was
GE OPENS RUMANIA PLANT DESPITE PROTESTS.  The Young Americans for Freedom,
a bunch of conservative dips, had made this protest.  Fortunately, there
was a trunk murder later in the day and the entire story disappeared.

Another time when we were starving for news, we cooked up a story on the
mathematical non-elimination of the White Sox from the pennant race.  They
really didn't have a chance.  The sports desk (Brent Musberger, as a matter
of fact) wouldn't have anything to do with this ridiculous stunt, so I
wrote it:  GO-GO SOX WON'T QUIT.  Eight tortured paragraphs proving
something nobody believes, written by me, whose baseball fandom was so
dormant at that time that despite living two blocks from Wrigley Field (day
games only) and working at night, I had never been to a Cubs game.

The Illinois river was running high on Sunday night when there was damn
little news shaking.  Sundays were the worst.  So Romy called up various
fire departments downstate, claiming to be "Captain Parmenter from the
governor's office", to see what they were doing about the flood.
"Nothing," they said, "There is no flood.  It's just springtime."

That was all Romy had to hear.  "Man, your town is in danger!  Ring those
church bells!  Get those people out there filling up sandbags!  Do your
duty, man!"  Then he came back to my desk and dictated the story to me:
"Church bells rang out over southern Illinois as citizens gathered to
protect their homes against the raging Illinois river."  Et cetera, et
cetera, and so forth.

We did that kind of thing all the time.  We had a paper to get out and you
need news to do it.  No news?  Make some!  I didn't lose any sleep over it.
It was a great life (when you're 22).  I eventually got sick of calling
people at 3 am.  It happened all at once.  Romy was mad at me because I
had questioned him on some of his so-called facts, so he made me call a
woman whose son had died in a motorcycle crash.  We never did that with
routine deaths and he knew I hated it, so he made me do it.  I talked to
the guy's mother.  "I'm sorry to be disturbing you at a time like this," I
said politely.  "It's all right.  I wasn't asleep,"  she said quietly.  I
can hear it now.

I'm glad I did it all, unethical or not, and I'm glad I don't do it
anymore.

        --r

------------------------------------------------------------
        here is a rough description; it may help clarify things
--------------------------------------------------------------

Beautiful Abundance
        the machines are asleep, surrounded by cornucopias,
lit torches, and hanging strings of fish and gilt pinatas,
all in a freeway underpass, in which there are bleachers,
sofas, and comfy armchairs for the audience.  there is a stack
of pianos piled four high, and one suspended from the ceiling.
there is a black tent at the far end.  (the arches of the underpass,
the immense scale of everything, and the cornucopias and gilt props
all seemed very baroque.)
        the giant arm wakes up, and noses around the suspended
cornucopias.  the giant magnet appears from behind a painted curtain,
as does the chipper.  the chipper buzzes around, feeding itself with
the pinatas, but not spraying anythng out.  something pokes out from
the tent, shoots a jet of flame, and then stomps out, toppling the
tent -- it is a giant 4-legged walking machine.  the inchworm,
which is something of a brat, waves its arm-and-drill at the
audience and the shockwave cannon.  the scrabbler starts dancing
on its metal-plated disco floor.
        the arm decides to play the pianos (17 stacked four high around
a pillar, and another one suspended from the ceiling.)  it moves over
that way, and when it gets there re-stacks some of the pianos.  (the
big arm is Very Big, and tried to kill its creator, its software engineer,
and itself during the week before the show.)  the inchworm, which has been
menacing the audience (after provoking the shockwave cannon into firing),
moves that way too.  suddenly, the Big Blower flames on and starts to cook
several boxes of food.  the magnet plays with the giant clacker balls, and
then lifts a counterweight to feed the chipper by tipping a cornucopia.
the magnet then (accidentally?  i think not) topples over a large
glass-fronted refirgerator, spilling out fish and pig heads.  the inchworm
pokes at the giant arm, which tries to ignore it.  the big blower starts
winching itself towards the ceiling.

Mayhem With The Toys
        the arm, disgusted by the inchworm, moves back to the
cornucopias.  the inchworm goes back to menacing the crowd.
(at this point, the magnet pops a hydraulic line, and is so out of
commision, but not before it has seriously disturbed the clacker balls.)
the walker nears the pianos, and fires its flamethrower; the pianos
take a while to catch.  (the walker's microprcessor reset every time
the flamethrower went on, so we couldn't walk and flame simultaneously.
fortunately, we wrote the code so that a reset just put the code
back into 'wait for a radio signal'  mode.  good thing too.)
the inchworm arrives at the pianos again -- it is much the fastest
of the untethered machines -- and makes rude gestures at the
walker, which is pointed the wrong way to do anything about it,
and can't turn (or move) around very fast.  the big blower shoots out a jet
of flame at the two, but it is just out of range, but every time
it fires, the walker flames the pianos again.
        back at the cornucopias, the arm is looking at the scrabbler
(which is something like a hyperactive rabid dog, given added
bounce by an elastic cord to the ceiling.)  it notices the chipper,
which suddenly turns its chopper on and shoots shredded vegetable,
fish, and pinatas at the audience.  the scrabbler dies (not
intentionally; we discovered later that several of its relays got
shorted out by damp shredded vegetables.)
        the chipper moves to the suspended cornucopia, and
waits expectantly, but the magnet is gone.  who will help?
the inchworm zips over and starts boring holes in the cornucopia,
beneath which the chipper positions itself.  the cornucopia
is pretty well trashed, but still in mid-air, and the chipper
is happy.  (this is the only socially responsible thing the
inchworm does all evening.)
        the walker, seizing a golden opportunity, flames the
rear end of the inchworm, whose sound system starts to burn.
the arm investigates the dead magnet, and plays with the clacker
balls, trying to ignore everynbody else's bad behaviour.
        the shockwave cannon, which has been doing rude things to
the audience (you can feel the concussion a long way away)
starts to melt (damn cooling system failed again, just like
it did when it was being tested, but instead of stopping to
fix it, the crew keeps firing it -- right thing to do, since
the meltdown is pretty spectacular.)  the big blower
develops a leak, showering part of the audience in diesel fuel.
it decides it isn't much longer for the world, and erupts with
a 15 second, 60 foot long jet of flame, causing steam to
rise from metal boxes of food, which are covered with blow-ups
of 1950's advertising pictures.)

Mutual Destruction
        the walker moves away from the pianos, and attacks the
inchworm again.  the inchworm retreats back to its favorite
hobby -- being obnoxious -- and tries to wave burning bits
of wood (stuck on its drill) at the audience.  the big arm finds
several bags behind the curtain, and drops them in front of the
audience.  they burst open, spilling out several hundered
half-pound sticks of dynamite (carefully filled with plaster,
rather than explosive, but the audience didn't know that,
and reacted in a most gratifying manner.)  a bucket
somehow gets jostled and starts bubbling over with a frothy
white foam, which continues for the next 20 minutes.  (sandia
national lab developed a substance that, when its components
are mixed, expands to 600 times its original volume.  i don't
know where we got it from.)
        the big arm is getting tired of this mess.  it goes
to teach the walker and inchworm a lesson they won't forget.
the walker flames it thoroughly, but it survives (mil-spec
computer enclosure and teflon coated wires), although the cornucopia
and chipper behind it don't.  (at this point, the walker's battery
died -- i ran out to see why the fool thing had stopped moving, and
saw that the solenoids were being sluggish, which means the
battery is too low.)  the walker continues spurting flame
at the big arm as it goes by.
        the arm pulls itself (i don't know how else to describe
its motion) over to the pianos.  it tries to grab the inchworm, which
darts out of the way and goes to sulk near the remains of the
shockwave cannon.  the arm then goes back to playing the pianos.
the pianos are, alas, less stable when on fire, and the arm can't
keep them stacked.  while trying to do so, it extends its arm
and twists its collar in a way that is known to be unstable, and
topples over into the pyre.

        (the last couple paragraphs above are where we started straying
from the script.)
        so.  it was pretty intense.  the crowd seemed to like it, too.
amazingly enough, we followed the script for about three quarters of
the show (with minor variations because of disabled machines.)
toppling the arm was an inspired move, thought up while it was
following the inchworm.  the arm will need a pretty thorough
overhaul -- lying in a stack of burning pianos, even for
only a few minutes, is much more difficult to survive than
being spit at by a diesel-powered flame thrower.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

and now some answers:

&gt;   So, Raymond, was the backhoe/dinosaur *supposed* to fall over or what?
yes.  it was planned about five minutes before it actually happened.

&gt;   And what, if anything, was the clacker/sled machine supposed to be doing?
the magnet and arm were supposed to fight over them, with the winner
dragging them closer to the audience or giving them to the scrabbler.

&gt;   I-80 question
they shut it down for a few minutes because of the smoke.

&gt;   (how does he get permits for these shows? (does he have insurance?)).
there is insurance.  the permit stuff is a deep dark mystery to
everybody but pauline and his majordomo.

&gt;   who coordinates whom?
pauline is in radio contact with the machine operators.  each machine
has an operator with a heqadset, and the bigger ones sometimes
have an assistant (to look around, run out and fix things, etc.)
the big flame thrower had a large crew to move it around.
the video crew is similarly organized by jon reiss, and warned not
to get in the way.
    there is an initial script, which is refined over a couple of weeks,
internalized by the operators, and modified on the fly during the
show, by mark pauline, or by the operators after checking with
him.  in a well-run show, the machines develop a will of their
own, and the right things just happen.  last weekend's was pretty
good that way.

&gt; Looked like a major oops there at the end (the meltdown of one of the star
&gt; machines).  The severity of the piano inferno also seemed to surprise most
&gt; everybody involved.

the arm was meant to tip over; the operator had doubts, but pauline was
insistent.  (the arm had been causing trouble all week before the
show, attacking various people and severing its own control lines,
so suicide seems a just end.)  the pianos were a bit more enthusiastic
than we'd expected.

&gt; Things to note:
&gt;
&gt; The torches were simply plexiglas rods (optionally stuck into sheep or cow
&gt; heads).  They burned very well; I wonder how bad the fumes were.

the torches are made of the same stuff as fiber optic cables.  they burn
well, but won't light with anything less hot than an oxyacetylene torch.

&gt; This stuff has become very popular.  I'd guess that crowd at 8,000-10,000
&gt; (has anybody seen official figures?).  Where, other than the internet and
&gt; the SoMa posters, did any advertising appear?

most of haight street, north beach, and SoMa were postered, as were
a couple unsuspecting vehicles (or so it was reported to us.)  the
SF Art Institute tends to send a large contingent to the show.
there were 3000 tickets sold (plus a couplke hundred given away),
and an estimated audience of 1500-2000 on nearby buildings.

here is a report by Mark Shepherd, also associated with the software
side of things.

Survival Research Laboratories held its Memorial Day barbeque
in San Francisco on the evening of May 28. The performance, entitled
"Illusions of Shameless Abundance - degenerating into an uninterrupted
sequence of hostile encounters", was held in a parking lot under
a freeway. The large concrete pillars supporting the freeway were
decorated with torches, animal heads, gilded carousel figures, and
silvered mylar, which together with the pre-show soundtrack of
Sousa marches mixed with live cellular radio telephone created an atmosphere
somewhere between a medieval dungeon and a 3-ring circus. The overflow
crowd surrounded the performance area on all sides. The set included
a stack of 15 or so pianos piled up around one of the pillars,
two large cornucopias filled with rotting vegetables suspended from the
ceiling, a refrigerator display case filled with all kinds of goodies,
and a birds nest built from 2x4s and fish fillets, at the top of one
of the pillars.

This was one of the biggest and most sophisticated shows ever.
The machines included:
- the big arm: a cross between a dinosaur and a backhoe. It has large
  jaws and walks around by dragging itself.
- the inchworm: a kind of hydraulic caterpillar, with a 12-foot long
  articulated nose/finger tipped with a rotating drill
- the 6-barrel shock wave cannon: complete with a tilt-pan control
  system allowing it to be aimed at any member of the audience
- the chipper: handy for shredding wood, vegetables, or anything else
  you can get into its 3-foot wide mouth. The results are ejected at
  high speed from the spout at the other end.
- the walking machine: 2 tons, 4 legs, and a flamethrower. Slow,
  but effective.
- the magnet, the clacker balls, the shock box, the large flamethrower,
  the scrabbler round out the cast.

The show lasted for about an hour. All the machines joined in the party,
and a good time was had by all. Some of the highlights:
- the piano mountain, started on fire by the walking machine, blazes
  out of control. The crew attempts in vain to reduce the fire. The
  freeway is closed because of smoke and flying embers. The sound
  and control booth is temporarily shut down as burnt cables start
  to short out.
- the shock wave cannon performs flawlessly, harassing the audience
  with 60 MPH air bursts for almost the entire performance.
  As its cooling system fails, the 6 barrels begin to melt, one by one.
- the large flamethrower springs a leak and starts dumping diesel
  fuel all over the ground. The audience, having seen Hitchcock's
  "The Birds", immediately extinguishes all cigarettes.
- the inchworm and the arm vie for MVP award, each managing to
  commit major acts of mayhem and intimidation. The inchworm's
  drill bit proves useful for dissecting a cornucopia. The arm's
  finest moment comes when, after waving a burning piano in the air,
  it topples over into the flaming piano mountain ending the show.

The big disappointment of the evening was the shock box. Hours before
the show, it was discovered that everytime it discharged its 35 kilovolt
capacitors into an innocent object, the resulting magnetic pulse
disabled the generator for the light and sound system. Regretably it
had to be benched for the whole show.

For the techies: besides the usual inspired assortment of hydraulic
and electrical goodies, this performance was assisted by 3 embedded computer
controllers: one for the walking machine, one for the arm, and one
for the scrabbler. Thanks to NASA, Archimedes, Hewlett-Packard, Dallas
Semiconductor, and Motorola for lending or donating equipment and
software. Some of them even knew what it was going to be used for.
Another first for SRL: the machine operators and video crew were directed
in real time over 2-way radio, making possible much more coordinated
choreography than ever before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
here is the original script
---------------------------------------------------------------

                        S C E N A R I O

ACT 1 - BEAUTIFUL ABUNDANCE

Big Arm waving its hand beneath the south Cornucopia in wonder. It knocks
some goodies out of it and sniffs at them. It then starts to move towards
the piano mountain.

Walking Machine burns through its plastic curtain and lumbers out towards
the middle doing its own kind of boogie, then starts lumbering towards
the pianos.

Magnet comes out from Curtain. Heads towards north cornucopia.

Chipper follows Magnet from behind curtain and heads toward cornucopias,
buzzing around under them, expectantly.

Magnet lifts plate counterweighting north cornucopia, causing the
contents to tip into the Chipper buzzing below.

Inchworm comes from east end pointing its finger in beautiful wand-like
motions. It taps the Shock Wave Cannon and the Cannon then begins firing.
Inchworm then heads to Piano Mountain, maybe messing with audience 1st.

The Scrabbler awakens, and begins to dance on its disco floor.

Clacker balls start to clack sporadically.

All major moving machines are playing their cellular phone loops.

ACT 2 - MAYHEM WITH THE TOYS

Big Arm begins playing the pianos.

Inchworm starts getting into the piano action. Not liking this, the
Big Arm trys to shove the Inchworm out of the way. The Inchwork shoves
back.

The Inchworm starts knocking into pictures on the beams.

Walking Machine nears and starts burning the piano mountain.

Inchworm then starts to point and mess with the audience.

Shock Box begins to bump into metal boxes, blasting at will,
like a stinging bee.

Chipper starts bumping into wood structures, feeding itself as goodies
fall into the hopper from these wood platforms.

Magnet begins picking up and dropping steel boxes causing foam
chemical reactions.

As Shock Wave Cannon begins to fire with greater frequency, large
Flame Blower begins to make short bursts of fire.

Arm grabs bag of fake TNTs and dumps into Audience 5.

Flame Blower is being winched into the air.

The Big Arm returns to the cornucopia and begins to feed heartily,
ripping the shoth cornucopia from the sky and stuffing what it can't
eat into the chipper.

ACT 3 - MUTUAL DESTRUCTION

The Magnet, having made its offerings to the Scrabbler, now picks the
Scrabbler up and drops it repeatedly. Shock Box joins the party on the
disco floor and wastes the Scrabbler.

Walking Machine has finished burning the pianos and shuffling around starts
to burn north cornucopia, barbecuing the fish, which the Big Arm
then tips into the Chipper.

Large fish are released on their cables into the Chipper. The Shock
Box arrives and drives its probes into the radiator of the Chipper
causing a loud report.

Big Arm grabs the Clacker Balls and yanks them into the
center area for the Magnet to pick up and drop at will.

Tired of harassing the audience, the Inchworm points its finger at
the Walking Machine a la Don Quixote at the windmill, the old lance
and dragon scenario. Shock Box interrupts this scene, coming up to to
the Walking Machines chicken wire wrapped legs and giving them a little
sheep dog nip on the heels.

Big Arm grabs Cable and starts swinging the Flame Blower causing
flames to lick the celing.

Magnet tips liquid Nitrogen over, fogging in Audience 4.

When all machines are thoroughly absorbed in acts of destruction,
ceiling charges are set off, scattering ashes to the wind.

I gotta call from our own Miz Smith yesterday afternoon; she had heard
a rumor that SRL would be putting on a small performance at 7pm in the
Bell Northern Research parking lot (Middlefield Road at the 237
Freeway near 101).  Hmmm, mighty mysterious.  If somebody was out to
get me, this would be a fine way to lead me to a lynch mob.

There was no publicity, so there were only about 50 people there and
roughly a dozen SRL folks.  I didn't see Mark "Lefty" Pauline there.
There were two camcorders recording the event.

I doubt that they got any sort of official permission to do this.

There was a wooden frame about the size of a garage door, with ten
telephones hanging from it.  In front of the frame was an old color TV
set and an old terminal (Visual 200) on top of a couple cable spools.
Decorative magnetic tape was wrapped around the whole thing and
assorted fireworks were placed all around the display.  A dozen fire
extinguishers were on the ready.

"Do you have some rope?  We'll turn it into an object d'art."
  -- one of the SRL team

A blue Mazda truck moved into position with a flamethrower in its cab.
This flamethrower had a large tank of fuel, an old Onan (Minneapolis,
Minn.) engine driving a three foot diameter centrifugal blower with
three spark gaps on the end powered by three ignition coils.  The
contraption hung out about four feet beyond the back of the truck.  It
looked mighty impressive.

"Who's got the script?" -- one of the SRL team

They huddled, and got to work.  They cranked up the flamethrower and
fried the display for a while, charring the phones, tv, and terminal.
Some of the fireworks went off.  Then they turned off the
flamethrower, picked up slegehammers, and started hitting the bells on
the phones and smashed the CRTs and tipped over the wooden frame.
Finally they cranked up the flamethrower for a real barbeque.  More
fireworks went off.  The audience clapped politely.  Very impressive.

Gosh, it's great to live near these guys.

The SRL team sound like the kind of guys who interpret "d'art" to mean
"something flying through the air, aimed directly at you, with a
sharpened metal point at the front."  I guess they know what they like.

                            FLAGGING ENTHUSIASM

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    I didn't fly the flag this Fourth of July.  I don't always fly the flag,
    but I have a flag and I do put it out from time to time.  I've even
    been thinking of getting a pole.

    I've known correct flag behavior as long as I can remember and I don't
    believe I've ever let the flag touch the ground in my life.  I know how
    to hang it from the side of a building (blue field to viewer's left)
    and I know how to fly it at half-staff (run it up to the top and bring
    it back down to halfway).  I was camping when the Marines were killed
    in Lebanon and we flew it half-staff for them.

    When I see a flag being burnt by some spiteful domestic rebel or raging
    foreigner, it makes my stomach turn.

    But I didn't fly the flag because of freedom of speech.  It's my
    favorite freedom, by far.  I thought about flying the flag, but also
    putting up a sign saying "Hands off the First Amendment".  I thought
    about flying it upside down as a symbol of distress.  I wish I'd had a
    "Don't Tread On Me" flag, then I could have put that one up.  In the
    end, I didn't fly anything because it was too depressing to deal with.

    Symbolic speech:  My favorite example is dumping that damn tea in the
    harbor.  Either that, or naked dancing, which has also been protected
    by the Supreme Court as freedom of speech, symbolic division. Jefferson
    Franklin and Washington would have liked that one, by all accounts.

    Also in the symbolic speech department, some WWII veterans north of
    Boston hung five members of the Supreme Court in effigy to express
    their disapproval of the flag-burning decision.  I hope some legal
    scholar or left-wing hippie pointed out to the vets that
    hanging-in-effigy cases are just the sort of thing that would be much
    more likely to get you in trouble if there were an anti-flag-burning
    amendment to the Constitution.

    In Hungary the other day, they reburied Imre Nagy, the ex-premier who
    led that nation in a thaw that failed in 1959.  He'd been buried in
    secret up to now, but glasnost said he could be buried in public and
    the ceremonies were quite moving.  At the funeral flew Hungarian flags
    with the centers torn out.  This was the symbol of Nagy's freedom
    movement, because the old Hungarian flag had had a communist symbol
    superimposed on it, and with that symbol torn out, they created a new
    symbol, using highly valuable symbolic speech.

    I'm even willing to protect that scumbag artist in Chicago who set up
    his art (so-called, worth about as much as a crucifix in a jar of piss
    in my opinion) such that you had to step on a flag to see the thing.
    I'd protect him, but I'd never step on a flag to look at it.

    All these people, me, vets, artistic-type artists, Abbie Hoffman and
    his shirt, and even the flag-burners (domestic and foreign), are
    showing their belief in the power of the symbol of the flag.  The only
    way the flag can keep that symbolic power is by living under the first
    amendment along with the naked dancers, tea-dumpers, and radicals, and
    sidewalk orators.

    The one patriotic gesture I managed to make on the Fourth of July was
    to place a bet that the anti-flag-burning amendment would not pass. The
    deadline was the Fourth of July, 1992.  I sure hope it doesn't pass
    because if it does, I can only think of one way to protest it.  If I
    have to pay off the bet, then there's one more thing I'll have to do.
    And the thought turns my stomach.

from:   SPACE Magazine V0 #119

[The following item is from Spaceflight, May issue.]

Tass reports that Soviet bureaucrats are trying to prosecute Sergei
Krikalev for draft-dodging, given that he failed to report for army-
reserve duty several months ago.  Krikalev has been unable to report as
requested because he has been in orbit aboard Mir.  The Tass headline
was "Space is no escape from dim-wit bureaucrats, cosmonaut learns."

Subj:   Something for Desperado

A female engineer started here, and was all set to organize a lunch to meet
and talk to the other women who work here.  She sent some mail to the "women"
mailing list, and then realized there were men on the mailing list.  This is
the dialogue:

New Female Engineer:
    So I found out a couple days ago that there are actually MEN on the
    women mailing list. Hmmmmm........ Should we let them come to lunch?

Male mailing list recipient:
    My credentials for being on this list are impeccable:

    1.  I've been married to two women (not at the same time, of course).

    2.  I currently share living space with two women related to me by blood
    or marriage.

    3.  At least one of our pets is a woman (rodent auxiliary).

    4.  Many years ago, as part of a top-secret government experiment, I
    actually lived inside a woman for nine months!  (This woman, known to me
    only as "Mom", is currently living in retirement on a government pension in
    Florida.)

New Female Engineer:
    It seems to me that any men could be on this mailing list then.

Male mailing list recipient:
    Easy for you to say.  I've *worked* for every one of those credentials.
    You want to know what I ate for those nine months?  You wouldn't feed it
    to your dog.

    There's even more:

    5.  I have appeared on stage professionally in a pink dress.  (And I
    still fit in it -- a size eight -- even after having fathered two
    children.)

Other female mailing list recipient:
    I guess we will let you come to lunch, if you wear the pink dress :-).

The gentleman in the pink dress, we're proud to note, was our own JO, the
original Desperado.

    The US Vice-President, Mr Quayle, told a Young Republicans conference
    that the country would soon be observing the 20th anniversary of
    "Neil Armstrong and Buzz Lukens's walk on the moon."  Buzz Lukens

Thought I'd like to hear some live rock 'n' roll music, so I checked
the concert listings:
        The Rolling Stones
        The Who
        Bob Dylan
        The Grateful Dead
        The Beach Boys

Thank God the last twenty years were only a dream!

I've followed the funny road for all my life, laughing at 'em as I see 'em,
and I have *never* heard the joke for which "No soap, radio" is the punch
line, nor have I ever heard the "Slowly I turned, step by step . . . "
joke.  I *do* know the one about "If I could walk that way, I wouldn't need
the talcum powder.
