Making VMS squirm (oops, that should be 'scroll'...) is cute.  But it makes
things a bit tough for anyone who might want to use the REPLY command that
VMS so kindly provides.  One can't REPLY while the squirm is in progress,
and trains of thought tend to get lost before the squirm ends.  I shall con-
tinue to live with the clumsiness of paging ('screening'?) through my Desper-

2)  The world is ready for a new musical genre: High-Tech Country-Western.
    The first hit will be "I'm Just a Badblock on the Winchester of Life."
    Should sell a million.

3)  Have you ever considered republishing collections of Desperado dialog
    on common themes of interest? Much like Scientific American books...
    I've been thinking of names for the imprint.

    How about

        Old Flames from Desperado
    or
        Desperado Dialogues

     Good candidates for collecting would be the Real Millrats series,
     Desperadi on "the whole 9 yards," and various grammar flames.

   You should know that I think of you as a small publisher, putting out a
   modern-day "little magazine." This perception raises terminology ques-

   (Desperado certainly is one.)

Subject: Jon Parsons' query (Desperado #1038)

Jon Parsons wondered why people will use "as if it were going
out of style" to refer to something's popularity, whereas logic
seems to call for the opposite interpretation. The usage may
simply indicate user carelessness and ignorance, but there's
another possibility that occurs to me:

Whenever the great mass of people becomes enthusiastic about
something (an investment scheme, fashion, fad, etc.), that's
an almost sure sign that the thing is on the decline or is about
to begin its decline. Thus, for instance, if "they're buying widgits
like they are going out of style," then the odds are that,
unbeknownst to the naive panic-buyers, the popular fascination
with widgits is about to end.

Can we assemble a mob of angry villagers to storm the Globe's office and
demand that "Conrad" be removed forcibly from the comics page?  As I'm
constitutionally incapable of skipping over any strip, I have to read
this sexist, unfunny, offensive drivel daily.  "Conrad" makes me yearn
for the restoration of even something like "Tumbleweeds" or "Kudzu."

On the plus side, I have to commend NBC's show "Cheers" as the hands-down
best sitcom I've ever seen on television.  (Everyone will have his or her
own favorite, I'm sure, but I don't want to hear about it.)  The writing
and direction are simply outstanding in every sense;  this show has more
terrific throw-away lines than most shows have big punchlines.  If you
haven't caught "Cheers" this year, you've missed one fine program.

--J.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I wrote him back that I hated Conrad because not only was it
unredeemedly stupid and insulting, but also poorly drawn, in that all
the panels look alike.  I added that I still missed Mutt &amp; Jeff,
which, while dumb, was *not*stupid* and was *not*poorly*drawn*, and
which I miss much more than I miss Doonesbury.  I added that I really
liked the way the Herald was treating comics these days.  They've
added three new ones, including a whimsical surrealist gem about a
talking chimp drawn by Ken Overgard, who also draws Mike Nomad and
Steve Roper in the Other Paper.  The Herald is printing their strips
about half again as large as they used to which really makes Peanuts
look great.  With the bigger strips, the Herald funnies are now
spread out over four (tabloid) pages, making reading them very
pleasant as you find little nuggets of comics all over the paper.  I
also asked him if he thought Cheers was as good as Barney Miller.

From: CLOSUS::OSTROWSKY
To:   KERMIT::T_PARMENTER

Yes, bring back Mutt &amp; Jeff -- if we must have a poorly drawn, dumb strip,
it might as well be the granddaddy of them all (not to be confused with the
Rose Bowl).  I realize M&amp;J is your favorite, but I've never been able to
understand the fatal attraction, myself.

Overgard hasn't lacked for practice doing a talking chimp.  Mike Nomad, I
love ya, ya chooch.

I don't know what gives with Steve.  Some people get real nasty when they're
tight.  Steve would be better off giving a technicolor yawn and getting on
with it.  Maybe he could take up with Ma Jong.  I confess to an unhealthy
fascination with the inscrutable restauranteuse -- what, one wonders, would
she be like out of the grimy apron and in something lacy?

It would be nice to put together a newspaper that would combine the best
elements of different dailies -- the Herald's comics (four pages -- wow!),
the Globe's sports pages, and so on.

I love Barney Miller, and I adored the old (good) Bob Newhart Show, but
I prefer Cheers.  You might not, of course, but I think at the very least
you'll enjoy it.  I replay a week's episode for days and days in my head.

Subject: the U.S. answer to Japan?

The March 24, 1983 issue of Electronics has an article about the formation
of something called the Microelectronics &amp; Computer Technology Corp.,
headed by Bobby R. Inman.  The MCC was formed to give U. S. companies a
means of sharing research and development costs without running afoul of
antitrust regulations.  It has an operating budget of $50 to $85 million
yearly, and will do R&amp;D that its sponsors will then try to turn into
products.

The initial shareholders in the new corporation are:  DEC, Mostek, RCA,
Sperry, Harris, NCR, Motorola, Control Data, Honeywell, National
Semiconductor, and Advanced Micro Devices.

One of the projects mentioned in the article is one that will last ten
years with a team of 80 to 90 engineers and scientists.  It consists of a
computer architecture effort that MCC calls Alpha/Omega.  Its goal is the
development and transfer of selective technologies for future generations
of  computers and smart peripherals.  It has four parts:

        * an artificial-intelligence effort to establish the theoritical
          groundwork for prototype AI architectures and to deliver a
          prototype system capable of 100,000 "inferences" a second.

        * a prototype database machine architecture with a tenfold
          performance improvement over present processing architectures

        * a new user interface incorporating a prototype speech- and image
          recognition system

        * one or more parallel processing architectures.

According to the article, the MCC is widely assumed to be the U. S.
response to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
responsible for much of that country's operative research in computers.

     The doubts CACHE::BUCH expresses about the concrete meaning of 'the whole
nine yards' leave ME unconvinced.  As he says &lt;&lt;roughly&gt;&gt;: 'the mixer of
a concrete truck [was] big . . . [even back when I was] eight years old.'
After all, a sphere with 9 cubic yards volume has a radius of only 1.29 yards,
or 7'8'' diameter.  As the mixer on a cement truck is elongated from
sphericity, its maximum diameter would be even smaller.  As a casual admirer
of cement trucks (without benefit of technical specifications) for upwards
of three decades, I am doubtful that creatures of this size are such a
recent innovation.  Also, we are reliably informed that the smallest
truck in current general use is 8 cubic yards.  I find it hard to swallow
the SMALLEST now to be seen exceeds the capacity of the LARGEST to be
found a mere 15 years ago.  I suggest invocation of those hard paternal data.

     As to GALAXY::PARSONS's concern about garbled similes, 'selling X
like it was going out of style' would indeed make no sense.  The
correct idiom is: 'They [or he, she] were SPENDING MONEY like it was
going out of style.'  The sense is clear.  Curious how it got turned
inside out while being passed along.

The Great Salt Lake in Utah (as with many large lakes) goes through
long term fluctuations in depth that significantly affect its size.
Although currently smaller than it was in the 19th Century, the Lake
is currently in an expansion phase that has lasted over a decade.

In recent years this current expansion began seriously to threaten
buildings, factories, roads, and other facilities built near the
now approaching shoreline.  Four years ago, the Utah legislature passed
a bill making it illegal for the Lake to exceed a height of 4202 feet
above mean sea level.  As of February, 1983, the Lake inched above
the proscribed level, making it the nation's largest known outlaw.

The State has not yet tried to prosecute the Lake, and it is not clear
what form of punishment would fit the crime.  Life imprisonment seems
ambiguous at best.  Banishment to forced labor in the salt mines
seems impractical.  Perhaps they will simply have to resort to a
modified form of Chinese Water Torture.

Subject: Hey, Newton, we've got your music!

Albert Brooks once claimed that a survey showed that people consider
disk jockeys the third most despised group of individuals in the world,
right after (1) Incurable lepers and (2) curable lepers.

Anyway, I heard a couple of cuts off an album I think you might enjoy.
The band is called Blotto, and they hail from the heart of the Capital
District, Albany, NY.  What I heard might be characterized as garage-band,
60s-based rock -- nothing innovative or terrifically well played, but
amusing, listenable stuff.  One song, "It's Not You," shreds the facade
of teenaged suburban romance.  The other tune I heard, "Goodbye, Mr. Bond,"
is a very funny pastiche that features John Barry (?) soundtrack-like riffs
backing up one of the band members uttering every evil cliche that every
villain ever threatened Bond with.  I found it utterly captivating, although
I suppose one could be bored by it after a while.

Speaking of 007, you undoubtedly know that the true Bond, Sean Connery,
is returning to a screen near you this summer to recreate his greatest role.
The film is entitled "Never Say Never Again," and I will be in line at
the theatre at least eight hours before the first show starts.  There is
only one Bond, of course;  replacing Connery with the awesomely untalented
Roger Moore was equivalent to replacing Ethel Merman with Olivia Newton-John.
We wait expectantly, Messrs. Saltzman and Broccoli, for Connery to utter once
again the trademark line, "Bond.  James Bond."
