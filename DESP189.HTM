Subj:   How Not to Burn a Flag

I think I've figured out a good way to protest flag-burning laws
 without burning a flag (and getting that sinking feeling).  In
  fact, I think it'll be more effective than burning a flag.

Here's the scenario:  Pols have just passed a law of dubious
 constitutionality, outlawing flag desecration.  The amendment
  to the Bill of Rights is still, er, on the back burner.

Protestors nationwide find a new cherished national symbol to
 burn:  replicas of the Statue of Liberty or the Liberty Bell,
  Smokey the Bear, or (my personal favorite) the Bill of Rights.
   Then they call their legislators and demand constitutional
    amendments to stop the appropriate atrocity.

Alternatively, hire Jay Leno to do some public service spots:
 "We've only got one Bill of Rights.  Hundreds of flags are made
  every day.  So, burn all you want . . ." *Foof!* ". . . we'll
   make more!"
    &lt;_Jym_&gt;

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The first time I ever had a press pass, I got to be right down front at an
event where I would have been better off way back in the audience.  It was
a fireworks display where they had a bunch of set pieces that burned on the
ground.  Among the displays was Niagara Falls, the Capitol, and (ta-da) Old
Glory.  So, did that amount to burning a flag?

Subj:   Re: Fashion Gestapo strikes again

It's no secret that most women's bathing suit fashions are designed for
 0.00007% of the female population.  The rest, whose bodies don't con-
  form to the so-called ideal, tend to have various parts of their
   bodies bunch up and billow out of the edges.

Word is that the thong bathing suit doesn't have this problem, and
 women (and men?) of all kinds of shapes and sizes find them quite
  flattering.

Or so I've heard.  I haven't seen any thongs on the beaches I go to.
 Then again, I haven't seen any bathing suits on the beaches I go to.
  &lt;_Jym_&gt;

In Brazil, the thong is called "flosso dentale" or whatever the Portuguese
for dental floss is.

                FANZINE OF FANZINES, NOT TO BE MISSED BY FANZ

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Mike Gunderloy
    6 Arizona Avenue
    Rensselaer, NY 12144

    is publisher of a wonderful fanzine of fanzines called "Factsheet
    Five", published five times a year.  You'll find it at places like
    alternative record stores and science-fiction bookstores, but you can
    subscribe at $2 per issue for up to six issues.

    This thing is wigged out, a window into a hundred, a thousand, strange
    worlds.  Mike audits and reviews somewhere between a myriad and a
    plethora of privately published magazines, newspapers, cassette
    recordings and genuine what-not.  Here are just a few samples that
    caught my eye.

    - SPYBASE ($35 from Micro Associates, PO Box 5369, Arlington, VA 22205):
    This is what software should be: quick, easy to use, bulletproof,
    unique and useful.  SPYBASE is a specialized database, with something
    over 75,000 citations to references on 38,000 or so people and
    individuals in "the intelligence community, the right wing, Latin
    America, the East Coast foreign policy establishment, domestic
    surveillance, assassination theory, and big business."  Author Danial
    Brand has painstakingly indexed hundreds of books and periodicals, from
    COUNTERSPY to the WASHINGTON POST to books by Agee, Hougan, and
    Oglesby.

    - Midwest Personal Security (PO Box 228, Ulysses, KS 67880) bills itself
    as "the only security company catering exclusively to America's
    struggling left."  In particular, they sell various size sprayers
    filled with CS military tear gas for $7 and up -- to folks who
    guarantee they meet their own state's possession requirements,
    naturally.

    - A.C. Samish sent along another three sheets of bizarre art, including
    strange machines, physics, excited engineers, and half-naked women,
    along with bits of collage and cryptic messages of great urgency.  You
    can get your own copy by sending a 25-cent stamp to him at 2118
    Guadalupe #191, Austin, TX 78705.

    - The World Series of Poker is hosted every year by Binion's Horseshoe
    Casino &amp; Hotel (128 Fremont, Casino Center, Las Vegas, NV 89101).  You
    can get on their mailing list and receive glossy publicity brochures
    about this wonderful event, just for the asking.

    - ZIGGURAT (PO Box 25193, Rochester, NY 14625) has issued a new edition
    of Mickey Spillane's I, THE JURY, "Abridged for the Modern Reader": all
    the way down to 4 pages, leaving in only the most essential sex and
    violence.  A copy can be yours for $1.

    - AMERICAN WINDOW CLEANER #14-15 ($6 from 27 Oak Creek Rd., El
    Sobrante, CA 94803):  A trade publication which is fun to read --
    you'll be amazed at how sophisticated the window-cleaning industry has
    become.  #14 reports on a new world record set at a recent convention,
    gives some hints on writing contracts, and of course discusses the
    latest in tools and techniques.  #15 loosens up a bit, with snappy
    comebacks to stupid questions and a feature on the windows of
    Disneyland as well as the usual serious stuff.

    - CHICKEN SLACKS #3 ($2.50 FROM Mary Fleener, 309 Oceanview Ave,
    Encinitas, CA 92924):  This is the Soul Issue of this comic of
    illustrated song lyrics:  Jim Siergey doing Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Ken
    Struck doing Muddy Waters, Mark Martin with Marvin Gaye, and many more.
     Lots of love and strange characters here, getting down to the funkiest
     silent music possible.

    - JUST COWS ($14.95 from Video-SIG, 1030-C E. Duane Ave., Dept. FS-5,
    Sunnyvale, CA 94086):  The title of this video is perfectly
    informative; this one is indeed 17 minutes of just cows.  It's an
    "ambient" video, designed to provide background visuals without
    requiring a lot of attention, and does that admirably well.  Cows
    sitting, lying, standing, eating ... just about everything but cows
    mooing, although there are snatches of fiddle music overlaid now and
    then.  Perfect to confuse your friends.

    Factsheet 5 is a 110-page mag full of tiny type and I'm tired of typing
    but you might want to send $2 to Mike.  Tell him you read about it in
    Desperado.  That should drive him crazy, something he hasn't heard of
    in a medium he doesn't even cover.

    There are thousands of artistic and/or political initiatives of various
    kinds in this mag, and not a single one of them shows any signs of
    having received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities,
    OR, matching funds from the federal government.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

   TO ME, THIS KIND OF STUFF ILLUSTRATES THE STRENGTH OF OUR LANGUAGE, THAT IT
 CAN BE SO BADLY MISHANDLED, AND YET, THE INTENDED MESSAGE ALWAYS COMES THROUGH

    foot heave in sight, tootle the horn.  Trumpet him melodiously at

    vigor.

    Two signs from a Majorcan shop entrance:
        - English well talking.
        - Here speeching American.

"To stop the drip, turn cock to the right" is just plain speeching American,

                         Dangerous Virus!

First, a little history.  The X window system escaped from Project
Athena at MIT where it was being held in isolation.  When notified, MIT
stated publicly that "MIT assumes no responsibility...".  This is a very
disturbing statement.  It then infiltrated Digital Equipment
Corporation, where it has since corrupted the technical judgement of
this organization.

After sabotaging Digital Equipment Corporation, a sinister X consortium
was created to find a way to use X as part of a plan to dominate and
control interactive window systems.  X windows is sometimes distributed
by this secret consortium free of charge to unsuspecting victims.  The
destructive cost of X cannot even be guessed.

X is truly obese - whether it's mutilating your hard disk or actively
infesting your system, you can be sure it's up to no good.  Innocent
users need to be protected from this dangerous virus.  Even as you read
this, the X source distribution and the executable environment is being
maintained on hundreds of computers, maybe even your own.

Digital Equipment Corporation is already shipping machines that carry
this dreaded infestation.  It must be destroyed.

This is what happens when software with good intentions goes bad.  It
victimizes innocent users by distorting their perception of what is and
what is not good software.  This malignant window system must be
destroyed.

Ultimately DEC and MIT must be held accountable for this heinous
*software crime*, brought to justice, and made to pay for a *software
cleanup*.  Until DEC and MIT answer to these charges, they both should
be assumed to be protecting dangerous software criminals.

Don't be fooled! Just say no to X.

[The following is in extremely fine print across the bottom of the page]

X windows.  A mistake carried out to perfection.  X windows.
Dissatisfaction guaranteed.  X windows.  Don't get frustrated without

This is just confirmation of my long-standing suspicion that somewhere
(quite possibly in the tunnels at MIT) there is not just an X-windows cell,
but a sly, sinister, super-powerful "X" agency devoted to foisting all
kinds of strange, savage software on an unsuspecting but mysteriously
willing-to-buy-it world.  My list so far consists of

                    X-windows
                    TeX
                    UniX

Note the suspicious recurrence of the symbol for the unknown in all these names.
Who knows of others?  Or are they "unknown" at this time.

    The MBTA was never like this!
     &lt;_Jym_&gt;

No, but the MTA was.  There was a conductor on the D train (New York
City, BMT/IND) circa 1974 who was recognizable, and slightly famous,
for his hearty, cheerful announcements of stations.  The announcements
would always end "This is the Dynamite D train; have a fabulous day",
with some polysyllabalic and cheerful word substituted for "fabulous";
he never seemed to repeat himself.  Promulgators of the stereotyped
mellow/tense dichotomy might do well to ponder this.  Perhaps each was
a small-scale social reformer, compensating for the excesses of his
own tribe.

Subj:   Too young to rock&amp;roll, too old to wet my pants!

I've been quiet about this for a long time, but I feel that it's time to
come out of the closet:

It was in Binghamton, back in '56 or '57.  Temple Israel's annual Purim
Festival was approaching, complete with costume competition.  My mother,
whose taste generally ran more to Doris Day, decided to dress me up like
The King.  She slicked down my hair, painted on long sideburns, squeezed
me into a pair of tight pants, sprang for a toy guitar (an extravagance
almost unheard of in those days), slapped a coupla coats of light blue
paint on a pair of old shoes, et voila -- I was the original Elvis
impersonator!

Jews have never been bothered by "the devil's music" -- we've always had
real problems to worry about, like being massacred -- so, after the gala
Parade of Costumes, I blew away the feeble competition, easily winning
first prize in the boys' division.  Afterwards, one of the local papers
had me pose for a picture with the girls' winner (Queen Esther -- big
deal).  "But Elvis didn't live in the time of Queen Esther," I pointed
out, making my lips go all pouty, just as He did.  The working press
told me to forget about that and play for the queen, which I did.  The
moment lives on in a faded clipping somewhere among my parents' papers.

I got out of the Elvis impersonation business before all the amateurs
crowded in, and I don't regret it.

Perhaps it's a result of OD'ing on the Three Stooges, or perhaps it's terminal

this would happen), but I just can't figure out that part about the Maginot

to be serious?

    Dear Wilf,

    Was it funny?

    But seriously folks, it was just a little thing I wrote about the
    Maginot Line, which I think is a misused metaphor.

    Don't expect everything in Desperado to make sense, be funny, be
    serious, or be wonderful.  It be what it be.

   From: Jonathan Ostrowsky &lt;jo@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM&gt;

   This is the title of a Plume paperback scheduled for November
   publication.  The ad sez, "Short, snappy, totally hilarious, this
   outrageous collection of 500 all-real, all-weird news stories culled
   from mainstream newspapers proves that the world is not merely insane,
   but completely out to lunch!  Categories include:  "Reasons Not to Call
   911", "Least Appropriate Uses of Condiments", "Incompetent Criminals",
   and "Nude Behavior".

   The authors are Chuck Shepherd, John J. Kohut, and Roland Sweet.

"The Metro", San Jose's hip entertainment weekly, (roughly equivalent
to the "Boston Phoenix") contains a column called "News of the Weird"
by one of the above authors.  I'm guessing that the book is a
compilation of this stuff.  It's real good.

&gt;From this weeks column:

  Watermans Art Center in Brentford, West London, last year reported the
  penis from the life-sized statue of Priapus, Greek god of fertility,
  had been stolen.  The sculptor, Philip Core, had made the penis
  detachable to prevent its being snapped off in transit.

  Anthony Antone, 66, on Florida's death row for a gang murder,
  complained earlier this year that the 2300-volt electric chair might
  jolt his "astral counterpart" and thus ruin any subsequent existences
  that he might have.

  The state welfare office removed an 8-year-old girl from the home of
  Lucedale, Miss. inventor Joseph Newman, 52, after he claimed that (on
  orders from God) he had married both the girl and her mother.

  In separate incidents this year, waves of exploding toilets were
  reported in Seattle, Wash., and Fordyce, Ark.  Fordyce officials blame
  it on the accidental injection of propane gas into a city water line.

  Yvonne Bell, 39, was fired as the director of the Canton, Ohio, drug
  prevention program after she flunked two urine tests for cocaine.  She
  had volunteered to take the tests to lend credibility to the program.

Subj:   stumbled across this today.  it was in answer to chuang's request for
        information for the newsletter.  I still like it, and it's good for
        a laugh even if my BA is from 1977, not 1987.  MM

Ed,

For better or for worse, here are my answers to your questions.  Feel free to
quote any or all of this drivel in full or in snippets.

1)  I own a 1987-model BA from Tufts University (alias Futts U.) with a double
major: English and Biology. This means I am qualified to eloquently describe my
nausea and disgust while dissecting laboratory animals.  Actually, this answers
both questions 1 and 2; does this mean I get extra points for brevity and
efficiency?

3) I have been at DEC for 1 year and 1 month, or in numbers 1.08462 years,
which is wrong, thus explaining why I am not a programmer in Finance (unless I
can figure a way to put this talent I have with numbers to work for me
there... ;^)  I spend my time here at DEC writing user manuals disguised as
Gothic novellas and playing my badge number on Megabucks.

4) I have studied advanced first aid, having, in previous incarnations, been
both an EMT and a Medical Technologist.  I have studied Microbiology out my
wazoo; if you need to know about agar plates, I'm your man.  All of this
uniquely qualifies me to be a software writer, yes?

I took an unnamed-degree in Computer Data Processing from the Cambridge
Institute of Computer Programming in 1983:  thus started my life in the world
of bits, bytes, blinking cursors, bug-infested software, and late-night cursing
at the unblinking eye of the dreaded VDT (or something like that.) When asked
why, I reply that there's no money in Pet Refinishing (my first love) these
days, and besides, I think the Digital Badge is really cute.   And IBM makes
everybody wear white shirts and dark ties, a fashion look that simply doesn't
go with my coloring.

I am presently studying comparative religions because my pre-spouse is Jewish,
I'm a recovering Catholic, and our children will likely ask all sorts of
potentially embarrassing questions like "Dad, Mom:  did the Diet of Worms
REALLY undercut the theological basis of transubstantiation?"

So there you have it, and if you publish most of this stuff I'm sure you'll
have somebody after your ass.  So, when they come, I'll plead insanity;
you just stick to your story that this is what I sent you and you'll probably
get out all right.

Sincerely,

Michael McGovern

Subject: Some background on the French Farce

On the off chance that no-one else has provided this, I came across
some background information on the infamous French Farce.  Here are
some extracts from "The Australian", Tue Sep 12, 1989:

        The ministry said the mixup occurred because a central computer
        misread magnetic bands on some 41,000 files [ mag stripes? ].
        ... the amount of the fines was not affected by the mishap,
        meaning that speeding tickets were transformed into pimping
        offences but carried only a F360 fine.

        Motorists ticketed for failing to stop at a red light were
        fined for "importing unauthorised vetinary medications",
        while those whose only offence was crossing a solid white
        line on the road were charged with "night fishing in a place
        reserved for fish breeding".

    And just for good measure, here's some brain damage that doesn't
    particularly have to do with Unix, but does increase one's interest in
    George Bush's personal health and safety:

        In an August 11 interview on Cable Network News, the head of the
        National Space Council, Vice President Dan Quayle, explained why
        the US should undertake a manned mission to Mars: "Mars is
        essentially in the same orbit.  Mars is somewhat the same distance
        from the sun, which is very important.  We have seen pictures where
        there are canals, we believe, and water.  If there is water, there
        is oxygen.  If oxygen, that means we can breathe."

I guess there turned out to be no oxygen there.

Well, there we go again Desperados, another desperate Friday afternoon
