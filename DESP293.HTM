        THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A DIGITAL (AND MAYBE EVEN A DEC)

 The following is from a *new* Digit, walking in to get that badge
 with oh *such* a high number.  As my number one son said to the
 author upon his taking his job, "Now you'll join the many thousands
 who once worked for DEC."

        Oh, I'm doing OK.  Digital is an interesting place; I am
working in Cambridge, but my first day I was supposed to report for
indoctrination, I mean orientation, in Maynard.  I was an hour late
(thought it was at 9:30, not 8:30, what an ungodly hour), but it
didn't matter because they didn't know who I was anyway.  So I waited
in the lobby for about 45 mins (not a DEC employee yet, I wasn't
allowed in the building) while they tried to sort things out.
Finally, they decided I was who I said I was and gave me a package of
materials and sent me back to Cambridge.

        Of course I had to go back to Maynard a few weeks later to get
my badge (they can't make them in Cambridge; we're just a research
organization with very little infrastructure).  I drove out there with
another new employee and promptly got lost.  I had been to Maynard
only once before and when I was told that this time I needed to go to
the other building, I blithely assumed I knew what was meant.  The two
of us ended up driving around the Mill parking lot, which is huge and
almost completely abandoned now.  I had never been there before, but I
was sure that digital must be somewhere nearby; the big red brick
buildings conjured up some kind of corporate image that seemed right.
In the end we found a parking lot with about 40 cars in it.  We went
in and talked to the security guard there and after a little confusion
he explained to us that we needed to go back to Wendy's (that seems to
be the most salient reference point for digital's current corporate
headquarters).

        At any rate, the sight of those enormous empty parking lots
really drove home for me just how much this company has hemmoraged
over the last few years.  This lab has had some similar woes; more
than half of the offices here are empty, and in fact two people have
announced their departures during my first three weeks here.  But all
is not bleak; my immediate neighbors seem fairly committed, happy, and
focused on working together, so there is hope.

        the flood of objects.  Thus lovers

&gt; "Every word is an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness."

As a physicist I would argue that this is not redundant -- silence is
the absence of wave motion in a medium, nothingness the absence of the
medium (the vacuum).  Sometimes we achieve nothingness; silence is a
second best; words perturb both the vacuum and the atmosphere.

This could lead us to the question of the physical vacuum, which isn't
exactly empty in QED, but I'm not going to open that can of
fluctuations.  As Nabokov wrote in _Ada, or Ardor_, "Who cares about
little things when afloat in infinite nonthingness?" (Nonthingness is
not a typo, in case you were wondering.)

I saw "A Great Day In Harlem" over summer vacation with a friend of mine
at the Michigan Theater, a beautiful restored old-style movie palace in
Ann Arbor Michigan.  I'm not a huge Jazz Buff but it was a very enjoyable
film, certainly moreso than the other independent movies I saw this summer
("Kids" notwithstanding -- all the critics love it, but it was really pretty
base exploitation -- like a sleazy, overstated version of those 50s
juvenile-delinquency films with 90s production values.  I'm going out on a limb
slamming it, but I don't care -- I saw it and I wasn't that crazy about it.)

To: tompar@world.std.com
Subject: Your article on the Dead

I saw a copy of your article on the dead, and liked it.  Except one
part:

"Prokofiev wrote his "Classical Symphony"
to shut up the people who said he couldn't write one and then went
back to doing his thing."

Utterly false.  Nice theory, but not true.

In the first place, the symphony is not classical.  The title is
sarcastic; the music is full of puns and mimicry of classical form.
It's music that could not have been written until the twentieth
century.

In the second place, if he had written a straight symphony in the
style of Haydn, it would have doomed him.  People criticised Prokofiev
because he couldn't write in the style of Berlioz and Liszt; they
wanted him to be a Romantic composer, not Classical.  It was quite
radical for Prokofiev to write something even vaguely in the classical
style, nobody had done than for a hundred years.  It was a similar
stunt to Shostakovich's twenty-four preludes and fugues.

As for why he wrote it, he usually composed at the piano.  But that
can impose a pianistic style on the music, so he decided to try
something different:

"I had been toying with the idea of writing a whole symphony without
the piano.  I believed that the orchestra would sound more natural.
That is how the project for a symphony in the style of Haydn came into
being...It seemed to me that if Haydn had lived to our day he would
have retained his own style of writing while absorbing something of
the new.  That was the kind of symphony I wanted to write.  And when I
saw that it was beginning to jell I called it `Classical
Symphony'--firstly because it was simpler, and secondly just for fun,
to tease `the geese,' and with the secret hoep that I would win in the
end if the symphony appeared classical."

I know a lot more about Prokofiev than the Dead; I hope your article
was more accurate when it spoke of them.

 I was dead right about the Dead.  I told my Prokofiev story just to
 tease 'the geese'.

 Every word is a stain on silence and nothingness.
