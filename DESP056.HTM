A solution to the "problem" of VMSMAIL:

If you want your Desperados to scroll gracefully across your screen, just
type "FILE TT" when you start reading it. If you're especially lazy, you
can even abbreviate "FILE" to "FI".

Professional wrestling has emerged unscathed from its period of
ghastly soul-searching of the 70s.  It seemed for a time that the
phony "authenticity" movement was enfeebling wrestling.  While nobody
really wrestled Greco-Iowan (the boring intercollegiate way),
there was a definite feeling that the pros were only going through the
motions.  Even Classie Freddie Blassie and the Grand Wizard seemed
lackluster and the Japanese villains were only marginally less
admirable than lovable Chief Jay Strongbow.  In fact, other than
the Tibetan death-scratch hold, I can't recall any really impassioned
controversy in the past five years.

It seems though that wrestling is getting hot again.  Maybe the
Depression has taken hold but Superstar Billy Graham has shaved his
golden head and shed his psychedelic T-shirt. Big John Studd (7'8") is
lurking around waiting for a fight against Andre the Giant. The Angry
Samoans are *tearing*up* the tag-team circuit.

Because they can communicate in Samoan and look exactly alike, these
grinning 300-pounders in bare feet and knee-length black tights are
bamboozling referees and double-teaming opponents and generally
travelling completely outside the realm of decent human interaction
(although they do deserve respect as the former world tag-team
champions).

I had the privilege of seeing Andre the Giant and Jimmy Superfly Supka
tangle with the Angry Samoans in a tag match.  As you know, Jimmy
Superfly Supka is a Fijian and quite angry with the Angry Samoans for
misrepresenting the Polynesian people.  Jimmy went after Samoan Number
One (named Oopa, I think), but Samoan Number 2 (Oppa) grabbed him and
bashed him while the ref wasn't looking.  This went on for some time,
while Andre the Giant paced in frustration outside the ring.  Jimmy
Superfly Supka was so bewildered by his beating that he could not find
his corner and tragically kept wandering into the Angry Samoans corner
trying to tag up with Andre.  Finally, Andre could not stand it any
longer and risked disqualification to surge into the ring and bash
Samoan heads together.  Finally, Jimmy Superfly Supka found the right
corner and Andre pretty much cleaned house, switching easily from the
double head butt to the blocked suplex to the double clothesline and
finishing up with the grand gesture of having Jimmy Superfly Supka
climb on his shoulders and dive bomb down on a prone Samoan leaving
his bloody body to be dragged from the ring. Wow!  What a matchup!
What a match!  Color man Gorilla Monsoon could hardly believe what he
was seeing and he's seen it (and done it) all.

But that was as nothing.  Next came the real shocker.  Bob Backlund,
the straightest of all straight arrows, was fighting an ethnic boaster
named Rick Marasco, but Rick was pretty much having his evil way with
him.  Backlund, who used to be so good at appealing to the referee to
bring an end to miscreancy, actually attacked and knocked down the
ref! He was disqualified, of course.  Marasco was being interviewed
in the hall when Backlund jumped him from behind!  Four other
wrestlers held Bob down while Marasco escaped.  Gorilla Monsoon
thought Bob might be having a nervous breakdown.  I was speechless.

All that we need now is the restoration of women's professional
wrestling to TV.  It should be much more interesting now that women
are liberated.

Now I am not slumming here. I find it really exciting.  Professional
wrestling is an improvised acrobatic morality play performed by
skilled actor-athletes, more akin to the commedia del'arte than the
boxing match.  Sportswriters and other ethical specialists profess to
believe that it would be better if these gentlemen were really trying
to whale the tar out of each other, but if that happened the Texas
death cage would live up to its name.

These people are big and strong and graceful and full of adrenalin and
also smart and stylish.  It is only snobbery to pretend that the
wrestling audience is any less capable of a willful suspension of
disbelief than is the theater audience or the movie audience or the
novel audience.

On Wednesday's Nightly Business Report they had a story on the current
climate in Silicone Valley.  In short, things are now looking up for
some firms (e.g. Intel), but not others (e.g. Fairchild).  Their wrapup:

        The companies that will benefit the most from the economic
        recovery are the ones that did the best when the chips were down.

Moving right along, there are two weird ads running repeatedly on Business
Times (recently started on ESPN; 6:00 a.m. repeated 7:00 a.m.).  One
is from Sperry, touting their Office Automation products;  it starts out
by proclaiming that the computer is 'the most awesome invention of the
20th Century.'  Seems odd then that we have no growing public outcry for
an international microcode freeze.  The second ad is a corporate image
puffer for W.R.Grace.  It opens with the solemn pronouncement, backed
by very dramatic video, that 'With alarming speed, the American economy
has slowed down.'

p.s.  Business Times has a High Tech feature story each day at 6:40, repeated
at 7:40 (again, that's a.m.).  Not much depth, naturally, but sometimes
interesting.  p.p.s. for serious early birds-&gt; Nightly Business Report
is repeated the next morning at 5:30 - it's on CNN.

Came across the following in a project plan for one of DEC's upcoming
personal computer products:

       "The product will be sold worldwide, with the possible

I assume this isn't an attempt at levity.  One wonders why wallaby
ranchers in the outback have been singled out as ineligible to share
the blessings of this new machine, while goatherds in Afghanistan will
soon know its joys.

In today's Wall Street Journal is a three-page ad for NCR's new 9300
"VLSI Mainframe".  One of its new features is described as follows:

        3.  Guarantee your data integrity with memory scrubbing

        NCR's newly patented memory scrubbing method cleans the
        9300's four megabytes of main processor memory every 16
        seconds!  It does this by correcting any transient
        single-bit errors - effectively eliminating catastrophic
        double-bit memory errors.  All of this is done automatically
        by the Address Translation Chip with no central processor
        overhead.

I guess they must be using "scrubbing bubble memory".

Did you ever wish for a handy-dandy phone list on your tube?   You could  get
one  if your system's got ALL-IN-1, but otherwise you were out of luck unless
you wanted to write your own.  Well, I have something for you:  a DCL command
file that will maintain a phone list for you.  PHONEBOOK will create, add to,
edit, type out, and purge old versions of your list in addition  to  doing  a
substring-match search to find people.  It will also handle deleting or modi-
fying existing entries.

To install PHONEBOOK, just do this:

1.  Create a logical definition in your LOGIN.COM file that looks like this:

                $ define pbook$dir [&lt;directory_name&gt;]

2.  Store PHONEBOOK.COM away somewhere.

3.  Create a personal command in your LOGIN.COM to execute PHONEBOOK.COM.

The first time you execute PHONEBOOK, use the Create command before anything
else that references the list file.  To get a list of commands, type a ques-
tion mark.

If you'd like a copy, just let me know; I'll mail it to you.  Be sure to let
me know if you have a VT52 - it takes a special version...

If you have questions, I'll be glad to answer them as best I can.

Because you can't see the person who is sending you electronic mail
you are sometimes uncertain whether they are serious or joking.
Recently, Scott Fahlman at CMU devised a scheme for annotating one's
messages to overcome this problem.  If you turn your head sideways to
look at the three characters :-) they look sort of like a smiling
face.  Thus, if someone sends you a message that says "Have you
stopped beating your wife?:-)" you know they are joking.  If they say
"I need to talk to you :-(", be prepared for trouble.

Since Scott's original proposal, many further symbols have been proposed:
(:-)   for messages dealing with bicycle helmets
@=     for messages dealing with nuclear war
&lt;:-)   for dumb questions
oo     for somebody's head-lights are on messages
o&gt;-&lt;|= for messages of interest to women
~=     a candle, to annotate flaming messages
{=   for messages about housing (or &lt;= in the Snow Belt, [= in Arizona)
||   for messages about cars or other four-wheeled vehicles
|    for bike fleet messages
-&gt;-  for airline tickets going cheap
O+   is more appropriate for women's messages, surely?
#:-) for people whose hair is in a mess, like mine
$$   for academic jobs, $$$ for industrial ones, $$$$ for people starting up
       their own company
%    for bike accidents (a bit far-fetched, I suppose)
/\   for camping and backpacking
*|   for oh what a beautiful sunset
**   for winter sports generally
O!   for "Oh Wow, look at the moon!" or any other California-speak msg.
&gt;:-( 8  *&gt;-  for disparaging opinions on feminists.

So you see, bit-map displays are really quite unnecessary :-&gt;

My understanding of constructs akin to "... a friend of Jack's" is that
they are equivalent in meaning to phrases of the form "... one of Jack's
friends" (which differs slightly from "... Jack's friend", as it carries
the distinct implication that Jack has more than one).  I'm not sure
whether I was taught or just came to assume that this form ("... a friend
of Jack's") is one of the many instances in which English permits elision
of information made redundant by context, and in reality stands for a
phrase of the form "... a friend from the set of Jack's friends".  Since
this last form is far more at home in mathematical notation than in
conversational English, and since our language abhors limiting concepts
to a single expressional form ("... one of Jack's friends") when additional
and more involute forms are available, we have this marvelous double
genitive - an appellation of which I was ignorant until this very
morning - to take the place of the mundane single genitive construct to
which it is equivalent.  Despite its resistance to syntactic analysis,
in conversation it actually works fairly well.

Subject: the whole nine cubic yards

     Nice try, SPIDER::COLLIER, on the origin of the expression  "whole  nine
yards", but I'm not convinced...

     My Dad used to work for a concrete supplier (I've been inside the  mixer
of  a  concrete  truck:   big  stuff  when  you're eight years old).  I still
remember all the photos that ringed his  office  of  the  various  models  of
concrete  trucks  that  Colonial  Supply had used over the years.  The family
picture was sandwiched somewhere between a picture of a 1947  truck  and  one
from the fleet that replaced it in 1961.

     Underneath the pictures were the specs for  each  truck,  including  the
capacity  in  cubic  yards.   To  the  best  of  my memory, around WWII, con-
tractors were using trucks with capacities of 3 to 5  yards:   in  the  early
1960's,  a seven-cubic-yard truck was about as big as you could get.  I don't
think nine-yarders came around until the late '60's.  If anybody really gives
a shit, I'll call my Dad for figures more reliable than my memory.

     I don't know exactly when the expression  in  question  started  getting
widespread  use,  but  it  seems to me that it's been around longer than nine
cubic yard concrete trucks.

a half of mail from all round the world (they estimate they have 2
million cards and they get about 2000 more with each day's post).  At
one point the Fraud Squad was called in to investigate but they
quickly decided that everyone involved had acted in good faith and
that no money was involved.  The CB club and the Post Office have
appealed to people not to send any more cards as they are getting
swamped.  If you know of someone who is innnocently passing the story
on then please let them know the real situation.
