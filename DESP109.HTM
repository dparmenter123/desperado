Stockholm, who just flung himself even further.

I have not edited this because I like it the way it is.  Some
Americans might not know that when he mentions 'boogies', he means
'bogies', which most of us would call 'trucks', by which we all mean
the wheel arrangements on railroad cars.

Subject: ** how i got from Stk01:: to Hgov01:: **

    no tom, i've not yet returned from my trip yet. this mail is written @ the
DEC office in Kowloon/Hong Kong.

    i will now try to describe how i have travelled, what i've found strange,
etc. i do hope this mail will not be too boring. please have in mind the text
to follow are thoughts and impressions OF MINE. watch out for spelling errors
and funny sentence constructions!!!

getting started
---------------

    the trek started the 1st of july, by taking a boat from Stk01:: to helsinki
(finland). stayed there a couple of hours before taking a train to moscow.

moscow
------

    hanging out of the train window and taking pictures of armed border police
is not recomended -- they "overexposed" my film ... despite i quoted "Ussr is
a free country and you have *no* right to take my film". arrived in moscow in
the morning of the 3rd. as usual, one is assigned to an intourist guide, who
will make sure you are busy enough not to explore anything on your own.
[intourist is the one and only tourist org. in Ussr ... they have guides that
can speak most weird languages, such as swedish, and that can handle stupid
political questions in a most diplomatical manner].

    since i've been in moscow before, i found there was nothing new except
for some propaganda posters. actually, i found this guide took me to the same
places as the previous guide did -- two years ago. you will normally here
phrases in the form "worlds *est *", such as worlds largest library, etc.

    this is not too amusing. i therefore spent most of my time mumbling with
our swedish speeking guide, named tanja. [there are virtually no pretty girls
in moscow, by swedish standards. however, my guide was quite above moscow
average]. so much of moscow. in the afternoon of the 3rd the "real" train
departed.

transsiberian
-------------

    there are three different trains crossing siberia, two are russian and one
is chinese. they all use the same track to ulan ude (just past the bajkal
lake). here the chinese train turns southwards and heads for ulan bator (in
mongolia) and finally for beijing. one of the two russian trains will enter
china in the northwest corner (mauchuli) and then head for beijing. the last
one of the trains will go all the way to the eastern end of the track,
wladiwostok (where you later can take a boat to yokohama/japan).

    two years ago, i took the russian train to beijing, via mauchuli. this
time, i took the chinese train via mongolia.

    there is definitely a difference in the atmosphere on the two trains. the
personel on the russian train is not *happy* while the chinese is. i thought
i would have a chinese restaurant car all the way from moscow to beijing, but
that was not true. we started with a russian, changed into a mongolian and
finally into a chinese, as we crossed the chinese border ... mumble.

    riding the train is not like comuting to work. the train constantly moves
and after a while you begin to feel like you will live the rest of your life on
it. you meet other western travellers on the train [a.k.a. neighbors]. most of
them come from europe. individual travellers are more fun than groups, since
the groups have everything arranged and do not really understand all the BS you
have to go through every day.

    outside the train, an endless landscape passed by. it slowly changes from
mixed pine/leave into leave and finally into grass and desert. if it were not
for all these cities, one could really play a "live" D&amp;D game out there.
sometimes there are small villages ... right out in the middle of nowhere. i
must admit it is very hard to describe the scenery with words [therefore i took
a lot of pictures].

    the train stops two or three times a day, for about 5 - 15 minutes. there
is no warning when the train is about to leave the platform, why it is wise to
stay close to your car, after the first 5 minutes. i cannot imagine all the
trouble one has to go through if missing the train [lost in siberia without
a Vax].

    i belive Ussr has more manpower in their army than the Us, since most people
seems to work for the army in one way or another. wherever you go (in moscow
or elsewhere) you *always* see uniformed people. trainstations is no exception.
on a generic station, about 20% of the people waiting (?) on the platforms wear
olive green uniforms.

    the restaurant car [yes .. there is only one] serves food only during
certain hours [the open hours are given in local time ... while the timetable
for the train is in moscow time ... for a while]. the Ussr restaurant car has
an impressive menue ... but only a vast amount is available [only those dishes
with price marks *may* be available]. the restaurant car serves as a meeting
point for most western travellers. here you can find other strangers that you
later can bring to your compartment for a game of poker or a bottle of vodka,
bought on the black market. also, bribing the waiter with US$s can be very
useful ...

    on some stations you can buy food from locals, quite cheap, such as bread
and beverage [the food on the stations serves as a good supplement to what is
served on the train].

    after some days we arrive at the Ussr/Mongolian border. the train stops and
you go out to change your remaining rubles (if you have any) into US$. make
sure you do not have more rubles when you leave than what you have "legally
changed" ... [selling jeans in moscow for fantasy prices is a good way to add
some money to your budget ... but you may get more for one pair of jeans than
you can spend during your entire stay ...]. i don't really know why the train
has to stop for more than 2 hours here ... but it did. outside it is pitch
black. looking out from the train you may see armed guards, in the dim light
of the train.

    we were finally told to go back to our compartments, since the train was
about to leave. GLONK GLONK (noise from cars bumping into each other when the
train is starting). so ... this is mongolia. it was darker than pitch black
outside and only the light from the train helped me to see what was outside.
the train is *very* slow when crossing the border. they must have sent some
100 messages to and fro to make sure this was not an enemy train [strange ..
since mongolia is one of these countries Ussr has "helped"]. i figure the
train must have creaped in 20 Km/h for about 30 min before we reached the
other end. on the way there i saw a cat defecting to mongolia.

    so here i am, in the country of djingis khan. "same procedure as last
year?" is a good question at this border. now we have to fill in the same forms
as we just returned to the russians. this took two hours ...

    my first question was -- "where can i change money?". no ... you can't
change money. here you pay only with western currency. thank lord i brought
some US$ in cash with me. as the russian restaurant car closed long before we
reached the border ... i was quite hungry by now. it was about 1:30 at night.
no ... there was no warm food to be found in the restaurant car ... but i
bought three cans of lowenbrau, brewed in munchen/w. germany ... the "salesman"
in the resaurant car claimed they had been flown in from germany. he even
claimed he had a lower price on coke and marlboro (made in the US) than what
you could find in the US itself. well ... smiling i took my lowenbraus and
walked back to my compartment ... i must admit 80 cent per can of ice cold
lowenbrau, brewed in W. germany, was quite cheap to be in the middle of
nowhere.

    the mongolia you see from the train is like a big lawn [perhaps suitable
for jumbo golf]. the population seems to be mostly nomads, living in round
white tents out on these lawns. at some places they have gathered more tents
into little villages. the feeling of travelling across a gigantic lawn for
hours and hours cannot be described in words. the air is super clean, and
looking straight up in the sky is the same as looking straight up from an
airplane at 10000m ---&gt; the sky is not really blue, rather blackish. if you are
lucky, you may spot some stars in the daytime.

    the train stopped for 30 min in ulan bator, the capitol of mongolia. the
crowd on the platform surely looked mongolian. unfortunately it was not very
easy to take pictures. i've been told one can request a permit to stay in
ulan bator for one week. [next time ... i though].

    we passed throught some beautiful mountains. on the other side is the
gobi desert. soon i saw camels. it's not a real sand desert, more like a stone
desert. but oh so beautiful. the sky was covered with small white clouds, the
sun was shining, they sky was really blue, the ground was yellowish and the
air smelled so fresh and ... yes it is really breathtaking. i don't know how
many hours i hung out of the window just looking.

    at sunset we reached the mongolian/Prc (prc = peoples republic of china)
border ... and now we have to deal with these forms we filled in not too long
ago.

    2 hours later ...

    the train started to move towards the great country. entering a chinese
border station up here is something special. the whole stationhouse is lit up
by lamps of various colors (looked like 24th of december to me). the platform
loudspeakers tell us (in several different languages) exactly what is waiting.
how we should fill in the forms, where to change money, etc. the chinese
border personel is extremely polite. they introduce themselves by name and ask
other polite questions that have nothing to do with the forms. the forms where
simple to fill in and a few minutes later i could leave the train. i rushed to
the bank to change money then back out to the chinese restaurant car, which
was in operation despite not being hooked up to the train itself. had a nice
meal while they changed boogies on the traincars!!! the tracks in Ussr and
mongolia are wider than the ones in china ... why they have to change the
wheelboogies. as a matter of fact, they had multiple tracks by the platform so
that both a russian boogie and a chinese boogie could be used at the same
platform. see figure below:

                ==================================

                            Platform

    this stop cheered me up. after about two pleasant hours my "home" started
to move towards beijing. it made a few stops, among them at a part of the great
wall. pictures pictures ... i also washed my face in ice cold water on the
platform ... great feeling, since it was beginning to get a bit hot and humid
now.

    passing through a well cultivated landscape i arrived in beijing on the
morning of the 9th. hey ho, all stuff i packed and here i go. out on the
streets with some other travellers i met on the train.

in prc
------

    in prc they have somehing called Cits, china international travel service.
you *must* book all your hotel rooms and train tickets through them ... they
say. this is only true in the major cities. however, beijing is one of these
major cities. so, i've got to find cits. the street map i was equipped with
turned out to be useless. only a 1/10th of all the streets were marked on the
map, why beijing looked like a small village. thus, one block on the map *may*
not be one block in the real world. this makes a great difference if you are
carrying a backpack looking for a place not marked on the map, asking
non-english speaking people for help. after some 60 minutes we finally reached
the Cits office in beijing. i got a cheap hotel (about US$ 10 for a triple).
the hotel was quite nice. since i do not remember it's name asking for "the
hotel at the end of bus no. 20" will get you there too.

    most hotels in the low budget world (normally called hostels) have a
surprise somewhere. this hotel only had water available at "certain unknown"
hours. going for a shower was always a gamble. also, the elevator did not work
when i wanted to use it.

    the local transportation in most chinese cities is quite good, unless you
are out late for some reason. most destinations can be reached for about 2-5 Us
cents. however, there is a catch here too ... do not attempt to play gentleman
when getting on and off the bus, since you will either miss the stop or not get
on the bus. something that looks like a line will form before the bus arrives.
however, as the bus pulls in, this line turns into a great mass of people, all
pushing at the door(s) at the same time. you do not wait for people to get off
the bus and be aware of that they close the super hydralic doors while people
are still on their way in/out. some good advice: do not attempt to enter a full
bus if you are carrying a bag of eggs ... unless you like scrambled eggs. also,
the average chinese is shorter than the average swede, why standing upright is
not possible, unless you push your head out through the roof ventilation.

    the first word you learn in mandarin is "maeyo", which means something
negative based upon context. the simplest form is NO. asking for something,
such as a beer can result in "maeyo", which means you should not expect a beer
to materialize in front of you. doublechecking with another waither is
recomended, since your pronounciation of beer in mandarin may not be completely
understood, or the first waiter may just not want to get you a beer, or
something else.

    in resturants one encounters several problems. the first one is that you
will get a western style menu. if you like the real food you should have an
english speaking chinese with you ... but that gives you another headache.
foreigners pay between 2 and 5 times more than the locals and the local you
have with you may have to pay a weeks salary for the meal he normally would get
dirt cheap.
    the western menu has numbered dishes (like in chinese restaurants in
the western world) so that the waiters should be able to decode your wishes.
however, since they rarely understand any english, pointing between 18 and 19
and asking for number 18 (in english) may result in number 19. if you see a
good dish some chinese is eating at the table next to you, pointing at it may
result in "maeyo" ...
    if you go in to these "real" places where the peasants eat, there is no
such thing as english in any sense. therefore you should bring a piece of paper
and a pen with you. you should then walk around the tables and look for food
you would like to eat. when you find something that looks good, show the paper
and the pen to the guy eating the stuff and try to make him write down the name
of the stuff in chinese. then you should put a number in front of the dish so
that you do not get 15 bowls of noodles instead of one. i remember being in one
of these places with another fellow. we managed to get a certain type of
noodles written down on paper and then go and order the stuff [i forgot ... you
must first order food tickets before you go and get the actual food]. they had
two types of sauces, probably soya and redpepper. so, in order not to risk to
much food, we decided we should have the black stuff on one of the bowls and
the red on the other. the girl smiled after we waved our arms for a while and
then put BOTH the black stuff and the red stuff on BOTH bowls ... this red
stuff turned out to be tabasco ...
    in these real local restaurants you may find their way of eating somewhat
primitive. you normally spit out bones and other undesired shit on the floor or
on the waxed cloth [no, i've never seen anything but waxed cloths]. then, try
to calm down and look at your rice bowl if the person next to you does a
"deep-lunger" and spits it out on the floor followed by a circular movement
with one of the sandals ["deep-lungers" are quite common in prc, since most
chinese people seems to constantly be having semi-colds].

    during the summer, watermelons play a vital role in the diet. people are
eating watermelons all over the place ... spitting out seeds right where they
stand, dropping the shells right where they stand.

    i've seen 2 cats and 2 dogs during my whole stay in prc. there are
virtually no birds in the cities. they've killed them all, some years ago. you
can not have a dog for fun, you must have a good reason, such as being blind or
running a dog-meat restaurant.

    bicycles serves as the major transportation device in prc. only in beijing
there are 4 milj bikes. all over the place you here these bells ringing. it is
probably less dangerous to walk in n.y.c. with closed eyes than to go out in
the streets of beijing during rush hours.

    there is no "bells&amp;horns-culture" in prc. they are definitely misused.
in some cities you can sometimes get this feeling, when you are crossing the
road, that you would like to shout "eat your heart out!!" in mandarin.

    it is important to understand one cannot behave like in sweden when in
a hotel ... i went through a 20 minutes hearing with two local policemen just
because i ran naked from the shower to my room ... mumble ...

    do not expect to find "bars" in prc. bars are normally lit up and they
rarely have music (or smoke). the prices are quite ok ... but you will not have
the same feeling as at your favourite bar at home. also, when you've just got
the steam up they will close the place down. here people go to bed around
21:00, except for shanghai where they finish at 23:00. best bar is "seamens
club" in shanghai.

    if you like disco ... you better bring a walkman with you ... since a
chinese disco is not what *I* call a disco.

    when you are in this part of the world, information of what is happening
outside rarely reaches you. someone may have nuked away my home without me
noticing anything. sometimes you may get hold of a one day old 'herald', but
you will most likely end up with 'china dayly', since 'herald' can only be
found in the *major* cities.

    i found shanghai to be one of the more interesting cities. it does not
really have piles of monuments and temples and parks, but it looks sort of
western style and the people are friendly and helpful. still, "western style"
is not equvivalent with "just like home". i stayed in a hotel across the street
from seamens club (cross the bridge by friendship store). they charged US$ 4 a
night in a dorm with air-cond.

    if you decide to take a bicycle-taxi -- then make sure to agree on the
price *before* the trip starts ... i made the mistake once ...

    a good place to spend the day is the YU-garden in shanghai (in the old town
.. quite hard to find). in there is a nice tea-house (in the middle of a nice
fish pond, surrounded by two zig-zag bridges). they charge about 30 cents for a
pot of tea, including refill(s) (buy a ticket at the bottom floor). best place
is on the second floor, where the windows are open and a nice cool breeze blows
through. on monday afternoons they have a local band there [retired people who
play traditional chinese music]. there is no extra charge for it, but you may
have a hard time to find a table.

    i must admit the above text gives few clues where i've been, but here is
my route ... so far:

    Stk01:: - Helsinki - Moscow - Beijing - Xi'an - Wuhan - Shanghai - HK

some hints if you go there yourself
-----------------------------------

    one of the easiest ways to enter prc is from hong kong (i came with the
train rather than flying straight to HK and then enter prc. there are two
types of visas, transit and tourist. the difference is the transit visa is
only valid for a certain number of days (normally two weeks) and cannot be
extended more than a couple of days. here in HK you can buy a prc visa for
HK$ 70 (about US$ 9) @ time travel service, chung king mansion, 16th floor,
block A (on nathan road).

    the best prc travel guide, is "china off the beaten track" a.k.a. "china
and the beaten tourist". i don't know if you can get a copy in the US, but it
is very easy to get here. in it you find the cheap hostels and some hints on
how to reach interesting spots using public transportation rather than guided
tours. the "china guidebook" is more for high budget travellers, but contains
lots of historical facts about the different cities. perhaps both is a good
combination?

    i believe that you need at least 4 weeks to see anything in prc. rushing
around is not the way to "do prc".

    i've never flown with CAAC (the domestic airliner in prc) but i've been
told it's not like what you are used to in the west ... prices are about twice
as high as if you would take the train over the same distance.

    the cheapest way of transportation is by boat, but you can only reach a few
spots by boat. one of the better tours is to go upstream yangtse river from
wuhan to chongqing (takes 5 days). myself i went downstream from wuhan to
shanghai. it took two days and i paid US$ 13 for a bed in 3rd class.

    you must have lots of patience (and piles of napkins if you tend to cry
when things *really* f*ck up).

    do *not* carry too many things with you. about 10 kilo should be far enough
[however, i must admit my backpack + expansion bag was 30 kilo when i reached
hong kong ...]. i prefer a backpack before a suitcase, since a backpack is
easier to carry. however, if you are in a tour group, or if you tend to take a
taxi when you cannot read the map, it makes little difference.

    i am in hong kong. truely the home for people who like the "latest
and greatest" in terms of fashion, hair-styles, high-tech equip, cameras,
etc. i like this place. there is only one hook -- you tend to spend *too*
much money. there are shopping arcades here out of this world. i believe
i would be able to write a book on "how to backpack the arcades of HK". most
of these gigantic arcades are connected with each other through magic tunnels,
two floors below ground level. here you can certainly get lost when you are
out shopping. it's so funny, because sometimes you find these little tiny tiny
doors in between some stores on the street. you walk down the stairs and
zip zap you are "lost in space".

    if the world likes it, i can write some info about HK.

    any questions about prc and whatever can be sent to my account in valbone,
Isola::Hamnqvist. i'll be leaving HK the 20th for some islands in the Us,
some hours off the west coast ... perhaps i'll write a story about that too?

truely,

p.s.    I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PEOPLE HERE @ THE HK FOR THIS ACCOUNT AND
        ALL THE OTHER HELP I'VE RECEIVED [such as "save hk$ 2.60 @ wendies"
        cupongs and "this is the best disco in town" ...]

           GIMME THAT OLD-TIME AZTEC, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Here's some info on DEC's hot new low-cost single spindle double disk.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: JAKE::LEWIS
To: KERMIT::PARMENTER
Subject: Aztec means A-Z technology

        I have found that Aztec is getting bad press from people who
know little about how it was designed and how the architectural decisions
were made.  Here are some responses to the most recent comments about
Aztec.

        1.  Fixed plus removable on the same spindle : first of all,
you are very wrong in saying that no thought was put into how the
software would handle it.  The stall-I/O issue was discussed many times,
and it came down to two options; make a fixed plus removable or make
two drives.  The decision to make a fixed and removable in the same
package was based on marketing information which in essence showed a
good marketplace for that kind of drive.

        2. Why not a clutch?  A clutch is good in theory, where you
can spin down the removable cartridge with the fixed disk spinning.
However, when you start to think about what it would take to do something
like that and keep radial runout, particle count, speed variations
et al to a small enough level, you can quickly see why a clutch is
about as practical as a stick shift and chrome headers.

        3. Backup : Backing up the fixed disk is simple, since the
cartridge has the same capacity as the fixed disk.  Backing up the
cartridge is more difficult, especially if your operating system is
on the fixed disk.  But tell me, how many disk drives on the market
give you easy backup of your cartridge in a single package?  I haven't
seen many "dual cartridge" drives around.  It is well known that
if you want easy cartridge backup you have to buy another cartridge
drive.  Here I recommend the dual RC25 master/slave configuration, which
gives you two RC25s on one controller and host interface board.

        4.  Where oh where shall the operating system go?  Don't
worry about it too much, it will work on the fixed OR removable disk.

        A final comment : The RC25, as with every other product Digital
makes, has features which some people don't like.  But right now we can't
make enough to meet the market demand, which indicates that there are
plenty of others who like what it has to offer.  The LCN folks think that
it's a pain, but still good enough to use as their system drive.  If you
don't like it, don't use it.  But don't tarnish the reputation of my group
with self serving comments that have little basis in fact.  We always
welcome constructive ideas to help us do better next time, but don't take
kindly to global mailings with jokes about a product we busted hump for
four years to make.  Sometimes I wonder if we really do all work for the
same company.

Sure, we all work for the same company . . . and we all sometimes
wonder if we all work for the same company.

Nobody pays any attention to me, Bill, don't worry about it.  What's a

Today is Childrens Day at Digital Westminster and by sheer luck we have
discovered a secondary feature designed into the helicopter pad. It is an
excellent "break dancing mat". Because the glass walls of our cafeteria
face the front lawn and heliport we were able to make this new and wonderous
discovery. We noticed kids spinning on their backs and heads and thought
to ourselves what a great ideal the guys in corporate had when they decided
to put this little multifunctional item in. Obviously the guys doing all the
thinking in Maynard had this planned all the time. We owe them a lot (our
paychecks inclusive) for pacifying the little ones. Thanks guys, and to
everyone else, let's start breakin'!

I have to share this with someone...

The other morning, while driving to work (Bedford, MA), I saw a car with
a Mass license that said ``IBM-QC'' (not PC, QC), and an ``I (heart) DIGITAL''
bumper sticker.

I'm not fond of them either.  So, for my own amusement, I've taken to
substituting "have sex with" instead of "love" for the &lt;heart&gt; symbol.
This leads to funny visions of people in compromising positions with
Dobermann pinschers, Chevrolets, and the state of Vermont.

Somebody went me one better.  When I walked in a few weeks ago, I saw
a standard "I &lt;heart&gt; NY" bumper sticker.  But over the &lt;heart&gt;, someone
had applied a printed round sticker reading "F*CKED" in vibrant red
letters.

Subj:   EVOLUTION

In this rapidly evolving computer world, complexity is increasing at a
faster rate each year. To keep up with the evolutions and revolutions,
one has to forget about "the way we used to do it" or else fall by the
wayside, trampled by young engineers who have accepted the new waves
of complexity.

One sees frustration in DEC that is voiced as lack of leadership from
the top. In truth, the top couldn't give the narrow direction required
by people that can't accept the increased complexity. The reason for
this is simple, there is not a simple product set or strategy that can
be defined to fill todays markets. At any point in time, DEC must
continue with present directions and strike out in at least one, maybe
two new directions. When one looks back at DEC history one finds that
we really have been doing this all along. Today, the degree of the
total complexity is rather overwhelming.

We don't have unlimited resources to develop product, and product
takes finite time to develop. This means we always have gaping holes
in our product offering or the market has moved and our products
haven't. This adds to the  frustration of individuals trying to
understand DEC's strategies in this complex world.

Examples:

1. dumb terminals, smart terminals, workstations and three
kinds of PC's

2. multi-user systems and applications distributed to PC's

3. radial serial, lans, and PBX's

4. Ethernet, sync comm, Broadband and CI

5. Propriety systems, 68000 based, Z-80 based, 8086 based...

6. Collision detect, multidrop, token passing, packet
switching

7. Fortran, Cobol, C, PL-1, Basic....

8. DECNET, MAP, SNA

9. VMS, UNIX, CP/M, MS/DOS, RT-11, RSTS, RSX...

10. U bus, Q bus, BI bus, CI bus, SI bus...

WE are doing all the above and much much more. This is an indication
that we really are not in serious trouble.

DEC only gets into serious trouble when we try to force all solutions
through one solution set or give one group who has a single solution
set attitude, responsibility for a critical part of our product set. A
good example of a single product and a single product attitude is the
group who used to push Ethernet as the interconnect solution for all
terminals to host interconnect problems. They actually canceled
development of all future products such as DH and DZ replacements for
some time in the Ethernet craze period.

The job of top management is therefore to provide enough direction
that we don't overextend our development resources but at the same
time to strike a balance so creativity is not stifled. Also, they must
watch to ensure that all our eggs are not in the hands of one group
that corners all development in a critical product area.

This will give us competing products, products that never make it
because of lack of resources but it probably won't give us products
like the IBM PEANUT that was such a miserable and costly flop. It will
give us excellent products, some like the VT100 that become very high
volume and others like the PRO that look like failures but keep
winning increasing market share with time. It gives us a very rich
product set and a variety of choices that are frustrating at times but
never boring!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Some say the Pro will be bringing in about $100 million dollars this
year.  See the most recent PRONOTES.

If we rented the largest hall in NYC and put on a new edition of
DECtown in combination with Dexpo and DECUS, the whole country would
be talking about DEC.

In the meantime, at least we don't wear ties much.

 I hope this is the appropriate forum to get these burning questions
answered.

1)      Is the orderly removal of a node from a VAXcluster known as a
        VAXectomy?
2)      Should we adopt CABBAGE_BATCH as the new default batch stream
        name?
3)      Is the state just before votes go below quorum known as a
        "cluster's last stand"?
4)      Is a VAXcluster located in Plains Ga. known as a peanut cluster?

Perhaps not, but an irrational fear of being enclosed by a collection of
interconnected computers is known as clusterphobia.

And the Trappist monks have requested some hardware to automate their
production of jams and jellies, only they want to call it a VAXcloister.

The following is the last paragraph of an article in Electronics Week, Aug. 20,
1984, "IBM jumps up a level with multiuser PC":

        "To help sell its PC family, IBM plans a promotion in conjunction with
Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. of Cincinnati.  IBM computers will be promoted on boxes of
P&amp;G products.  Consumers will receive fliers in the mail offering certificates
worth $100 off the purchase of PCjr systems."

Sounds to me like IBM has decided that it ought to sell PCjr like a bar of
soap.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Actually, they're selling 'em like the free dishrag *inside* the box
of soap, or maybe the beautiful iridium bracelet, a $6 value, yours
for only $2 and four boxtops.
