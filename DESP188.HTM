    George Winston, infamous piano noodler, had this to say to the Boston
    Globe:

    "I know what I play.  I play pop instrumentals.  Where I come from is
    the soul, R&amp;B and pop instrumentals of the late '50s.  My piano playing
    is real influenced by Sam Cooke's vocals, Booker T and the MGs, the
    Ventures, King Curtis.  First people said I was playing classical.  I
    said, no, I play pop instrumentals. Then they said jazz. I said, excuse
    me.  I'm not jazz.  Pop instrumentals.  Then they said New Age, and I
    said, no, no, my stuff all has a beat to it.  All the Windham Hill
    stuff I've heard has a beat to it.  I do pop instrumentals.  Well,
    finally, I started feeling if I keep telling someone my name is Tom and
    they keep calling me Jim, well, this conversation's over."

Subj:   Chuck Jones's autobiography!

Coming in October.  Review taken from Publishers Weekly.

CHUCK AMUCK:  The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist.
Chuck Jones, foreword by Steven Spielberg.  Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux,
$24.95.  ISBN 0-374-12348-9

Film animation, like comedy, is an art of timing, writes Jones, and in
this short, unpretentious, amusing memoir, the director of Bugs Bunny
cartoons and inventor of Roadrunner, Coyote, and romantic skunk Pepe Le
Pew discloses secrets of his comedic craft.  Part of the team that
created Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, Jones spins stories about a favorite
uncle, a family cat hooked on grapefruit and why his father detested
Warren Harding.  He reminisces about attending art school during the
Depression, his early years at Warner Brothers, the creative mayhem
surrounding the birth of some of his classic cartoons.  With gemlike
anecdotes, Jones pays tribute to directors, fellow animators, writers, a
sound-effects specialist.  He cursorily covers his career since leaving
Warner, which includes the production of TV specials ("The Cricket in
Times Square") and films ("The Phantom Tollbooth").  Photos not seen by

Subj:   More thoughts on the "breaking wind" story heard on WBZ

Tom, I have to admit that I'm probably well above the stated average
in the story, but I'd have to say that quality is more impressive than
quantity.  I think that most people would agree with me, depending on
what you use as metrics (sound or pungency, just to mention two).

This was etched permanently in my memory sometime in my teen years when a
friend and I stopped for a cup of coffee in a diner.  Unfortunately, my
friend chose to "break wind."  The result was that the diner was very
quickly emptied of people, including the owner/operator!  I still break
into uncontrolled laughter when I think of it more than 35 years after the
event :*)

APn  06/01 0930  Thong Ban

Copyright, 1989. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

   NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- The bottom has fallen out of beach
wear this summer, and that's upsetting people who would rather look
the other way.
   "We've had maybe a dozen young women we have asked to cover up or
leave the beach," said city waterfront director Norma Jean Page.
   Part of her job lately has been to keep the beach free of the near
nudity of thong or G-string bathing suits which leave the bottom bare.
   "It's really no big deal. We just tell them we have had a city
ordinance since 1976 against revealing certain parts of the body,
including the buttocks.  When they understand that, they are very nice
and leave," she said.
   The suits are specifically outlawed in North Myrtle Beach. But
women who sport the skimpy wear have not been fined or hauled off to
jail, just asked to leave the beach.
   Mark Kalb of the Pineapple Beach Surf Shop said the trend started
in earnest last year and the open-air suits are even more popular this
season.
   "These suits don't appeal to the conservatives, although everybody
pretty much takes a look at them."
   South of North Myrtle Beach, in Myrtle Beach, there are no specific
bans -- except for outright nudity -- and few complaints about the
risque swimsuits.
   "We looked at the same ordinance North Myrtle Beach has, but our
biggest problem would be with enforcement," said Myrtle Beach city
clerk Mandy Tomz.
   "There is such a wide area of beach to cover, and there are so many
people on the beach, it would be very difficult to pick and choose
whom to send away, and that would not be received well."

    SYD STRAW

    Syd Straw's "Surprise" album doesn't have quite the concentration of
    pedal steel and beer-drinking tunes that her Golden Palominos stuff
    has, but it's no surprise to hear how good it is.  Featured players
    include Richard Thompson guitar solos and Michael Stipe on vox humana,
    but the real draw here is Syd Syd Syd Oh Syd, how you can sing!  Not
    only does she sing lead, but she also sings wonderful harmony with
    herself.

    And Syd's a writer.  There are some real Costello-worthy lines in this
    album.  "I found the good in good-bye."  "We are like angels in heat/We
    have a lust for life."  Also, "Please put me out of my mystery."  She's
    the producer of the album too.

    The "hit" should be the one about her sphinx (with Thompson solo):

        Sung: "My sphinx is a jinx/She's had too many drinks/Stood on too
        many brinks/And got the shove."

    Other standouts (I have my tape, but not the album, so I'm not sure on
    titles):  "His Turn to Cry", "(I'm lookin' through your) Heart of
    Darkness", "Almost Magic", "Crazy Americans (Continental Drifters)",
    and everything on the album.

    NY Times say:

    "Every few years a bohemian female singer emerges whose combination of
    talent personal charisma enables her to become a pop star without
    playing by the rules. Syd Straw...belongs to a tradition of wilfully
    offbeat personalities like Patti Smith, Rickie Lee Jones, and Cyndi
    Lauper. Although she has not yet had a hit, her just-released debut
    album 'Surprise' is already creating a stir. "

    Editor Emeritus Neilsen-Steinhardt say:

    I'm running right out, aren't you? And I now know what I want to be
    when I grow up, Tom. Wilfully offbeat. Words to live by!

    (Actually, I might want to take my life's direction from a remark made
    about her band, which includes *post-punk stalwarts* Dave Alvin on
    guitars and D.J. Bonebrake on drums.)

    I say:  Not the band on the album.  Now onward.

    K.D. LANG (pardon the caps, k.d.)

    Short hair and no makeup.  Big deal.

    Last year's "Angel With a Lariat" is k.d. with her own band (the
    Reclines) in pretty much of a cowpunk mood with lots of fast tunes
    (mostly originals) and hard-rock fiddle playing and only two slow
    songs, one a Patsy Cline. High energy.

    The recently released "Shadowland" is a Nashville album. k.d. enticed
    Owen Bradley out of illness-induced retirement to produce it.  Bradley
    is the legendary founding father of the Nashville studio sound and
    owner of Bradley's Barn, the studio immortalized in a Beau Brummels
    album of yore. Anyway,  "Shadowland" is a much slicker album (which is
    obviously what she wanted) with a Nashville all-star studio band and
    several Patsy Cline songs and a number of standards, including one of
    my all-time favorite pop songs, "Black Coffee".  There's also a Chris
    Isaak song, "Western Stars", and a honky-tonk-girls medley with Brenda
    Lee, Loretta Lynn, k.d., and the all-time-champ honky-tonk girl Kitty
    Wells.  A sweet, nice, lovable album that some may
    find a tad over-produced.

    k.d.'s newest, "Absolute Torch and Twang", is just that.  How much more
    do you need to know?

    There's some good cuts that reflect her days on the prairie,
    particularly in the dance-halls, telling of what music means out there.
    "Big-boned Gal from Southern Alberta" and "Wallflower Waltz" (with the
    opening line "Are you getting scared, my dear?").  There's also cowboy
    music, the could-be Western-swing classic, "Coyote", "Tall in the
    Saddle", and Willie and Waylon's "Three Days": "Three days, filled with
    pain and sorrow/Yesterday, today and tomorrow."  A heartbreak song
    almost maniacal in despair: "Didn't I?"

    "Walkin'" with the Original Five Blind Boys of Alabama (legendary black
    gospel group) on the chorus.  Rockers:  "Big Big Love", "All My
    Troubles".

    And finally, a real funny one aimed at all those folks (men) who are
    scared by her short hair, no makeup, gender-bender presentation:  "All
    that hairdo/It ain't me/I am showing what I am . . . I'm not askin' for
    the world/I'm not an ordinary girl/I wanna be all you want/But all you
    get is me."

    Not to forget that not only did k.d. grow up in Saskatchewan, she also
    played performance artist in LA for awhile.

    MARIA MCKEE (ex Lone Justice)

    Maria McKee quickie review:  I've only listened to the album twice, but
    what a lot of sadness she expresses.  The band and producer are off the
    last Richard Thompson album and RT plays guitar and mandolin on the
    album.

    Maria's a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice, but her persona on
    the album is unloved, unwanted, hungry for affection.  Very moving.  My
    only complaint at this point is that almost everything ends in a fade,
    even songs that ought to just STOP!  Pretty good lyrics and stories.

    MICKEY BONES (Swamptone records)

    Mickey Bones is a Boston drummer madman singer with the Hubcaps (pop),
    Boogaloo Swamis (zydeco) and Screaming Coyotes (blues).  I haven't seen
    him live but I have his new album (with The Hubcaps, featuring Digit
    Brian "AQUA::" Rost on bass).

    First, Mickey is one swinging, rocking drummer.  He has that loose
    sound with the simple rhythms that you usually only hear when two
    drummers play the same thing at the same time.  He's a great man on the
    snare drum, sounds almost New Orleans, but the bass drum is so
    underrecorded I can't tell if he's got that Magic New Orleans foot or
    not.  But no one will be asking the question:  Is this a studio guy or
    a drum machine?  It's unmistakably real drumming.

    Second, the band sounds live.  It was recorded at Fort Apache in Boston
    and I assume only the vocals are dubbed.  Very peppy instrumentation,
    lots of saxes, plus harmonica, fiddle, and on one cut a Dixieland band!
    This may be the first rock'n'roll record ever with a real-sounding
    Dixieland band. I always hated Dylan's "Rainy Day Women" for that fake
    sounding Dixieland.  There's also some great sax breaks and a couple of
    "sax riots".  Lots of acts that are killing live just don't make
    it in the studio but Mickey and the Hubcaps show tons of live energy.
    The best local comparison is with Barence Whitfield and the Savages,
    whose studio albums just don't have staying power.

    Third, the songs are all old rock'n'roll (not rock, which is what CSNY
    play) songs done up in a real 90's way.   Most of the vocals have some
    kind of processing -- Mickey can handle anything from a pleasant
    baritone to a nasal screech through a bullhorn -- and the tempos are up
    over the original recordings. Mickey does tunes by Professor Longhair
    ("In the Night"), Lazy Lester ("Lover Not a Fighter"), Roy Orbison
    ("Mean Little Mama") and a few other folks I didn't recognize.  (The
    liner notes are sparse. Original artists aren't listed, except when
    they wrote the song, and musicians are just grouped, e.g. "Horns"
    followed by a list of names.)  My favorite cut is "Monkey Time", the
    old Major Lance tune and one of the sweetest "do-the-named-dance" songs
    ever written.  On Mickey's album it's done with fiddle obligatos.
    Another favorite is the old C&amp;W number "No Help Wanted" from The
    Carlisles.  (Mickey might be interested in tracing down the Carlisles'
    saga of retail merchandising, "Half Off", featuring the chorus, "Our
    clothes are all half off.")

    This is a happy, rocking album of old-time music done up in best modern
    style, not punk rock, but maybe punk rock'n'roll.

    LYLE LOVETT

    This man has "star" written all over him.

    Lyle Lovett has a hatchet face, slit eyes and mouth, great (truly
    great) pompadour, a large band, sly lyrics, swingin' tunes, a real nice
    smile (if you hang around long enough), a strong affinity for cowboys
    and beatniks, a great love for women, a special on the Nashville
    Network last month, an audience consisting of C&amp;W fans, folk-rockers
    (Fairport Convention types), and music'n'fun lovers, three hot albums
    (of which Pontiac is the one to start with), and a life-long place in
    my music collection.

    Sample lyric:

        She hates my momma and my daddy too
        She tells me that she hates the things I do
        She likes to lie beside me most every night
        She's no lady, she's my wife.

    NEVILLE BROTHERS

    The latest Neville Brothers album, "Yellow Moon", shows what having a
    producer is all about.  None of their other albums has been half as
    successful because of weak song selection and too much self-indulgence.
    The producer, Daniel Lanois, once produced a U2 album (not a high
    recommendation in these quarters),  so I figure he learned on them and
    applied it to the Neville Brothers.

    Highlights:

        The title song, a good love-song/rocker.

        Aaron Neville singing "With God on Our Side" turns this smug Dylan
        song into something worth listening to.  "Hollis Brown" is another
        Dylan song, and a chiller.  Aaron also sings "A Change is Gonna
        Come".  Amazing!  Three Dylan songs and I like 'em all.  Aaron
        might even be able to worthwhilize "Blowin' in the Wind".

        "Fire and Brimstone" with the Dirty Dozen Brass band on a Link Wray
        song.

        "Thank You Miss Rosa", a long chant type thing about Rosa Parks,
        who started the Birmingham bus boycott and the modern era of civil
        rights.

            THE MAGINOT LINE, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT, DADDY?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    The Maginot line was an elaborate arrangement of fortresses built by
    the French to protect them from the Germans before WWII.  The whole
    business was designed from individual pillboxes and minefields up to
    gigantic mile-wide concrete domes sunk hundreds of feet into the earth.

    When people say "Maginot line mentality", they usually mean complete
    and foolish reliance on some war technology to prevent national harm.
    The Germans, of course, went around the Maginot line and invaded France
    through the low countries.

    In fact, the Maginot line worked fine.  The Germans did not attack
    anywhere along the Maginot line.  Their attack was channelled into a
    narrow area where the French *could* have flanked them, but the French
    were so cozy behind their "shield" (the Line), that they forgot that
    they also needed a "sword" (the capacity to hit back).

    The Maginot line put the Germans right where the French wanted them,
    but the French forgot what they wanted to do with them when they got
    them there.

                                    =*=

    New twist on an old joke:

    Q: What's the difference between computer salesmen and car salesmen?

    Old A: Car salesmen *know* they're lying.

    New A: Car salesment usually know how to drive.

                    WHAT I SAID TO THE OLD NEWLYWEDS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    Some old friends of mine, old hippies at that, just had a 25th wedding
    anniversary that included a "remarriage ceremony".  It was *nice* and
    reminiscent of the good old days of VW busses and ecstatic garb.  We
    wore bells and did it all outdoors (on the rocky shore at Two Lights
    State Park in Portland) and the happy couple read Khalil Gibran "On
    Love" and everybody stood in a circle and read something about love
    from some classical source or other -- The Bible, Erich Fromm -- or
    reminisced about these two. My wife's reading was the chorus from "You
    Are My Sunshine".  Then we sang the Shaker hymn "'Tis the gift to be
    simple" and I read Khalil Gibran "On Marriage".  Like I said, old
    hippies.  Then came my part.

    "We can all identify with Khalil Gibran because he tried to make it as
    a poet in Boston, but maybe you don't know that he also revolutionized
    Arab poetry.  Before he came along, Arab poetry consisted mainly of
    classical and court themes, but Khalil Gibran came along with poetry
    about real people and their lives and loves.

    "And love is a radical idea.  Here are these two people who have
    decided that they know something that nobody else knows and that it's
    more important than anything anyone else knows and they're going to
    keep it to themselves.

    "But love is also a conservative idea, because everybody else knows the
    same thing.

    "So, in the spirit of radicalism, I pronounce you two free animals,
    running, leaping, swimming, and diving together for as long as you
    like.  And, in the spirit of conservatism, I pronounce you man and
    wife."

        So, you've never seen the 3 Stooges routine about "Niagara Falls",
        eh? (that's the "Slowly I turned, step by step... inch by inch..
        and I ...!"). In the movie short they did covering this, Moe and
        Larry were performing an outdoor play (they were playing actors in
        this one), and Moe was relating a hard-luck story to Larry about a
        woman he was in love with, that ran off with some slick- talking
        {whatever}... and he chased them all over the country, and, as he
        put it, "...I finally caught up with him in Niagara Falls."

        "Niagara Falls?" says Larry... at which sound, Moe lights up,
        turns, and shouts, "NI-AG-RA FALLS!!! Slowly I turned....step by
        step... inch by inch... AND I.....!" ... whereupon he proceeds to
        demonstrate graphically, what it was he did to the guy he was
        chasing, to Larry (typical 3 Stooges mayhem). Needles to say, the
        crowd they were performing for, loved it.

        At the end of this particular short, all 3 of the boys get married
        to their girlfriends of the time, and decide to honeymoon in New
        York State. Guess where? At one point, they have Curley get out of
        the car while they're pulled over, to walk ahead and read a road
        sign. One of the signs told them they were in "Goslow"... the other
        said, "Niagara Falls"... soon as he reads it, Moe starts in with
        the "NI-AG-RA FALLS!!!!! Slowly I turned.... step by step...inch by
        inch..." with the car, chasing Curley up the road with it.

        For what it's worth!

Subj:   Desperado #2017 (no soap and slowly I turned)

Two elephants were sitting in a bath tub.  The first one asks the second one,
"please pass the soap."  The second elephant replies, "no soap, radio!"

        Not funny, you say?  That's the whole point.  The joke is a practical
        joke.  One person tells the joke to a group, all but one of whom are
        in the know.  Everybody except the mark laughs uncontrollably.  The
        mark is left wondering what is going on.

"Slowly I turned, step by step..." is a vaudeville routine with one man who
warns another never to remind him about Niagra Falls, which is where he
strangled his cheating wife.  As he remembers the scene, he says "slowly I
turned, step by step, then I grabbed her by the neck and..." all the while
moving towards the other man menacingly and then grabbing him and starting
to throttle him.  The other man calms him down, and then says "I'll be sure
never to mention Niagra Falls," whereupon #1 repeats "slowly I turned, step
by step..." and repeats the throttling demonstration.  The schtick repeats,
with #2 always managing somehow to mention Niagra Falls and get throttled.

Abbott and Costello, among others, used this routine.  It shows up in one
of the A&amp;C movies, except that "Susquehanna hats" is the phrase, not
"Niagra Falls."  Lou Costello is a salesman for the Susquehanna Hat
Company, and there's a man whose wife or girlfriend was wearing a
Susquehanna hat when she left him.  He winds up destroying almost all of
Lou's inventory before the scene is over.

Re. your comment in Desperado that you'd never actually heard that.

I've heard it -- not as the punch line of a joke, but as part of
a comedy skit/routine. I think it was the "Niagara Falls" skit,
and I forget who I saw do it (Three Stooges? Abbott &amp; Costello?).
Plot goes something like this: Seemingly normal guy recounts how he
goes into a rage whenever he hears the phrase "Niagara Falls," since
it reminds him of his faithless ex-wife, and Niagara Falls was where they
honeymooned. The guy tells of several occasions when some poor unwitting
soul happened to mention that phrase, whereupon: "Slowly I turned, step
by step, inch by inch [and clobbered the unfortunate guy who mentioned
Niagara Falls]." Of course, in the recounting of each incident, his
demeanor goes from calm to frenzied (to calm to frenzied etc.).

I think I even recall seeing it parodied in a cartoon. Perhaps Daffy Duck?

Anyway, although I unfortunately can't remember the specifics very well,
I definitely did hear "Slowly I turned, step by step..."

Subj:   Jokes

When I was in high school, there was a practice of telling a highly
obscure joke (it would be a different joke every time) with the
punchline "No soap, radio."  This would be done in a crowd with
several confederates, targeted at one victim.  The confederates would
all laugh, and the victim would feel as if he had missed something.

High school boys are terribly witty, eh?  There wasn't much of a
defense; if you laughed along, they knew you were being a toady, and
you knew that they knew (if necessary, they'd ask you to explain the
joke, to show why you were laughing); if you didn't laugh, you seemed
unsophisticated, and there was no worse sin.  The best defense I could
come up with was to laugh endlessly, depriving them of the ability to
interrogate me about the joke's semantics.

At that time I don't think I was aware that the the phase "no soap
radio" meant radio programs not sponsored by Proctor &amp; Gamble and
friends.

As for "Slowly I turned,", I was always told that it was not a joke,
per se, but part of a line from Lou Costello, whose meaning is not
clear even in context.  But I've never seen the context.

Subj:   No soap radio joke

Tom, as best I can remember it, here's the no soap radio joke.
[Jim, I assume this is to what your mail message referred.]

Two elephant are taking a shower.
The first elephant says to the second, "Please pass the soap."
The second elephant replies, "No soap, radio."

Now, for the explanation:
This joke was devised in the 1950's by sociologists doing
research on pressure put on new members of groups. The typical
scenario for this joke is one in which everyone has heard
the joke before, and *knows* that the punch line is not
funny, but they laugh anyway. The test is to see whether
the newcomer laughs anyway (peer pressure wins over the
newcomer) or the newcomer doesn't laugh and says something
like, "I don't get it."

The joke is not supposed to be funny. But people laugh
because they're trying to see whether the ones who haven't
heard it before can be swayed by the crowd.

Sorry I don't have any sources for this explanation.
I know I didn't read it in any textbook or course notes.
This is just how someone long ago explained it to me.

I used to work for a bunch of sociologists.  In my worst nightmare, I never
dreamed of jokes composed by sociologists with the expressed aim of being
unfunny.  How could they tell them from jokes composed by sociologists
composed with the expressed aim of being funny?

And, speaking of nightmares, I have a collection of social-science studies
performed during World War II on combat soldiers.  How many had nervous
breakdowns, correlations to amount of combat, etc.  How many wet their
pants.  How many made a real mess.  (Dave Barry is not making this up.)
But the real nightmare was a single combat battalion set up to be
experimented upon by social scientists.  Of course, the soldiers did not
know they were guinea pigs, they just thought their officers were crazy,
but they probably weren't alone in that.  It's bad enough to be shot at,
but to be shot at for experimental purposes is really too much.  There's a
TV series in this that would purely blow M*A*S*H away.

Normally, when one's commuter train stops somewhere, the driver announces
 the stop and perhaps some transfer information.  The other day, on the
  Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the driver added the following:

"Remember, whether or not you have a nice day is entirely up to you.  And
 if you don't, just remember that 100 years from now it won't make any
  difference."

The MBTA was never like this!

Sixth Sense
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., is the only member of Congress to have an
assistant assigned soley to paranormal research.  The aide, C. B. Scott Jones,
is paid $48,853 a year to keep up with the latest developments in telepathy,
UFOs and ESP.

Jones says his interest in the subject grew out of an experience he had as a
naval attache in India.  He refuses to reveal details of the experience on the
grounds they "might embarrass the government."

Eleventh Commandment
Bad driving and speeding are sins, Pope John Paul II has declared.  He told
Italian automobile club members who attended his weekly audience that drivers
have a "moral and religious duty" to protect the lives of others and that
every man would have to answer before God "not only for hazardous actions that
endanger one's own and other people's lives, but also for ignoring road
security regulations."

The following appeared in The Jerusalem Post in their Postscripts column:

Silly signs from around the world:

In a Tokyo hotel: Is forbidden to steal hotel towels please.  If you are not
person to do such thing is please not to read notis.

In a Leipzig elevator: Do not enter the lift backwards, and only when lit up.

In a Belgrade hotel elevator: To move the cabin, push button for wishing floor.
If the cabin should enter more persons, each one should press a number of
wishing floor.  Driving is then going alphabetically by national order.

In the lobby of a Moscow hotel across from a Russian Orthodox monastery: You
are welcome to visit the cemetery where famous Russian and Soviet composers,
artists and writers are buried daily except Thursday.

On the menu of a Swiss restaurant: Our wines leave you nothing to hope for.

                            *                 *

At the research facility where I work, someone has hung a purloined sign,
ostensibly bilingual.  The English portion reads: The manageme is not
responsible for any losts on less handed for watch here.

Now I know where the authors of the technical manuals I love to hate are
getting their training.

And so, dat's it for another Desperado.  A friend of mine is planning to
market Instant First Amendment kits: paper flag + book of matches.
