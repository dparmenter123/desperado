        How about that Boris?  Another extremely cool week in the history
        of democratic liberty.  In China, we sold our friends down the
        Yangtze.  In Iraq, we stopped the war two days short.  But in the
        Russian coup we actually put the government's money where the
        American people's mouth was.

        Of course, up until this week, Bush has been having one summit
        conference every twelve weeks or so with Gorbachev, so maybe he
        was afraid he'd never get invited to another one (there being only
        two mighty world powers who could meet, and the Sovs are only a
        mighty world power courtesy of us, because we keep having summits
        with them), but, on the other hand, until he hopped up on that
        tank, our government thought Boris Yeltsin was a flamboyant
        firebrand (which our gov't thought was a bad thing to be), but
        then he turned out to be just exactly that, but now our government
        thinks a flamboyant firebrand is a pretty fine thing (and so do I
        (not to mention my Number One Son, who follows)).

Subj:   quick musings on Bush and Boris

    Bush was funny in his press conference:

        "Now I don't think that we want to get into the kind of a situation
        where, where we are speculating about military options,
        _wouldn't_be_prudent_ ...

        &lt;_pause&gt; (as Bush realizes this is the key word that Dana Carvey
        skewers him with every week on SNL.)

        I think that word is called for in this kind of a situation..."

    Isn't it great?  Bush does Carvey doing Bush.  Bush is truly a semiotic
    man of the 90's.  To his credit, for once he didn't kowtow to the forces
    of reaction.

    I don't think I'll ever forget the picture of Boris Yeltsin standing
    on top of a tank with his fist in the air, telling off the would-be Junta.

    Boris really gives the old 'great man' theory of history a run for its
    money.  What if there had been a Chinese Boris Yeltsin in Tianamen square,
    or in Vilnius for that matter?  Did the events produce Boris, or was he
    just "great?"

    Yeltsin has far more in common with Landsbergis than Gorbachev now.
    Once Yeltsin is in power, freedom for the separatist republics can no
    longer be denied.

    Yowsuh!

    Intoxicating times for democracy buffs.

COMPUTER NETWORKS KEPT INFORMATION FLOWING DURING COUP

By Rogers Cadenhead
Fort Worth Star-Telegram

     DENTON, Texas -- The message relayed from Moscow to a Soviet
immigrant in the United States was brief and to the point.
     "You got out of here just in time," the Russian message
said. "If those dogs win, for certain they'll throw us all in
prison -- we distributed the proclamation of Yeltsin together
with forbidden communiques from Interfax throughout the entire
Soviet Union."
     The messenger signed off, "Greetings from the underground."
     The short note, spread throughout the West on computer
networks, was one of many transmitted during the Soviet crisis.
Borrowing a tactic used by Chinese students during the June 1989
Tiananmen Square uprisings, Soviets used electronic mail, or
E-mail, as a tool against the takeover.
     While messages from Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
other coup opponents were being sent throughout Asia, Europe and
North America this week, the committee that tried to seize power
either didn't know about, or couldn't keep up with, the
instantaneous  transmissions.
     Through database networks such as CompuServe, which set up a
special discussion forum on the crisis, and InterNet, a worldwide
network of universities, military sites and businesses, computer
users transmitted firsthand reports of the crisis.
     Soviets also used the channels to transmit and read banned
news reports from the Russian Information Agency, the Interfax
news agency and Baltic nationalists.
     "Our net turned out to be a means of communication of the
forces of resistance," one Muscovite said. "I am really proud of
it, but it's really dangerous."
     The unprecedented connection was made possible by the
introduction of thousands of personal computers into the Soviet
Union under President Mikhail Gorbachev. This week, it put a kink
into plans to control the flow of information.
     "It is a tribute to our modern Gutenberg revolution,
computer-mediated communication, that at the darkest hour we were
getting almost instant E-mail," said Sam Lanfranco, a network
member at York University in Canada. "It allowed them to be
everywhere and us to be there."
     GlasNet, a Soviet network, is named for the glasnost,  or
openness, that allowed its creation. It stayed on line throughout
the crisis, one network director said, "maybe because GlasNet is
quite new, and the Soviet Pinochets still are not aware of our
existence."
     His name, like all those from the Soviet Union, have been
omitted in this report to protect them, at the request of
American computer organizers such as John Harlan. Harlan is
director of the Russia and Her Neighbors network project, which
has headquarters in South Bend, Ind.
     Soviets who regularly communicated with the West were
surprised that they could still send electronic mail out of the
country after the takeover.
     "They were foolish enough until now not to break E-mail link
with West sites," one man wrote in halting English. "I think this
won't last too long, but I think also that putsch  won't last
long also."
     During the apex of the crisis, eyewitness accounts were
filed by protesters who attended rallies at the Russian
Parliament, the white marble building that has come to be called
the Russian White House.
     "Yesterday, impressions filled me with optimism," wrote one
Soviet who sent many reports beginning, "Hello from Moscow!"
     "All those barricades and many people standing there and
some tanks on Yeltsin's side made me feel more confident," he
wrote yesterday morning.
     "When I came home last night after the curfew was imposed by
the putschists, my wife disappointed me somehow. She sat home
with my little daughter all the day and just watched TV and heard
official reports. She is afraid that [the committee of coup
leaders] has got the great power. As I told her all I saw,
she calmed a little bit, but said that she thinks [the people]
just haven't enough information.
     "For example, the big rally near the Russian White House --
many thousands people there -- were showed on TV as some group of
100-200 people without definite purposes."
     Some Soviets used the database networks to issue pleas for
Western support. "We, the youth of this country, do not want
anybody to bring back the past," one resident said in a message
sent Tuesday at noon. "We need your moral support!"
     The FidoNet system, a worldwide hodgepodge  of computer
bulletin boards, brought messages from several cities.
     "It was big fun to hear and see on TV so nice comedian show
like last press conference -- some very familiar to us," one man
wrote yesterday, referring to the coup leaders. "That was really
fun, to see such stupid faces and stupid talks. No one comedy can
give so lot fun."
     From an American college, Chinese student Jie Liang offered
tips for the Soviets based on his experiences with the Tiananmen
Square protests. Liang, who did not not make clear whether he was
in China or the United States at the time, said computer networks
were a vital link in organizing the rallies and subsequent "Free
China" protests.
     "Western sympathy amounts to little in changing the
situation," he told Soviet members of the network. "The Soviet
people are their own savior."
     Liang said that Yeltsin made the right move by calling for
strikes. "This power is stronger than tanks in the long run," he
wrote.
     He added that Americans and others interested in helping the
popular revolt should use computer networks, fax machines and
telephones to pour the truth into the Soviet Union.
     "At this heavy historic moment, Chinese people are standing
by the Soviet people," he wrote.
     Despite the matters under discussion, the lightheartedness
that typifies electronic mail chatter was still evident through
the crisis. Keyboard smiles and smirks -- represented by :-) and
;-) and meant to be viewed sideways -- punctuated several
messages, and a Leningrad man ended his messages with the
sarcastic sign-off, "Don't worry, be happy."
     There was a :-) on many terminals yesterday when the news
began circulating that the coup had begun unraveling. In E-mail
to Doug Jones at the University of Iowa, the director of a Soviet
network said he would send no more messages.
     Jones said, "As of the most recent contact I had, he said
the coup is over and he was going to get some well-earned rest."

Subject: A report from barricades

Hi everybody!

        Thanks a lot for your support during these terrible days! I'll
send messages to everybody who has mailed to me during these days.
        I think that this information can be of some interest for you,
net-folks. I'll try to post it and I ask my addresses to distribute it.
At least, I'm asking to distribute the main thing:

        DON'T TRUST GORBY!!! In my opinion, there is 90% that the putsch
was organized by him! I heard the excellent saying today:
        &lt;&lt;I never trusted Lenin. I never trusted Gorbachev. I trust him
         only when he told that he is "the true Leninist".&gt;&gt;

        All putschmen were appointed by Gorby, his guard wasn't arrested,
when it was clear that the putsch failed he immediately began to use
phone, etc. He inspired a small riot against him in the Supreme Council
before his vacations: he wanted to show that he didn't agree with
people who organized a "committee" few weeks later. If they win, he'll
return and continue to control the country: all dirty work is done
without him. If they fail, he'll get rid of them and become a hero as a
victim of the putschmen. I hope that this time, after Tbilisi, Baku,
Vilnus, this joke will not work. But you, in the West, still think that
he is progressive... I want you to understand finally, that all changes
happened in our country, took place not because of Gorby, but in spite
of Gorby!!! Remember, that he is the chief of commies, he wanted and
wants to reform the System, but not to destroy it! Now his crew saw
that the end of Communism is knocking at the Kremlin door, and started
their last war against their own citizens.

        After sending the translation of "To the citizens of Russia" I
left the office to join the defenders the White House of Russia. I
spent there two nights and only now I returned to the office to read my
mail. The Echo of Moscow and the Radio of Russia is working now and
they report the situation around the White House, so I can join
defenders again if necessary.

        OK, what I have seen.
        During the first night the White House was defended by 15-25
thousand people and 10 light tanks from Tamanskaya division that
decided to protect the lawful government. Some barricades have been
already built, and the construction continued and I had a chance to
take part in it. No shooting took place that night. A 6-meter dirigible
was launched from the square at the White House and the Russian flag
was seen from many places in Moscow. BTW, the metro station here is
called "Barricadnaya" - there were the main barricades and fights here
during the first Russian revolution in 1905.
        It was an announcement from the Radio of the White House: they
told us about the super-secret psychotropic weapon that could be used
against the defenders. They told that there are some reasons to think
that this weapon was used in Tbilisi and Vilnus. So all symptoms of
aggressivity or super-patriotism could be results of that weapon and
they asked people to watch each other and to keep quiet. Of course,
they also told about "regular" methods as gas and explained how to
protect yourselves. They also asked people to save their lives and
don't fall under tank tracks. "We need your lifes" they said.
        The main events took place on the second night. The front side of
the White House was covered with 100-meter Russian flag. The radio of
the White House used loud speakers mounted on the building.The radio
and TV were occupied by commies, so there were only two sources of
information: first, the radio channel "The Echo of Moscow" succeeded to
stay in the air during the evening, and the Radio of the White House
used the military radio-transmitter car that joined the White House in
the evening. It wasn't powerful enough (it was heard inside the circle
of 10 km in radius) and they had to change the frequency rather often,
because the "committee" tried to jam these broadcasts.
        Yes, many people used some alcohol these nights (ok,ok, me too,
but only 50-100 grams - it was very rainy and rather cold there), but I
saw only 5 or 7 drunk people, and they were arrested by citizens
themselves and were passed to the police. (The police defended the
White House, but there were only the normal crew - a dozen or two of
policemen).
        There were several buses with food and hot (warm) tea but, of
course it wasn't enough for that crow, so most of the people had bags
with food. But nobody was armed. (Hi, Bob, do you remember your
question: you asked what I think about the laws that allow citizens to
be armed? That time I answered that I prefer to be armed at least to
defend myself and my family if the commie try to return their power.
The time proved that I was right).
        About 21.00 we heard that the "committee" imposed a curfew (from
23.00 till 5.00). As far as I saw nobody decided to go away. There were
about 50 000 people around the White House that time.
        At 1.00 am I decided to go away from White House walls and to
look at the situation around. When I came to the barricades on the
Kalinin's prospect, I heard cries that soldiers were coming here. Most
of the people built a line across the street, some (including me) tried
to go forward. After I went 100 meters to the Sadovoye Ring, I heard
several shootings. Since they were somewhere in front of me, I didn't
stop. But then I saw the traces of the tracer bullets above my head, I
had to stop. Yes, guys, I didn't get accustomed to being a target for a
automatic gun bullets! Especially when I saw that they did shoot from
the roof or from the last floor of the house I was standing near. But
the curiosity is stronger than the fright, so I ran forward to the
bridge across the Sadovoye Ring. I was there in five or ten minutes
after one of the tanks was set on fire. So I didn't see myself how
those civilian people were killed, but I heard the eye-witness
accounts.
        So I try to combine my own impressions with these accounts (I'm
hearing the interview now and they spoke the same things). In this
place the Sadovoye Ring (the wide ring road surrounding the center of
Moscow) has a tunnel under the Kalinin prospect. The Ring was crossed
before and after the tunnel. There were several (about 8) water-carrier
cars in front of the tunnel. When the crew of several (six, I think)
light tanks went to the tunnel they were passed: drivers put away
water-carriers, but when tanks entered the tunnel (this tunnel is 30-40
meters long), drivers followed them and crossed the road behind them,
in 10 meters before the tunnel. The exit of the tunnel is a 100-meter
rise with high granite-made walls. The exit of this rise was blocked
with a barricade made of a dozen of trolleybuses (the Ring has 6 lines
here). The first tank tried to cross the barricade, but failed. In this
moment people surrounded this tank and tried to get in contact with the
crew. But the crew began to fire (into the sky). Then people teared
away the tarpaulin from the tank, and covered the tank with the
tarpaulin. The tank crew became blind and they started fire through the
tarpaulin (NOT into the sky). One guy who was on the tank was killed,
then another guy tried to get him away from the tank, but he fell under
the tank tracks. As far as I understood one more man was a victim of a
bullet. When people saw it, they opened cars parked near the Ring, took
empty bottles from people living in the buildings near the tunnel and
began to throw bottles with gas into this tank. Since it wasn't a
special liquid, but only the petroleum, the tank was set on fire only
after the sixth of seventh bottle. The crew of the tank jumped out of
the tank, and ran to other tanks, firing into the sky.
        Then three tanks went back into the tunnel, and two tanks tried
to cross the barricade, but failed and were blocked there. Then the
crew was suggested to leave technique and went away, but they were so
afraid, that only in 3 hours, when the deputies went and promised them
to be intact, the tanks were covered with Afghanistan veterans, Russian
flags were mounted on these tanks and the tanks were directed to the
White House and they had to join the defenders.
        Since we didn't have enough Russian white-blue-red flags, people
used the official commie flag of the Russian republic: the Soviet red
flag with a blue vertical line, but it was a big hole in place of the
commie symbol - the hammer and sickle.

OK, so the first results:

        We haven't heard anything from the CPSU during these days, they
were afraid to support the putschmen openly. But all local committees
that supported putschmen consist of local commie chiefs, so it can't
protect the Communist Party from the responsibility. I hope that these
events made the agony of the CPSU much more fast.

        The Council of Veterans (the right-wing organization, controlled
by generals)  supported the putsch. It is out of law now (Mr.Popov, the
mayor of Moscow closed it today).
        The second channel of TV isn't Soviet any more: the Russian
government asked Gorby VERY politely to give this channel to Russia for
several months. Today Eltsin ordered that now this channel is the
Russian TV channel.
        The Moscow departments of KGB, internal forces and policy should
be passed to control of the Russian government in three days.

        The official Soviet TV surpassed itself today. Only the first TV
channel worked these days, and when I returned home in the morning they
supported the "committee" and told about "a small group of drunk
extremists around the White House". In the afternoon they began to
speak about the "so-called committee". In the evening they asked some
democracy leaders for interviews. Everybody knew that this agency and
the Telegraph agency (TASS) are dirty street-walkers, but today they
surpassed themselves! OK, the chief of the Soviet TV sent in his
resignation. This guy killed the most popular progressive TV programs
during the last months when he was the chief of the Soviet TV. And he
always told that he pursued the policy of Gorbachev and Gorby always
supported him.

The rebellion was supported by:
1)      Saddam Hussein, Kaddafy, Arafat;
2)      The Leader of Liberal-Democracy Party, Girinovskiy (don't look at
the name of the party, he is a regular,100% Nazi, but he got 12% (if
memory serves me well) on last elections).
3)      Some commie leaders of small national republics inside Russia.
I think that all of them are political corpses now.

        And I hope that a lot of political problems that couldn't be
solved here for years, will be solved in the nearest feature.

        Again, the main thing I want to tell you all in the West: don't
trust Gorby!!!
        When we heard that the airplane with putschmen left Moscow all of
us thought about their terminal point: Baghdad? Tripoli? But they flied
to the Crimea, to Gorby! *HE* is their chief!!!

Ok, just now I heard the news:
        Mr.Silaev said: "We brought Gorbachev in Moscow. And we brought
him to his house".
        Mr.Rutskoy said: "Kryuchkov (the KGB chief) is arrested".

P.S. Mr. Persy (bpersy@encore.com) suggested me to crypt my e-mail
messages and send them anonymously. Thanks, Bob, but I'll never do it!
If you are in a wild jungle you should hold to the way to the
civilization and fight against any wild beast that crosses your way, I
like "Maugly", but I don't trust in this story - if one started to howl
as a wolf, he can't stop. And I can't understand why should I be afraid
of anything in MY country?!

        I picked up another expression of stupidity the other day, from a
        disc jockey talking about one of her callers:  "Some people
        shouldn't drink decaf."  Apparently that applies to the
        putschists.  They managed to arrest Gorby, but not Boris, they
        left Gorby his shortwave radio, they didn't manage to shut down
        all the free press or broadcasting, shut off the airport, or even
        nail down all the major troop concentrations around Moscow.
        Furthermore, in the rebellious republics, they did nothing.

        So, this is a quickie and a shorty.  Maybe, if I can ever kill off
        my backlog, there will be more of these.  And how about that
        130-word sentence back up there?
