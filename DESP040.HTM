                Announcement and Explanation of Policy
                           The Move to KS2

   As with all organizations within Digital, we have had a major
workspace problem in the Colorado Springs organizations.  Even with
liberal forecasting, we were not able to predict the growth of the
business accurately.

   We kept this in mind as we started our search for the ideal location
for expansion.  But we had other considerations also.  Digital has a
tradition of placing organizations in anything but traditional
workplaces.  Reference the Mill, Tewksbury, and Sudbury, just to name a
few.  The Colorado groups have not followed this tradition very well.
And as a result, we have felt separated from the company by more than
mere distance.  How can our representatives, when visiting corporate
groups, feel comfortable by saying, "I work in the Colorado Springs
PLANT."

   Think of it. "PLANT".  Just the word alone conjures images of Blue
Suits, JES2, and the like.  This is just not an acceptable position for
us to be in.

   Therefore, the move will be much more comprehensive than originally
anticipated.

   We have just completed major negotiations with a local real estate
development firm.  We outlined for them Digital's needs, and its
traditions.  We voiced the need to remain in line with the
corporation.  And we  pointed out the need to be unique, yet the same.

   This was obviously a tough order.  But our real estate firm came
through.  The location we have chosen is exactly what we need.  It
reflects the original go-for-it attitude of Digital, while retaining our
own unique Colorado flavor.

   And, finally, for the announcement.  As of June 1st, 1983, the entire
Digital force in Colorado Springs will move to the old Johnston Coal
Mine, located 200 feet below the Cragmoor residential area.

   The area is perfect.  It has plenty of space.  As a matter of fact,
we don't know exactly how much space it has.  Old Skinner Johnston,
owner of the mine, never learned how to write.  But back in 1854, there
wasn't much need for record keeping.  But from what  we have surveyed,
there is enough room for operations until well into 1986.

   Just think. Now when we travel to corporate headquarters ("The
Mill"), we can hold our heads high, and proclaim "I work in the MINES!"

   We too can write poetic verse about strange unmarked passages;
getting lost in the lower chambers;  being trapped for days, then being
saved by ARS Food Service.

   In the near future, each Digital Employee will be issued a Map of the
Known Mine.  You will also be issued one each hard hat with miner's
lamp, and a Pick for designing your own workspace (Your niche, so to
speak).  And for the first time, Digital Employees will be able to Get a
Piece of the Rock.

Subject: MA BELL AND NSA, LEND ME YOUR EARS

The word that the NSA might be monitoring the net comes as no surprise
to this paranoid. During the Nixon reign, the Justice Department
authorized the Drug Enforcement Agency to perform similiar monitoring
of Bell Long Lines. At that time they were looking for "drug
keywords", both proper and slang terms. As slow as it is, the U.S.
mail, backed by law and sheer volume, is probably the most secure way
to pass information. The DoD, in its security documentation, states
that the mail can be considered more secure than the public phones.
This level of security is only surpassed by courier and encrypted
telecommunications, in decending order.

Subject: Terabit memory system

For any of you Desperados out there drooling over the terabit memory
system described here recently I offer the following information.

I used to work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder,
Colorado, where they presently have one CDC 7600 and one CRAY-1.  The 7600
is being scrapped for another CRAY-1 very soon.  They also have an Ampex
Terabit Memory System (TMS; yes, that acronym does seem to be something
of a curse, doesn't it).  The TMS consists of several drives (8 at last
count) and a rather elaborate controller (an 11/34).  The system is
tape-based, and the tapes they use are broadcast grade 4-inch videotapes!
Yes, friends, they're really DECtapes that have taken growth hormones.  The
tapes have all the advantages of the old DECtapes, like unrecoverable
space when files are deleted, directories kept on the tape, and so on.
The density of information is so high on the tapes that they move at a
snail's pace when reading.  The biggest problem with the operation of
the thing is that if the file you want is on another volume it takes
45 minutes (!) to mount and align the tape.

After I left NCAR I was on an NSF committee to review the NCAR computer
center and we discovered that Ampex only made 3 or 4 of these things.
On top of that there were (two years ago) only 2 left, one at NCAR
and the other somewhere else.  I think that NCAR subsequently bought
the other one for spares.  Ampex no longer supports the beast but NCAR
keeps it going because of the tremendous amount of information it can
hold.

Subject: And this is our Navy!

The following is a true story overheard in TW:

A fresh young Navy Lieutenant arrived at Quonset Point Naval Air Station and
was eager to fly the antisub warfare trainer.  This guy was sharp - he didn't
miss anything; even noted that the oil pressure was 5 pounds low (on a gauge
about an inch in diameter).  Trainer operator said that was okay, the gauge
was AFU.  Anyway, this looie was a Really Alert Guy.  He finished a textbook
runup and then turned to the operator, saying, "How do I take this thing
off?"  The answer was that he should advance the mixtures and throttles,
release the brake, and accelerate to 90 knots, then pull back on the wheel.
His next words were a surprised, "Oh - it's just like the airplane!"

Yeah, it's just like the airplane, SIR...

Sleep well, America, you're well guarded.  "Antisubmarine warfare is our
nation's first line of defense."  (US Navy propaganda slogan)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Also old, possibly true, story about navigation system that turned the
plane upside down when it crossed the equator, discovered on Trainer
before test-flown.

All those chocolate recipes were fine and dandy, but there are some of

is interested, who does hand-made gourmet chocolates (truffles and such --
they even come in hand-stencilled boxes).  I'll be happy to pass the
information on to anyone who wants it (send mail to ALIEN::BEING::RILEY).

The previous comment is also an example of using a comma before the word

The sources to EMPIRE may be found in KIRK::DB2:[EMPIRE].  It's written
in FORTRAN, and this version is suitable for compiling and running under

version is usable on a VT125 with a color monitor (and maybe on a GIGI,
but I don't remember for certain).

Speaking of magtape, Clark d'Elia once reeled out an entire 2400-foot
roll and measured it by hand so he could prove to the SDC that the
tape was not too short.

Subj:   Who said software engineers have no sense of humor?

Some quotes from the 'Component Software Product Specification for VAX-11
LYDIA Version 1.0' (thank goodness, someone still has a sense of humor):

        Data Administrator - like the Buddha, he is part of the world,
        but apart. Greater than programmer, analyst, even DBA, he has
        achieved enlightenment on the nature of DATA. His vision earned
        him a place in the ranks of Vice-Presidents, although no one
        eles recognizes it yet. His mantra, 'data is a corporate resource',
        gives him power. LYDIA lets him pour shining data items through
        his fingers in a golden stream, increasing his budget and
        chance of corporate success....

        The term 'thing' is used in this specification to mean a person,
        event, condition, concept or thing (sorry) external to the
        dictionary....

        Lydia includes three interfaces to the database: ...

        The interactive mumbldy interface.... The problems this interface
        should solve are:
                Keyword - I know what I want to do, but I don't know
                how you want me to say it.
                Stage fright - the screen goes blank and so does my mind.
                Attribute disphasia (sic) - I want the whatchamacallit,
                the third whatchamacallit.

And, for truth in advertising:

        The CLASSES class is a class of classes. That's recursive and
        confusing. It is, however, useful.
