Since a popular Desperadism is tracing the origins of words and phrases, I
thought I'd see if anyone could shed any light on the phrase "bought the farm"
used as a euphemism for getting killed.  I was at a gathering of friends the
other night where it came up.  I had heard once long ago that it was a phrase
from World War One, the meaning was that your insurance money would pay the
mortgage.  Someone else thought the farm in question was a grave, which would
also make sense since the phrase was originally "bought a farm", and could as
easily be the place you are planted as the place you plant.  Any definitive
answers?  Any new folk etymologies?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I think KIRK::TABER answered the question with the first speculation,
WWI insurance.  I've never heard anyone say "bought a farm" in this
sense.  And how about that signature?  Here in RSXland we have MULP
and JRC$$, but &gt;&gt;&gt;==&gt;PStJTT looks like a prizewinner.

I believe that no one really knows why "Indian summer" is so called, although
theories abound (as you will doubtless find out.)

I also suspect that "Indian giver" refers to the potlatch. The potlatch was
NOT pure eleemosynary giving. It was a display of conspicuous consumption (is
that what Camille had?) and an obligation on the recipient. In fact,
an entire credit economy developed, based on who owed what to whom. For more
details, see one of Peter Farb's books; I think "Man's Rise to Civilization:
The Cultural Ascent of the Indians of North America." is the one.

As for other "Indian _____" phrases, "Indian corn" has been discussed at
length here. When I was a kid, we used the phrase "Indian burn" for a minor
torment involving rubbing ones knuckles vigorously on the anatomy of some
other unfortunate kid. One of the pleasures of moving to New England was
discovering "Indian pudding." The "Indian sign" is given, but I forget why.
(It's not Figure 1.) "Indian pipe" is a plant. There are "Indian clubs" and
"Indian wrestling" for the athletic. Most of these phrases are neutral, not
pejorative.

Mike.

(P.S. Paperback dictionaries are worthless. Neither "potlatch" nor
"eleemosynary" is listed in "The American Heritage Dictionary of the English
Language." Neither word is all that obscure. Moreover, the only "Indian -----"
phrases in there are "Indian summer" and "Indian pipe".)

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Certainly the American Heritage dictionary is worthless.  Is it really
DEC's official dictionary?  No one objected when I insisted on a copy
of Webster's Collegiate.  I've never gotten a satisfactory look-up out
of the American Heritage; the hard-cover is no better than the
paperback, by the way.

Indian clubs are/were also used by "educated", "cultured" gentlemen of the
nineteenth century (which began on January 1, 1801, by the way...) for the
purpose of exercise.  They were swung about in various patterns, ostensibly
to improve the co-ordination (sure would be nice if someone could invent a
way to put an umlaut over the second of two vowels if it is to be pronounced;
the correct spelling of the word immediately preceding this parenthesis is,
C, O, O (with an umlaut, NOT preceded by a hyphen), R, D, I, N, A, T, I, O, N.)
and also to improve the wind and muscle tone.  Indian clubs are moderately
heavy, increasingly so with duration of swinging.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
That ain't no umlaut, that's a dieresis.  It's the same mark, but it
has different meanings in German and English.  The umlaut changes the
pronunciation of the vowel; the dieresis indicates that the two vowels
are in different syllables.  The dieresis over the e is the difference
between Chloe with one syllable and Chlo-e with two.  It also makes
the Blue Oyster Cult, with the dieresis over the O into the Blue
O-Yster Cult.

And, of course, someone *has* invented a way to put it over a letter.
Digital has.  That's what the Compose Character key on the
Professional keyboard is for, combining two keyboard characters.  You
can make a dieresis (or umluat) with the double-quote character.

To continue on my unwarranted discourse:  ALL indians are Asians, not just
the ones that are sometimes referred to as "native Americans".  The archae-
ological world has known for some time now that the soi-disant "native Amer-
icans" are descended from peoples of the Mongoloid race who migrated across
the area now occupied by the Bering Strait sometime ten thousand years or
more ago.  There were other influences at various times, such as the Phoe-
nicians about 2000-1500 B.C., the Celts about 500 to 100 B. C., the Romans
about 200 B.C. to 150 or 200 A.D., the Hebrews about 1000 B.C., the Polyne-
sians at unknown times, and likely others.  The basic stock is, however, of
Asian extraction.

By the bye, I suspec that Indian hemp is indeed cannabis indica.  The US gov-
ernment made attempts to fast-grow cannabis with various rude chemicals dur-
ing World War II, to improve the yield of hemp to make rope.  There are at
present various of these toxic substances around for foolish pot farmers to
buy to get more weed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
But some of the "Indian" expressions, such as India ink, refer to the
people of the Asian subcontinent, while others, such as Indian file,
refer to the North American brand.  And, since you are so well
informed on the subject, what's the difference between Indians and
Eskimos?

Here is the entry from the OED:

        A period of calm, dry, mild weather with hazy atmosphere, occuring
        in the late autumn in the Northern United States.
        (The name is generally attributed to the fact that the region in
        which the meteorological conditions in question were originally
        noticed was still occupied by the Indians; but other more specific
        explanations have been essayed.  In its origin in appears to have
        had nothing to do with the glowing autumnal tints of the foliage,
        with which it is sometimes associated.  The actual time of its
        occurence and the character of the weather appear also to vary for
        different regions; see the quotes.

I won't include the quotes - there are 11 of them, dating from 1794 to 1899.

In conclusion:  The OED I checked in - the Compact Edition of the 1933 full
OED - clearly implies that "Indian summer" is a term that is fairly specific
to a geographical region, and varies in exact meaning even within that
regions.  (This is clear from the quotes given.)  If the term is now in
much wider usage, such usage is relatively recent.

The OED, at least, gives no support to the contention in William Safire's
article a couple of Sunday's back that "Indian summer" originally meant
"false summer".  (I assume it was that article that started all this dis-
cussion off, but I haven't seen anyone mention it!)

Subject: DEC vis a vis military VAX's

Re:  Is DEC trying to get into the military market with all the hoopla
     going on about micro VAXes?

    As someone who used to work for an outfit involved with the Military
Computer Family (MCF) program and mil systems in general,  I thought I'd
throw in a few observations made from the sidelines.

    The MCF program was intended to tackle the problem the DoD has of
having 43 "standard" computer types and 29 "standard" languages in the
field (some of them literally in fields), by specifying 1 standard arch-
tecture and 1 standard language.  More than likely, the MCF program will
result in having 44 standard architectures and 30 standard languages.

    Owing somewhat to the romancing of the DoD by Jean IchBiah (flamboyant
French guy from Honeywell-Bull), ADA was chosen as the standard high level
language in an unusual display of cooperation between the Army, Navy, and
Air Force.  The architecture selection did not go as well.

    A study of various existing architectures from IBM, DEC, Honeywell,
Sperry-Univac, et al was conducted, and the VAX architecture was picked
as most suitable for what the DoD had in mind.  Looks good for us, right?
Well, the story we guys in the trenches got was that the terms by which
the DoD would have bought the VAX architecture would mean that the government
owned it, thus putting it in the public domain, thus meaning anyone could
build the beast without any blessing from DEC.  DEC said "no thanks", and
the search was on for another architecture.

    Since the sores of NIH  were still itching from the VAX selection,  the
Army guys at CORADCOM (Ft. Monmouth, NJ) saw this as their big chance to be
system designers,  and did so in the approved DoD fashion:  they contracted
it out. The result was MIL-STD-1862, affectionately known as Nebula, a VAX-
ish architecture spec'd by a couple of smart CMU grad students.

    Since the Navy had already had the UYK-43 and UYK-44 under development to
replace their UYK-7's and UYK-20's (a mainframe and a mini built by Univac),
they said fooey to the Army and set sail in their own direction.  (UYK is pro-
nounced "Yuk", and is military lingo for computer;  similarly, an SPY is a
multifunction shipboard radar, and an ALQ is an ECM pod.  Got it? ).  I think
the UYK-43 and 44 have since been canned. (The UYK-20 is a strange machine:
how many minis do you know that have a hyperbolic cosecant instruction?).

    Similarly, the Air Force revived their push for the MIL-STD-1750 machine
(a lot like a Z8000) and went their own way into the wild blue yonder (Delco
now produces a 1750 machine: others are developing smaller ones).

    Anyway, the Army went ahead and put out RFP's for two Nebula machines to
meet the following specs:

                                 The AN/UYK-41,          The AN/UYK-49,
                                 also known as           also known as

Environmental requirements  (Compare this to 780's which seem to have an oper-
     ating range of about 70 degrees to 71 degrees F.) on a good day:

     The mini shall be able to withstand lightning striking any cable attached
     to it.  (It is expected that the cable is destroyed,  but the mini should
     keep on crankin').   It's also supposed to function while immersed in two
     feet of salt water,  or frozen in ice,  and meet the TEMPEST requirements
     (a strict radiated emissions standard).
     The micro requirements  are a little looser since it's intended to be im-
     bedded in other equipments.

Ten companies lined up to collect  6 million  clams each to build an advanced
development model of a Nebula machine, including IBM, RCA, GE-TRW (as a team),
Sperry-Univac, Raytheon, and Norden to name a few.  The last I heard was that
everybody but RCA and GE-TRW have dropped out of the competition. The two re-
maing contenders are both proposing CMOS/SOS systems.  The future of the pro-
gram is "iffy":  Some people that I worked with on the MCF program have since
joined a group opposing the MCF program as a waste of resources, arguing that
left to its own devices,   the  industry  will come up with a suitable system
developed without the whole nine yards (sorry, it slipped out)  of government
intervention.

    Will DEC ever get into the military  business?   There's evidently no ob-
jection from the potential customers.  PDP-11's have been popular for quite a
while within the  defense  industry,   but  took the form of in-house micro's
rolled from  2901's  and/or custom chips emulating PDP-11 type architectures.
I've seen many combat systems evolve based on the Nova (sometimes reluctantly
so) because there's a ruggedized Nova available.  For quite a while, ROLM has
been making Nova-compatible systems that could double as wrecking balls.  The
payoffs to DG are obvious: development is usually done on a cheap Nova rather
than an expensive ROLM.  Only recently have PDP-11's become available for use
in the field, with rugged PDP's being produced by Norden (AN/UYK-42 = PDP-11)
and EMM.

    Meanwhile, Raytheon in Sudbury is developing a mil VAX under license from
DEC (using Micro-2, and other tools supplied by DEC),  and  Norden Systems is
also developing a Mil-VAX.   While some companies build only military systems
(e.g. Norden),  some are comfortable with both commercial and mil  (e.g. CDC,
Univac), it seems as if DEC, like DG, is interested in having the DoD use our
stuff, as long as someone else builds it.    I assume it's because the powers
that be decided that the burden on our resources is not worth the payoff from
making the stuff ourselves.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Ken Olsen has always explained DEC's reluctance to take on government
contracts with the line: "We started this company with the unusual
idea of making money."  The implication is that cost-plus contracts
are no way to make money, particularly with the government looking
over your shoulder all the time.

The ruggedized PDP-11s that Norden makes are really funky looking.

I used to work there, in VM/370-CMS land. CMS, the Cambridge Monitor
System, originated in the Cambridge Scientific Center, an IBM THINK
tank (a la Dave Cutler).  This was prior to 1972 when I arrived on the
scene as a technical writer rescued from Poughkeepsie, NY.  The scene
when I arrived was occurring in Burlington, MA very near the mall.
The Control Program (formerly CP/67) and CMS were then called VM/370
and CMS had been renamed the Conversational Monitor System.

VM/370 was a virtual-machine/virtual-memory system.  As such it
allowed program development, interactive applications, batch, and a
method of multi-tasking/multi-using.  It had all the bells and
whistles and the whole nine yards (hooray, I got to use it!). However,
to my knowledge, it could not be used for real-time applications such
as process control, etc.  But it may have been used that way.  Another
interesting feature was that VM/370 allowed you to run ANOTHER
OPERATING SYSTEM, such as OS/370, under control of the Control
Program. VM/370 could, in this cleverly programmed manner, run itself!
In fact,  running operating systems could be "nested."  So you could
have, for example, VM/370 running VM/370, which in turn ran OS. This
wonderfully complicated arragement allowed bringing up new versions of
VM/370 or other operating systems on a currently running system.  It
also allowed sysgens, testing, etc. without endangering (too much) the
Mother VM/370 system.  Sometimes interesting complications developed
(beastly bugs).

In 1976, the whole programming center was told that it had to move to
Poughkeepsie, NY.  This caused much consternation in the ranks and
many people left, including the center manager. Poughkeepsie is not,
for many folks, a hip town.  It died when railroads superseded Hudson
river sloops.  It never quite made it back.  The exodus probably set
back development for an expensive period.  Many of the exodees
enlisted at DEC.  Some of those are fairly well known here.

Subject: RE: #1004: Snow before Christmas

As I page through #1004, I continue to find things that pique my desire to
splash my own opinions about the net.  One of my own favourite misspellings
is that of 'supersede', which variously appears as 'supercede' or 'superceed',
neither of which is to be confused with 'preceed', which is itself an erro-
neous spelling of 'precede'.  Of course, there is always the classic of all
time, 'mispell'.

Since I rarely drink Coke, refuse to drink Tab, and will probably
never ever drink Diet Coke, I can't enlighten anyone on the
differences, but in the spirit of equal-time-for-all-viewpoints, I
would like to pass on the information that Pepsi Free (the new
decaffeinated Pepsi) tastes about 99% like the real stuff (which I
happen to think is pretty good).  It just has a little less "kick" to
it.

SUBJ: Christmas Deferment

The overall problems caused by current business conditions
require that we continue to control our expenses. This includes
delaying Christmas for a further quarter.

Christmas is now scheduled to fall at the end of Q4 FY 83,
instead of the normal period at the end of Q2. All presents
received before that time must remain unopened in the interim
period.

Subj:   Cost Containment

In view of the deepening economic recession worldwide, the Operations
Committe has initiated a policy review of the Cost Containment review
policy situation.  This situation will be subject to an ongoing review.

As a result of this policy the following measures are announced with
immediate effect:

The electricity supply to all buildings will be disconnected. Staff
should collect candles from Reception and adapt their anglepoise lamps
as multi-position candlesticks.

Power to the computers will be generated via a treadmill. All staff will
take hour-long shifts on this at three-hour intervals, except those
exempted by a certificate from their medical practitioner. This is also
expected to obviate the need for heating.

The Sports &amp; Social Club will negotiate favourable rates at Oxfam shops.

The urinals will be plumbed directly to the drinks machines. This is
expected to provide an improvement in quality and the cost will be held
at 3p per cup.

(Oh, and if you could let us have the keyrings back to be melted down,
we'd be very grateful!)
