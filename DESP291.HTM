        Big Day in Harlem

        Upside Your Head! Rhythm and Blues on Central Avenue

                                  =*=

 Back in 1958, then boy photographer Art Kane gathered five dozen jazz
 musicians on a stoop in Harlem and took their picture for Esquire
 magazine.  Last year they made a movie of it.  See it.  If you
 despair of the human race, you may recant from the wonder of the
 humans gathered there, or you may conclude that such giants will
 never walk the earth again again.

 The movie is simple.  Sources:

        All the shots made by Kane, the official photographer, panned
        over and over, different versions sequenced as if stills from
        a movie.

        Photographs made by the participants, notably by Milt Hinton,
        who played bass on a thousand sessions and photographed most
        of them.

        An 8mm color home movie shot that morning by Hinton's wife.

        Documentary footage of these cats playing -- and believe me,
        Lester Young, Thelonius Monk, Willie the Lion Smith, Henry Red
        Allen, Lester Young were genuine cats -- much of it taken from
        the CBS Sound of Jazz special, the television equivalent of
        the Esquire photo, done around the same time.

        And finally, contemporary footage of the subjects of the photo
        looking at it and talking about it.

        Lucky Roberts, Gerry Mulligan, Bud Freeman, Art Blakey, Art
        Farmer, Count Basie, Vic Dickenson, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny
        Golson, Pee Wee Russell, Rex Stewart, Roy Eldridge . . .

 But, you don't like jazz and you never heard of these people.  Don't
 worry, you'll like this jazz and you'll like these people.

 Johnny Otis was born Greek, but was "black by persuasion".  Upside
 Your Head! is his memoir of his life as a musician, first as a kid
 hanging around the nightclubs of LA, then as a drummer in the
 legendary black territory bands -- Harlan Leonard's Kansas City
 Rockets, for one -- and finally as a founder of rock&amp;roll, the one
 white man in America who can talk about the black people as "my
 people" without the slightest affectation.

 An interchange on the band bus:

        "Hey, Blythewood, you got the paper?"

        "Yeah," Blythewood would answer.

        "What's Hitler doing?"

        "Same ole shit."

        "That's all?"

        "Well, here's something?"

        "What's that?"

        "White folks is still in the lead."

 Another selection:

        During a recent road trip with my show, a poignant remark by
        one of the old-timers brought on a mood that can only be
        described as mourning.  As the bus rolled through the Midwest
        on a clear summer night, the air was full of reminiscence.  We
        older guys were recalling the good old days, and the young
        singers and musicians of the group were listening.  Bull Moose
        Jackson, Preston Love, Freddy Clark, Clora Bryant and I each
        offered a memory or an anecdote.  Veteran trombonist John
        "Streamline" Ewing hadn't said much up to this point, but now,
        from the dim area in the rear of the bus, we heard him say in a
        melancholy tone, "We had it all to ourselves."

        The happy conversation died, and it became very quiet.  You
        could cut the feeling of dismay in the air with a knife.  An
        old wound had been opened among the older musicians.  The
        youngsters sat quietly, not quite understanding what all the
        anguish was about but sensing that something heavy had snuffed
        out the jubilant mood.  The following day, my son Nicky, who
        plays drums in the band, remarked, "Damn, Dad, I never felt it
        so quiet and so sad on the bus.  What was that all about?"

        It was about several things.  To begin with, it was about the
        pensive mood of oldsters when they reflect upon the loss of
        thier youth.  There was also the sense of loss at the passing
        of a golden age.  Byut the deeper and more pervasive source of
        the pain was the knowledte that racism was the primary factor
        in the deterioration of African American culture and, mourn as
        we may, that we are powerless to undo the damage.  The silence
        and sadness that night was finally about bewilderment
        . . . How, with things seeming to be moving in the right
        direction as they were in the forties and fifties, could we
        lose it all so completely?

------- start of forwarded message (RFC 934 encapsulation) -------

I have been using some 4mm tapes that hold 4 GB each.  These measure
about 2"x3"x1/2" when in their box. A station wagon could easily hold
on the order of 36,000 of these (a stack 3 ft. high by 5 ft. wide by 4
ft. deep). T   Shakespeare says:  hat would make about 144,000 GB in the station wagon.  If
it takes 6 hours to drive it to New Jersey [from Andover, Mass.] the
equivalent bandwidth would be 6.67 Gb/sec!!  Beats most networks I
know of.  (Even if it took a week that would be ~250 Mb/s....)

Subject: Every word, every sentence

Tom --

I recently came across this tidbit:

        For we may rest assured that, whenever we express ourselves ill,
        there is, besides the mismanagement of language, for the most part
        some mistake in our manner of conceiving the subject.  Embarrassed,
        obscure and feeble sentences are generally, if not always, the
        result of embarrassed, obscure and feeble thought.  Thought and
        language act and react upon each other mutually.  Logic and
        rhetoric have here, as in many other cases, a strict connection;
        and he that is learning to arrange his sentences with accuracy and
        order is learning, at the same time, to think with accuracy and
        order....

Hugh Blair in "Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres", Glasgow 1783.

E.B.White would certainly agree with that, and I thought you'd like it.

Re:  TWEAKING SAMUEL BECKETT

Not that Beckett didn't leave himself open for that tweak, and it's entirely
possible that I am a bad editor (and editing is what I do for a living), but
I occasionally find some value in words used as intensifiers, and also in
the notion that a prose sentence should have rhythm and a lilt.

best regards,

 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

 Why yes, Santo Brian, but if Beckett agreed with you, why then did he
 say what he did?  "Every word is an unnecessary stain on silence and
 nothingness" is the quote.  I think it lilts better without the
 "unnecessary", but it took me ten years of staring at it on my
 bedroom mirror to work it out.  The 3x5 card I typed it on is
 stained, by the way.

 And I don't buy the theory of the "neccessary stain" that one of the
 lost correspondents offered, unless microscope slides are being prepared.

Subject: Tweaking the greats

Tom --

Okay, it takes a lot to get me to write something.  (As you know, it
takes virtually nothing to get me to _say_ something, but that's another
letter.)  "Tweaking Beckett" twok me...or, as a teacher of mine used to
say at the drop of a pencil, that reminds me of a story.

A long time ago, I was regularly engaged in the practice of putting out a
weekly college newspaper.  Being the insufferable freshman I was, I was
always opening my mouth to suggest, complain, protest, or, sometimes, tweak.
Being the learned seniors they were, the editors generally whacked me on
the head and sent me back to pasting down strips of copy (this was back when
one actually had to paste down strips of typeset copy, so as the reader can
tell, this was oh-so-long ago).

One week, the learned senior editorialist penned a screed (I think that
screeds must always be penned, never merely written) complaining that the
fall semester
was far too short in length, compared with the spring semester.  There were
only seven days difference between the two; nevertheless, that lost week led
the writer to borrow from Hobbes and headline the editorial:

        "Short, Nasty, and Brutish"

Unlike the learned senior, I hadn't yet been exposed to Hobbes, and
so I thought the senior wondrously clever, or at the least, possessed of
a fine ear for the rhythms of speech.  It was, thus, with considerable
horror that, in later years, I came upon Hobbes' original:

        No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all,
        continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of
        man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

Now when you put it that way, of course, ending with the tympanic "short"
is perfect.  But as I though more on this, I realized that the editorialist
has actually improved the rhythm of the three-word fragment.  And so have
all of us (or rather, society assembled), as we either change word order,
substitute different words, or even sometimes alter meaning.

My friend Louise has made it clear that she considers such revisionism
sacrilege, but then, she gets upset when she finds that a title of a book
is actually a fragment of a quotation.  She thinks that anyone smart enough
to write a book shouldn't have trouble thinking up something original...but
that's Louise.  I imagine that among your far-flung readers are those who
have the chutzpah to mess with the masters, and I wonder if anyone can come up
with examples of "improvements" upon original quotations.

It might wear better than numbers with lots of zeroes.

Cheers.

 LILIES, PAINTED or GILDED

 Everybody but Shakespeare says: "That's gilding the lily."
 Shakespeare says: "To gild refin'd gold, to paint the lily, to
 throw a perfume on the violet, to smooth the ice, or add another hue
 unto the rainbow, or with taper-light to seek the beauteous eye of
 heaven to garnish, is wasteful and ridiculous excess."

 If, for a baby beauty contest a pretty little 3-year-old girl is
 given a permanent, lipstick, rouge and eye makeup, dressed in
 cascades of starched lace, shod in little heels and stockings, and
 topped off with a tiara, you might call it gilding the lily.

 Are you obliged to quote Shakespeare correctly?  Shakespeare has
 certainly expressed "wasteful and ridiculous excess" better
 than you have.  Further, you have committed the very crime he
 decries, you have edited Shakespeare to improve him.  Any curmudgeon
 or purist who hears you is going to wince and complain, if not to
 your face, behind your back.  Things are not looking good for you.
 Gilding gold, painting the lily, perfuming the violet, are foolish
 attempts to improve on nature, and even without Shakespeare's
 authority any one of these might be a clever figure of speech.

 Gilding the lily is not so fine as any of these.  But for all his
 fineness, Shakespeare is not really talking about what you are
 talking about when you recoil in horror at the sight of a little girl
 done up like Dolly Parton.  Shakespeare's images are in service to
 the plot.  Who can forget that the king was being crowned again when
 he had never legitimately lost his crown in the first place (assuming
 you agree about the affair involving Pope Innocent III)?

 Your image is about the tackiness of the thought that the most
 beautiful thing can be improved by gilding it because is not gold the
 most beautiful of all?  The folk have mined Shakespeare's play - King
 John, as you perfectly well knew - to create a new figure to say
 something different.  And, if you said that the parents of the
 exemplary child were perfuming violets, or lighting the noon sky with
 a candle, or painting the lily, or gilding refin'd gold, you would be
 confusing your listener, by replacing a common expression meaning
 "making something beautiful into something tacky" with an obscure
 literary expression meaning "unnecessary".
