        San Francisco had a referendum last month on the First Amendment.
        It won, you'll be glad to know.  One of the groups supporting the
        amendment wrote, "We have the right to take part in orgies, but
        not videotape them."  I love Constitutional law.

        Christmas shopping at the mall, and boy was it quiet, I overheard
        a lady say to her husband, very calmly, without any undue
        emphases, "No, you're wrong.  It isn't our den.  It's my room."

        Delightful reading of the month, "Southern Reader" (Hey!  That's
        me all over!), two big articles under the heading "Elvis:
        Suspicious Minds Want to Know!".

        First is "Camp Elvis: Totem and Taboo, Hawaiian Style", an attempt
        to rescue the King's movies from those cranks who find them
        shallow and cheap and not particularly representative of the
        volcanic force of the King by making the good old
        deconstructionist, post-modern argument that they are ironic:
        "Like tropical fruit punch, five percent juice and ninety-five
        percent water, 'Paradise Hawaiian Style' does not pretend for a
        mement to offer any real, fresh-squeezed paradise.  Instead, with
        a qualification that perfectly toes a fine line between parody and
        self-parody, stylized artifice and just plain bad imitation,
        'Paradise Hawaiian Style' relishes its own artificiality -- its
        'tackiness' in [Greil] Marcus's words -- without being cynical or
        smug."  Et cetera.

        Then there's Marcus himself, in "Elvis Without Music", in which
        the quotes are better than the article.

        Such as:  "There was always something supernatural about him.
        Elvis was a force of nature.  Other than that he was just a t2d.
        A big dumb hillbilly a couple points smarter than his mule who
        wandered out from behind his plow one day to cut a record for his
        sainted mother and never came back, which he probably woulda
        forgot to do evin if he hadnt've been whisked up.  Why shouldn't
        one physical corpus be capable of containing these two seeming
        polarities simultaneously?  Especially if it's from outer space,"
        opined Lester Bangs.

        And, "He wanted to be an example to young people.  People say
        because later on it was found that he had used drugs, that
        therefore he could not be a good example.  They opverlooked the
        fact that he never used illegal drugs.  It was always drugs
        prescribed by his physician," recorded Richard Nixon for his
        Presidential Library.  Perhaps this was a point Nixon understood
        well.

        And, "Thank you, without you I'm nothing, thank you, too, without
        you I'm nothing,  I love you, thank you, without you I'm nothing,
        I love, thank you, too, without you, I'm nothing, I love you, too,
        Elvis -- without Elvis you're nothing," as Madonna put it, closing
        out the "Blond Ambition" tour, kissing the cast and crew goodbye
        as they dropped through trapdoors one by one.

        And, in the end, "Three weeks of extensive investigation have
        uncovered a dramatic answer to the riddle, 'WHO MURDERED J.F.K?'
        There's a sensational link between the death of Elvis Presley and
        that of the president.  Elvis was murdered by assassins who wanted
        to create a crackpot network of people who believed that he was
        still alive.  Why?  Because then the people who think Elvis is
        still alive would make the Kennedy conspiracy buffs look like
        crackpots, too.  Any new evidence suggesting that Lee Harvey
        Oswald didn't act alone could be belittled with 'Oh yeah.  And
        Elvis is working at a Burger King in Fremont.  Right.'  And there
        are astonishing similarities between the death of Elvis and the
        death of the president.  Elvis died on the toilet.  Kennedy died
        in Dallas.  Kennedy had a secretary named 'Lincoln.'  Presley's
        manager was named 'Colonel.'  There were 'colonels' during the
        Civil War -- a war run by 'Lincoln.'  Kennedy died in 1963;
        Presely in 1977.  Both numbers have four digits.  Ed Sullivan shot
        Elvis from the wiast up.  Kennedy was shot from the head down," as
        some guy said on the radio once.

                                    =*=

        The Southern Reader also quotes Lingua Franca quoting Kurdish
        proverbs:

                - Poverty is like a shirt of fire.

                - Be arrogant in exile and f2t in the desert.

                - A one-faced pig is better than a two-faced man.

                - He who depends on his neighbors will sleep without
                  supper.

                - I would rather God took my life than ask my son-in-law
                  for clothes.

                - A child may give pain but is never boring.

UPI -
HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN NATURE'S FIRST LAW

        In a decision sure to cause major controversy for several minutes,
the US Supreme Court struck down the First Law of Nature, judging it to be
unlawfully discriminatory.

        Though never actually written down, the First Law of Nature is
generally accepted by the American Bar Association to be, "If an individual
or collection of individuals puts into practice or causes to be put into
practice an action which, measured against the judgement of a reasonable
person, is unwise or lacking in basic common sense, then the aforementioned
individual or collection of individuals shall suffer all consequences
resulting from that action, up to and including loss of life."

        Translation:  "You do something stupid, you die."

        In a ruling handed down yesterday, George Bush's Supreme Court
ruled that such a law was too vague and unfairly discriminatory.  Justice
Rhenquist, author of the decision, wrote, "The terms 'unwise' and 'basic
common sense' are never defined anywhere, and are left to the
interpretation of the presiding judge....[which could lead] to mutiple
standards of justice." The court also felt that the penalty was too vaguely
defined and too harsh.  Writes Rhenquist, "It is theoretically possible for
an individual to lose his/her life by, for example, sticking their tongue
across a 120 volt outlet.  While such an action would clearly demand
explanation from the individual attempting it, it is not Our [sic] opinion
that such an action warrants the penalty of death, particularly if the
outlet in question lacks a label warning of such practice..."

        In striking down the First Law, the Court also mandated that steps
be taken to correct the discrimination the law imposed.  Affirmative Action
has already drafted a set of standards.  Though not final, the suggestions
include:

        o Requiring employers to hire a set percentage quota of stupid
          people (most employers with union contracts already meet the
          proposed standard),

        o Requiring all non-profit organizations receiving public funds (PBS,
          National Endowment for the Arts, et al) to spend a set percentage
          of those funds promoting stupidity (the NEA, based on recent
          censorship mandates, already qualifies),

        o Equal time for the views of the stupid on national issues,

        o A constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on
          stupidity, and

        o A national TV and press campaign to raise the nation's awareness
          of the plight of stupid people (the draft suggests the slogan,
          "Stupid Is Beautifull [sic]").

        When interviewed, Dan Quayle said, "It's the most significant step
forward this country has taken since Neil Diamond set foot on the moon."

                         THE DEVIL'S BOOK OF QUOTATIONS

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        I have a collection of wise sayings, mostly unattributed, but
        from all the usual sources, Bible, Shakespeare, Dorothy Parker,
        Spanish proverbs.  I started it long ago.  It was going to be
        sort of a Devil's Book of Quootation to stand alongside Ambrose
        Bierce's Devil's Dictionary.  A stupid mind is the Devil's
        playground..

        A wise man knows the fool, but the fool knows not the wise man.

        Everything which is created by intelligence alone is false.

        A pound of melancholy will not pay an ounce of debts.

        In addition to a very small number of truly new phenomena, every
        world and every era contains an incalculably large number of
        repetitions, modifications, and paradoxes.

        Prepare for the unexpected.

        It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search for their
        own glory is not glory.

        Against stupidity, the very gods themselves contend in vain.
                                                -- Schiller

        Sow the wind and reap the harricane.

        As snow in the summer and as rain in the harvest, so honor is not
        seemly for a fool.

        The self is a circle whose center is everywhere and whose
        circumference is nowhere.

        A willful man should be very wise.

        As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool to his folly.

&gt; There is an official State of New Hampshire highway sign...

Not all of New Hampshire is so egalitarian.In Northwood, on the main
highway from Concord to Portsmouth, there is a sign that towers over a
grocery store parking lot that says, in 4-foot high letters:

               LIVE FREE OR DIE

and beneath it, in 10-inch high letters:

            Northwood Residents Only

Free-associating, the somewhat shabby shpping plaza near me in
Bridgewater, Nova Scotia had, until recently, several little
hand-painted signs announcing that:

           Loiters will be Prosecuted

which was never a problem, since I was never tempted to loit in such a
depressing plce anyhow.

Subj:   auctioning off Lenin's corpse....

Re: the following item in Desperado #3055:

&gt;       As if that weren't enough, the Russian Republic is proposing to
&gt;       auction off Lenin's corpse, long a major tourist attraction in
&gt;       Red Square, to raise money.  They think they can get $17 million
&gt;       for it.  They wouldn't get that much from me.  Divide that figure
&gt;       by 100,000,000 to arrive at my bid.

Apparently, this is a hoax perpetrated by a magazine called "Forbes FYI",
a very fluffy "lifestyle" quarterly supplement to Forbes magazine.  It must
be for those millionaire subscribers Forbes keeps bragging about, because
it sure ain't aimed at me.

Anyway, one morning in mid-November, I heard on NPR's Morning Edition as I
was waking up a story relating how the Soviet Foreign Ministry was very
angry about stories in the press indicating that Lenin's corpse was for
sale.  They stated that the story was completely false.  It seems that the
story was picked up by AP and run unchecked in a number of papers in the US
(not surprising, 'cause it's a good story).  The NPR story went on to
interview FYI's editor, Christopher Forbes, who thought the whole thing
very funny, and wondered about the absence of a sense of humor on the part
of the other editors who ran the story in their publications.  All in all,
a very funny tempest in a teapot.

For those who are interested, the story does appear in FYI, the November
25, 1991 issue, page 25.  Accompanying the story is a photo montage of
Lenin's corpse, in a plexiglass box, with a rose-in-vase and an ice bucket
complete with champagne on top, with two couples behind in formal dress
standing around trying to look like they're having a good time.

The last three paragraphs of the story are:

"A condition of the sale is that the Lenin corpse not be used for any
"commercial, or improper" purpose, the deed of purchase to be administered
by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, in the Netherlands,
making the conditions of sale enforceable by that international legal
community.

"Description:  Mr. Lenin's body was embalmed at his death in 1924, and
stored in a sealed, climate-controlled glass casket.  (Shades of Sleeping
Beauty!)  It has been periodically re-embalmed.  Every five to ten years,
the skin, somewhat yellowed but by no means jaundiced-looking, requires a
special application of preservative, or "waxing."  Under the terms of sale,
maintenance is to be provided only by qualified Russian mortuary
specialists from the Interior Ministry, expenses to be paid for by the
purchaser.  (Estimated annual upkeep:  $10,000-$15,000, varies with
climate.)

"Obviously, the Lenin corpse is not for everyone.  But as a conversation
piece, it would certainly have no equal.  You might have some explaining to
do to the lady of the home, but the item is fairly compact and could be
accommodated to fit in most large dens."

How long before magazines and newspapers start feeling the need to put
those silly smiley faces [;-)] on their satire?

Subj:   Bring me the head of Albert Einstein

I recall reading about Einstein's brain perhaps 20 years ago.  Scientists
really did want to examine the brain of the most celebrated scientist of
the 20th century to determine what was different about it.  In this respect
they were no different from the KGBers.

They discovered that it was only average in size thereby disproving the
previously assumed correlation between brain size and intelligence (a
theory fostered by someone noting the enormous head/brain size of a
famous English philosopher/mathematician of the 18th/19th centuries;
the name escapes me).

They also discovered that Einstein's brain had many more folds, nooks,
and crannies (the Sharpei effect?) than the average brain.  Some scientists
tried to make a connection between this and high intelligence.  Perhaps
other readers may wish to add this effect to the list of euphemisms for
dull-wittedness.

        This political correctness business is really tough on discourse.
        On the one hand, yay-rah for freedom of speech, on the other
        hand, this is probably despicable (despreciable en Espaqol), but
        on the third hand, its very existence is funny enough to make it
        worth mentioning, and on the fourth hand, the little woman (the
        blonde Mrs. Desperado) has great legs, not that I'd care to have
        them discussed on some worldwide mailing list that goes who knows
        where.

        Contrariwise, maybe pierna-mania isn't despreciable in the
        Iberian peninsula and the stretch from El Paso to Cape Horn.
        According to my book on customs of the Spanish-speaking, it is
        not impolite to stare if you speak Spanish.  Another reason for
        those Spanish lessons.

    Three priests are walking down the beach, when one of them stubs his
    toe on something in the sand.  He digs it out, and lo and behold it's a
    lamp with a cork in the top.  He rubs it, and the cork pops out and
    there springs a genie to life before them.

    The genie says, "OK, each of you gets a wish".

    So the first priest says, "Well I don't really need much in the way of
    worldly wealth, all my needs are met, and I have want for nothing.  But
    if I could ask for anything, I'd ask for twice as much wisdom as I now
    have."

    The genie says, "So be it".  Poof!  The first priest looks happy.

    So the second priest says, "Well, I have no needs either, the church
    has provided for all of my needs.  But I, too, lack wisdom.  Let me have
    five times more wisdom".

    The genie says, "So be it".  Poof!  The second priest looks very happy.

    So the third priest says, "Well, I have a great need for wisdom.
    Please bless me with seven times more wisdom".

    The genie says, "Are you sure? Do you know what you are asking for?"

    And the third priest says, "Yes! Seven times more wisdom".

    The genie says, "So be it".  Poof!  The third priest becomes a woman.

Subj:   Supreme Court

The Supreme Court declined to rule on a case involving permission for
local telephone companies to enter the information (including video)
distribution and publishing businesses.  The American Newspaper Publishers
Association had sought to delay this change in rules.  Speaking for the
Court and explaining its refusal to take the case, Justice Thomas said
that he had no opinion on the issue, that he had never expressed any
opinion on this issue, that he had in fact never used a telephone, or
even seen a telephone, and that he had never thought about newspapers.
Justice Thomas went on to explain at great length that when he grew up
in Pinpoint, Georgia, they had no telephone and did not use newspapers,
not even the editorial page, in their outdoor toilet.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        But seriously, folks, although the newspapers have been beefing
        for at least fifteen years about the horrible advantage that the
        phone system has ove newspapers, there is not one single
        significant instance of newspapers attempting to use the telephone
        lines for these purposes.  The big fear the newspapers have is
        losing the classifieds, but they aren't forestalling the danger in
        any way.  Remember how Marshall McLuhan saved the railroads by
        teaching them that they were in the transportation business, not
        the railroad business?  Well, someone should inform the newspapers
        that they're in the information business.

&gt;  From the Irish Times

                THE CHEQUE IS IN THE POST, NO SWEAT

   The smell of sweat from men's armpits is being used to prduce bills that
   really get up your nose - and are more likely to be paid on time.

   The British company which discovered and patented the technique is offering
   the substance to respectable debt-collection agencies.

   The secret lies in the sweat men produce from their armpits and groins. It
   contains a pheromone called adrostenone, also found in animals,
   which gives off a chemical "aggresion" message.

   Sprayed on to the paper used for bills or mixed in the printer's ink, it can
   have a subconcious effect on the recipient - making him or her more likely
   to pay up, the company says.

   Mr David Chaddock, managing director of Bodywise, which markets the
   substance under the name Aeolus 7, said yesterday : "It's the subconcious
   equivalent of red print. It says: `This letter comes from a person who
   means business, who is not to be messed with'."

   Pheremones are chemical substances animals use for communicating with one
   another, but they are also present in humans.

   Bodywise obtained its patent after setting up a trial in Australia in which
   a firm selling mail-order cosmetics sent out 1,000 bills, half of which were
   treated with Aeolus 7. It was found that 17 per cent more people receiving
   treated bills paid up than those who were sent odour-free bills. - (PA)

                     MARTIN GARDNER "TRICKSTER" CULT SHOCKER

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

From: sanelson@milton.u.washington.edu (S. A. Nelson)
Newsgroups: sci.skeptic
Subject: Is Gardner "Trickster?"
Summary: a Martin Gardner cult in Seattle

        I don't know if any of you guys know about this yet,  but here in
Seattle there is apparently a new new-age group, centered on the person-
ality of Martin Gardner! I couldn't believe it at first, but then I actual-
ly talked to one of them. He is a programmer for the City of Seattle. I
will keep his name secret for obvious reasons. In his spare time, he
participates in seminars at the Greenwood Community Center, well known for
the wide variety of wacky organizations that meet there (the EMIN, for
instance.)

        They meet once a week, meditate, and intently study Gardner's works,
especially "Relativity for the Million." He told me that this will prepare
them for an age in which science will be "obsolete" and "the force of human
will" will allow a closer spiritual empathy with the universe. They publish
a small newsletter "The Light" and plan to have a booth at The Northwest
Psychic Fair.

        I thought this sounded silly and asked him if he was not aware that
Gardner was a secular humanist and a debunker, and utterly hostile to the
type of ideas this group supported. He replied "Well, Martin, he's Trickster,
he's the Coyote. We all collect his columns from 'Skeptical Inquirer.'" Then
he said something about Gardner's "just trying to throw people off." In much
new age material, taken (and much abused) from Native American mythology,
Coyote is a "cosmic trickster," who delights in misleading people for a
deeper spiritual purpose. Apparently these people view Martin Gardner in much
the same light.

        He went on to claim that they received "encouraging letters" from
Gardner himself. I find this _very_ difficult to believe. I have seen the
newsletter and will try to find another copy. Can anyone else shed any
"light" on this peculiar group.

Subj:   Mark your calendars now

    From: jo@odi.com

    According to my almanac, the year 2000 will be the first centenary
    leap year since 1600.  Also the very first recorded millenial leap year.

Righto!  Ah, that Pope Gregory, what a guy.

I picked up some fascinating historical trivia on this subject, mostly
from the back pages of a calendar refill (!).  The Catholic countries of
Europe adopted the Gregorian reforms to the Julian calendar on Gregory's
decree, in 1572.  The Protestant countries held out against it for a
very long time, just because it was a papal initiative, no other reason.
The English-speaking world, including the North American colonies,
didn't adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752, by which time the Julian
calendar had gotten two days further out of whack with the solar year, a
total of 13 days off, I think.  It is almost within my lifetime that the
last stragglers in the third world adopted it (e.g., Turkey in 1930).

There are still a few holdout communities that use the old calendar.
One is the small fishing settlements in the Outer Banks of North
Carolina, which still celebrate "Old Christmas" on about 9 January (NS).

                                       BUT

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

        We still celebrate Christmas on Jesus's birthday and if I'm going
        to get that Christmas issue done this year it will have to be
        immediately, so I'd better stop what I'm doing and go on to the
        next one.

        The new Desperado authoring tool technology is working very well.
        I just natter in my file and then fill out with a couple of yards
        from my pool file.

        I'm convinced the typewriter jugglers 375 lines back will meld
        into one single three-dimensional figure but I just can't get my
        old eyebones to do it.  Maybe if I print it out on paper.
