We seem to be so successful that there is dancing in the streets. As a
result of higher earnings, and big promotions, and general joie de compagnie,
people have been sending me serious stuff. OK! I give up! I know a trend
when my nose is rubbed in one! Avaunt, relentless frivolity!
This issue we get down to cases, and listen to what the press is saying about
DEC and why it can't seem to do anything wrong these days, aim for our toes
as we might. (And deep down, I *am* pleased with
our 138% growth in the 2nd quarter results, or whatever, especially since
at the same time IBM shows a 7% decline!)

Is there a reason why the rest of the world thinks we're in gravy? Is there a
reason why we're enduring straitened cicumstances for the sake of the
front office? Take it away, 4GL::SCHUETZ!

Subj:   K.O. Profile (some new facts) and IBM Layoffs

VNS COMPUTER NEWS:                            [Tracy Talcott, VNS Computer Desk]
==================                            [Nashua, NH, USA                 ]

 An interview with/profile on - K.O.
   "A low key leader in a high tech business, he takes a maverick approach
        that works."
   The most eye catching fixture in Ken Olsen's office is a stuffed beaver
 gnawing away at a tree stump. It befits the workaholic chairman of DEC in his
 crusade to topple IBM.
   Yes, Olsen's a driven man. Saturday, he enters his 30th year atop DEC as a
 godfather of sorts in high technology. A world-class engineer, he still drops
 into company labs on weekends to quiz his researchers. Once he went to a
 retail store, bought a DEC personal computer, and then raised hell about its
 poor quality. Yet, his grandfatherly demeanor and disarming ever present grin
 dispel notions that Mr. Olsen rules with an iron fist.
   Throughout Digital, he's known and addressed as "Ken". Under his direct
 orders, DEC has no reserved parking spaces or company cars; any employee is
 free to use (for business reasons) DEC helicopters. Says Jack Rochester,
 co-author of "The Naked Computer", "Olsen's very much the common man."
   Despite his $755,000 salary, the lanky, 6-foot-2-inch CEO foregoes
 limousine luxury to drive a Ford Escort van. Unlike his High-flying Silicon
 Valley counterparts, Olsen prefers quiet New England values -  no smoking,
 drinking or lavish possessions - to cruising the fast lane. His idea of a
 vacation: quietly paddling a canoe across a Canadian lake.
   "Here's a guy who doesn't know, or care, about his net worth," said Richard
 Gochman, VP of J&amp;W Senligman &amp; Co., an investment firm. "He doesn't wake up in
 the morning and say, 'I'll make another 5 million today.' That's not what
 motivates him."
   What truly excites the 60-year-old  Olsen, practically causing him to leap
 out of his leather backed chair during an 1 1/2 hour interview, is competition
 and making things work.
   "Oh, it's more exciting than it's ever been," he beams in his brick and wood
 trimmed office in a pre-Civil War woolen mill, DEC's birthplace and
 headquarters. "More fun, more things being done. And so effectively, and
 efficient, partly because we use computers."
   DEC is the largest USA manufacturing firm still headed by its
 founder. Olsen is arguably one of, if not *the*, most successful entrepreneurs
 in history. In sheer revenues, neither Henry Ford of Ford Motor Co. nor Edwin
 Land of Polaroid Corp compare.
   Olsen's high-tech bent permeates DEC's  style: The company prohibits
 sales commissions because Olsen considers marketing "just hype" that oversells
 machines. DEC's 1985 annual report contains no photos of  Olsen and features
 an actual - although worthless - fingernail sized computer chip on its all
 black cover.
   "The man is first of all an engineer, above all an engineer, and he runs an
 engineering company," Anderson said.
   A  stickler for efficiency, Olsen once schooled a lunchmate on the
 advantages of breaking oyster crackers inside a plastic bag *before* opening
 them.
   To understand why, consider DEC's (i.e. Olsen's) history:
   In 1957, Olsen was dabbling with the radical notion of creating
 a computer company. He approached Doriot, a Boston venture capitalist, who
 sent Olsen before his  board. First, Doriot warned the 31-year old whiz kid:
 Don't use the word 'computer'. *Fortune* magazine said no one had made any
 money in computers and no one was about to.
   So Olsen told American Research and Development's board that he'd make
 'modules'. Then he promised a 10% return and fast results. ARD invested
 $70,000 and Olsen set up shop, at 25 cents a square foot a year, in the mill.
   There, surrounded by cheap lawn furniture, Olsen printed computer circuits
 with real silk mounted on wood frames. He etched the circuits in aquariums
 from the 5 and 10.
   His 'modules' sold well: DEC eked out a tiny profit its first year.
 Subsequent models (PDP-1 in 1960 and PDP-8 in 1965) launched the computer
 industry into a new era.
   The reason: IBM's room sized mainframes were inaccessible to all but a few
 programmers. Olsen's *mini*-computers could be used by thousands and broke the
 $1 million price barrier.
   Olsen's handiwork created an entirely new, and immense market, and DEC had a
 virtual monopoly. Sales blossomed to $533 million by 1975. And now, 29 years
 hence, Olsen commands the worlds No 2 computer company: an estimated
 $7.7 billion in annual revenues, 91,000 employees and 800,000 computers
 installed.
   Of course, Olsen's engineering-based approach has, on more than one
 occasion, caused DEC some real problems. The Rainbow personal computer in 1982
 was elegantly designed with every sleek engineering feature DEC could think
 of. But, its delayed debut and high price made it a  dismal failure. The
 remarkable thing though, is how Olsen bounces back. A new DEC personal
 computer is on its way.
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   Olsen's thoughts:

   On press criticism: If you believe what you read when people beat you up,
 you can get into serious trouble.

   On staying on top: "this is a business where you never stop. Take a breath
 and somebody's ahead of you."

   On today's glowing press:  "It's scary. The one thing that gets you behind
 is to believe you're pretty good."

   On arch rival IBM: "The other big guy (IBM) is getting criticized right now,
 and he might start working awful hard. I like it a lot better when he's
 contented."

   On being acquired: "We're expensive enough that few are in a position to
 even try. And most companies big enough to acquire us are too smart. They
 know no high-tech takeover has ever succeeded."

   Digital Equipment Corp., continuing to chisel away at industry leader IBM,
 announced Monday a 138% increase in its quarterly profit.
   Digital's performance defied the computer slump and contrasted sharply with
 the results of IBM which two weeks earlier reported a 7.7% decrease in
 second-quarter profit.
   Digital said it earned $238.6 million in its fourth fiscal quarter ended
 June 28, up sharply from a weak $100.4 million a year earlier. Earnings per
 share rose to $1.81 from 83 cents. Revenue rose 17% to $2.17 billion from
 $1.85 billion a year earlier.
   For its full 1986 fiscal year, Digital's earnings rose 38% to $617.4 million
 from $446.7 million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $4.81 from
 $3.71. Revenue rose 14% to $7.59 billion from $6.69 billion.
   Digital's results looked especially good in comparison with its year-earlier
 results, which were depressed by a recession in the minicomputer business. The
 1985 quarter's profits were down 23% from the previous year.
   Analysts said Digital's strong performance this year came from the complete,
 20-month overhaul of its VAX line of minicomputers. All the products in the
 VAX line can run the same programs, something that gives Digital an important
 edge over IBM and some other companies.
   "What we're seeing now is the payoff from an enormous investment and
 disciplined pursuit of a 15-year strategy that has given us a single family of
 truly compatible products," Kenneth Olsen, Digital's president, said in a news
 release.
   Along with improving the VAX computers, Digital made them cheaper to build,
 which is improving profit margins, said Craig Symons, an analyst for the
 Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
   "They had just extraordinary gross profit margins. Best in six years," said
 John Levinson of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   Digital made no mention of the long-lasting slump in the computer industry.
 Customer demand remained firm overseas and strengthened in the United States,
 James Osterhoff, the vice president and chief financial officer, said in the
 news release.
   Symons said Digital is benefiting from pent-up demand from customers who
 waited for its new machines. And, he said, "It's clear that DEC is taking some
 market share from IBM."
   But Symons said even Digital will eventually feel the effect of softness in
 spending on computers. "Nobody's immune to the economy," he said.
   Osterhoff, recruited to Digital from Ford Motor Co.'s tractor division a
 couple years ago, deserves credit for streamlining Digital's finances, Symons
 said. The company noted that its inventories declined for the sixth
 consecutive quarter and its year-end cash position improved from a year ago by
 more than $800 million, to $1.91 billion.

Subj:   Hindle, Shields &amp; Smith promoted to Senior V.P.

DIGITAL NAMES THREE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS
by Jane Meredith Adams, Globe Staff

  From a throng of Digital Equipment Corp. vice presidents, three long-time
employees yesterday rose to the rank of senior vice president, each thought
to be a likely candidate to succeed Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's 60-year-old
president.
  Olsen, who appears in robust health and runs with vigor the Maynard
company he founded, repeatedly has said he will not name a successor any
time soon.  Company policies do not call for him to retire at age 65 and
he has given no indication that he would like to wind down.
  Yesterday's appointments, though, were unusual in that Digital has never
used the title senior vice president before.  The three senior vice pres-
idents, Winston R. Hindle Jr., John J. Shields, and John F Smith, "have all
been there since the beginning," said Adolf F. Monosson, who writes a news-
letter about Digital.  An Olsen successor "is one of those three," he said.
  Monosson said he considered Shields, who is in charge of sales and
services, the front-runner.  Sales and customer service has been important
in Digital's recent success despite a decline in the computer industry,
and will continue to be important, "if they are going to take business
from IBM," said Monosson.
  The senior vice presidents, who were chosen from a field of 43 vice pres-
idents, have seen enormous changes at Digital, from its modest origins to
its growth into the world's second-largest computer company.
  Smith, 51, who is responsible for engineering, manufacturing and product
marketing, joined the company in 1958 when there were 12 employees.
  Shields, 47, joined the company in 1961 as a field service engineer when
there were 100 employees.  And Hindle, 55, who is in charge of corporate
staff functions including purchasing and planning, joined Digital in 1962
as assistant to the president when the company had 400 employees.  The
company now employees 92,000.

I'm just about to celebrate my tenth anniversary with DEC (thanks for the
tie tack, folks. Where are my stock options?) and I have been hearing rumors
about KO's successor for all ten of those years. I'm also getting very
grumped that nobody has asked *me* to be a vice president. My money is
on Shields, for what that's worth, but then I backed the Pats in last
year's Superbowl.

"Electronic mail is getting the stamp of approval from introverts,
according to International Resource Development, a Norwalk, Conn.,
market research firm.  Extroverts with their flair for
face-to-face negotiations and ability to make
deals over the telephone may have had the upper hand, but introverts
with their precisely aimed prose are finding electronic mail a
political weapon.  'What is really at the bottom of this is all
those wimpy accountant-types that were previously resigned to
sublimating their anger are now breaking down the lines of
communications through social and corporate structures with a
few keystrokes,' claims Jean Buffham, an admittedly shy and meek
researcher who helped write International Resource Development's
222-page report on electronic mail."

Oh, tame, very tame! You should try corresponding with writers, whose personal
names include:

     An orgy of spiders on a plateful of ink
     _32 bits is an architecture, not a raise. 138% is a raise.
     Most people aren't writers, and very little harm
          comes to them.

Then there are the almost baroque personal names of a documentation wizard
who shall remain nameless:

     If you create a monster and want to make a bed for him,
          you better make a big bed -- Fred Whipple
     How many people do you think I am? -- David Byrne

Subject: Baby On Board Beat

The following letter appeared in the August issue of Car &amp; Driver magazine:

  It was a light-blue Volvo wagon with a dark interior, sitting in a sunny
parking lot.  As I approached, I noticed the windows were tightly closed.
Sure must be hot in there, I thought.  As I passed the car, a yellow diamond
caught my attention.  My God!  There was a baby on board!  The doors were
locked; I couldn't see the little sucker; he must have collapsed behind the
seat.  I smashed a window and searched the car.  You can imagine my relief
on finding the sign was in error.
  My relief was short-lived, however, as I soon noticed other parked cars
with their windows closed that also warned, "Baby on Board."  No time to
waste, I broke into a run . . .

You might be able to use this logo in Desperado - it comes from David A. Roth,
at Bell Labs.

Subj:   logo

I came up with a logo/process name which should
belong to a member of a crew team, instead of
to my swimmer self.

      \_&amp;_&amp;_&amp;_&amp;_&amp;_/

Despite the fact that one friend insists this depicts
a bowl of chicken soup with malformed matzo balls, I
hold that it's a crew team from the side.   Look at
those folks row!
