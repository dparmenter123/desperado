The following note was sent to the Unix Usenet; you might find it
interesting.  Since it was written, I was drafted to buy a small
amount of chocolate for redistribution.  This ended up totalling
310 pounds -- they didn't have 320 pounds on hand.  After everybody
got there share, I ended up with six pounds, some of which went
into the following:

This week, I took a "chocolate orgy" evening course from The
Cambridge Center for Adult Education.  Here are a few notes
and one recipe.

The best place to buy chocolate is at a professional baker's supply
house (Premier Chocolate Co, 107 No. Washington, Boston was
recommended).  There, you can buy a 10 lb. block of top-quality
chocolate (much better than supermarket stuff) for $2.00 per pound.
This is about 1/4 the price of German Sweet Chocolate.  The instructor
recommended -- and used -- Yucatan Dark "coating" chocolate with 60%
cocoa fat.  Premier will sell smaller quantities, and is apparently
willing to break off pieces -- at a higher price, of course.  I
haven't confirmed this.  One way to check the quality of chocolate is
by melting it in your mouth, rubbing it with your tongue against your
palate -- cheap chocolate is gritty.

If you can find it in a gourmet food store, try Poulain unsugured
cocoa.  This is not alkali process.  It contains more cocoa fat than
most other brands.  Droste, vanHouten, and Bensdorp were also
recommended.

Here is a recipe -- based on one in Maida Heatter's Chocolate book.

                Queen Mother Cake

8 oz.   Semi-sweet chocolate
6 oz.   Sweet butter
1/2 cup Sugar -- this is cut way down from the book
6       Eggs, seperated.  We used extra-large eggs, by the way.
6 oz    Blanched almonds.  Buy unblanched and blanch them yourself.

Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot water.
(Never, never, let chocolate get too hot.  Never let water come in
contact with melted chocolate.)  Remove from heat, stir until smooth.

In a food processor, finely grind the almonds with the sugar.  The sugar
absorbs the nut oil, preventing the almonds from forming nut butter.)

You will end up with a nut flour.  Cream the butter.  Add the egg
yolks to the butter, one at a time, mixing well after each.  Add
the chocolate, beating well.  Using low speed, slowly and thoroughly
mix in the almond-sugar mixture.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Beat the egg whites to medium peaks (with a pinch of salt).  Do not
beat to stiff peaks -- the oven heat will expand the air and, if you
have already beaten in as much air as the egg white can hold, the
bubbles will burst and your cake will fall.

Carefully fold the whites into the chocolate butter egg mixture.

Butter a 9 inch springform pan and line the bottom with a circle of
buttered wax paper.  (Butter is on both sides of the paper.)
Pour in the batter.

Bake 20 minutes at 375 degrees, reduce heat to 350, bake 50 minutes
longer.  When cooked, let the pan cool on a damp, folded towel on
the counter top for 20 minutes.  Remove the side wall of the pan and
invert the cake onto a cake rack.  Remove the bottom and re-invert
the onto another cake rack.  Allow to cook completely.

Coat with Chocolate Truffle mixture or Chocolate Glaze.

                        Chocolate Glaze

8 oz    Semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 cup Heavy cream

Melt together on a double boiler over very low heat, stirring.
Pour over the cake while still warm, letting it run 1/2 way down
the sides.  It will firm up when chilled.

Subject: compuetry and other curiotrophes

The following comes from a book by Robert Hendrickson, THE LITERARY
LIFE AND OTHER CURIOSITIES (Penguin), one of those irresistible
non-books. (NOTE to KRYPTN::MCGOWAN: I do not endorse Mr.
Hendrickson's wobbly syntax.)

                        COMPUTER POETRY

        Programmers can now feed a basic vocabulary into a computer's
memeory along with rules about a poem's structure and the machine will
write poems. Thus far the results aren't worthy of Edgar Guest, as
this cybernetic haiku composed at the Cambridge Language Research
Institute shows:

                All white in the buds
                I flash snowpeaks in the Spring.
                Bang the sun has fogged.

        Dr. William R. Bennett, Jr., a professor of physics and
computer expert at Yale University, in 1979 tackled the old hypothesis
that if enough monkeys pecked randomly at typewriters long enough they
could eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare. Yes, they
could, he calculated, but it would take almost an eternity. Dr.
Bennett figured that "if a trillion monkeys were to type ten randomly
chosen characters a second it would take, on the average, more than a
trillion times as long as the universe has been in existence just to
produce the sentence, 'To be or not to be, that is the question.'"
        A computer that had been programmed with the writings of James
Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, some twentieth-century women authors, and the
"angry young men" of the sixties recently "wrote" a novel called
BAGBONE, HEM, I DIE NOW (Vantage, 1980).

        Actually, there are some worthwhile things in the book ---
Hendrickson's, I mean:

        Ring Lardner is cited for a story about an ex-coroner who
wrote an ode to his mother with the line, "If perchance the inevitable
should come..."

        The story of James Thurber's experience as a newspaper
reporter is included. Thurber was toldby his editor to write short,
dramatic leads. He turned in a murder story that began:

                "Dead. That's what the man was
                when they found him with a knife
                in his back at 4 PM in front of Riley's
                Saloon at the corner of 52nd and
                12th Streets."

        Similarly, Mark Twain, as a reporter, was cautioned about
disclaimers of journalistic responsibility. He was told to qualify any
statement that he could not verify by personal knowledge. After
covering a gala social event, he wrote:

                "A woman giving the name of Mrs.
        James Jones, who is reported to be one
        of the society leaders  of the city, is
        said to have given what purported to be
        a party yesterday to a number of alleged
        lady's. The hostess claims to be the wife
        of a reputed attorney."

        Apart from these literary anecdotes, Hendrickson mentions the
name of the paragraph symbol --- anyone else know it? --- and explains
the origins of "ampersand" for the symbol over the 7 on the keyboard,
the difference betwen an umlaut and a dieresis, and other pressing
matters.

were admiring another friends new stereo system --- one of those
sleek, black Nikko systems that have more dials than the soap section
of Medi-Mart. You can program the tape deck to do just about anything
except make Mick Jagger sing "Ave Maria." Kind of user-inimical.
        "Oh, great," my PR1ME friend said, "tape decks are looking

Subject: Massive hotel telephone surcharges

Up until about 18 months ago, hotels were not allowed to add any surcharges
to telephone rates.  All calls were placed through operators at the phone
company operator assisted rate.  The phone company notified the hotel of
the charge by either calling the hotel or by sending the charge to a hard
copy terminal.  The phone company paid the hotel a 15% commission for
handling calls.  In order to foster competition, the FCC now allows hotels
to do what they want with long distance calls, both in terms of routing
and charging.

Making telephone calls from hotels has become a dangerous practice.  If
you are going to be in a hotel for a week and intend to use the phone a
lot, it now pays to have your own phone installed!

used figuratively, as the book closes quite nicely...) with useful and
useless words, definitions, and etymologies.  F'rinstance, how many of
the Desperados know what a merkin or a randan is?  If for no other

Subject: Cliches?

Sometimes a cliche is just a cliche, others it is a convenient way for
people to look down on a phrase they wish they had been clever enough
to coin themselves.  "More than likely" reminds me of the immortal
"more than somewhat" - if I were as good at that kind of thing as
Damon Runyon, I would not have to precede everything I write with a
semicolon.

Subject: Euphemisms

        I have a book about euphemisms and other doubletalk by Hugh Rawson.
It's entitled "A Dictionary of Euphemisms and Other Doubletalk".  In it, the
farm of "buy the farm" is said to refer to a grave.  (He gives several other
euphemisms for grave.  For example, among people who sell grave sites
door-to-door it is known as a "space" and is part of a "space and bronze
deal", the bronze referring to "memorial bronze".)  Unfortunately he doesn't
give anything to substantiate this interpretation, but it seems like the most
reasonable one to me.  At least that's what they seemed to be referring to in
stories where I've seen it used.
        I notice some Desperados object to hackneyed cliches.  Well, I do
too, but it's very difficult get rid of them.  As an example, "bite the dust"
(to die in combat) has been around for at least 2700 years.  This IS
documented in the aforementioned book where he quotes from a faithful (he
claims) translation of the Iliad:  "Not all these too many Achaians would
have bitten the dust, by enemy hands, when I was away in my anger" and "...
let many companions about him go down headlong into the dust, teeth gripping
the ground soil."  How would you like to have something you said hang around
that long?  For anyone who cares, the translation is by Richmond Lattimore.
        He interprets many other fascinating euphemisms, such as "aerodynamic
personnel decelerator" (a parachute), "sunshine" (when the NRC was the AEC it
tried talking about radiation as "sunshine units"), "sign off" (giving approval
without actually saying you approve), and "horsefeathers" (horse shit).  Also,
several Shakespearean euphemisms are decoded.  "Get thee to a nunnery" (go
work in a house of prostitution) was not the strongest thing the Bard ever
used.
        Overall, and in spite of the fact that many of the meanings behind the
euphemisms given are common knowledge, it's an interesting book and probably
deserves a place in the bookcase of any word freak.  Right up there next to
"The Dictionary of Misinformation" by Tom Burnam.  By the way, how many
Desperados know the origin of "drawing room" ("Let's go to the drawing room.")?
Even the paperback version of "The American Heritage Dictionary" has this one.

Subject: for HYDRA::HOOD, and anybody else interested...

One program that I use to allow me to do two or more different things is
called MULTITERM (you can get it from KIRK::SYS$SYSTEM:MULTITERM.EXE).
This is a variant on RTPAD (which is the program you run when you type
SET HOST nodename), that allows you to connect to up to five different
processes on different nodes.  You can switch back and forth between them
using CONTROL/Y, and entering a single-digit code.  Each process is
logged in as a full-blown interactive process, and they can be on any
node, local or remote (I haven't tried it to non-VMS nodes, though).

I use this program extensively, since I'm often working in another account
on KIRK, and I would like to read and maybe respond to mail and PHONE
calls when they occur.  It allows me to be editing a file, and then
switch over to another process to read mail, and then switch back to
my editing session.  Further, if you are running a program that takes
a long time to execute, and you switch over to another process, the
program will continue to run, halting only when it has to do terminal
I/O.  When you switch back, the program will then complete the I/O, and
proceed.  It is very useful, especially since the other processes can
be on other machines.  For those people who spend lots of time on
stand-alone machines, it can be very convenient.

I don't know where this program came from; I discovered it a long time
ago.  There is also another variant of this sort of thing around, but
I forget what it's called--I seem to remember it is more complicated
to use (but more flexible).  I think you can get it from the Toolshed
on METOO.

Did anyone else see Doonesbury's latest barb target (Wednesday's Boston Globe).

I have only had dealings with the Boston store and office that were
pluses. I used to work for an organization that had a rather large
group of word processors and they bought quite a bit of large
hardware, too (since I wasn't "into computers" when I worked there, I
don't know what it is). I was sent to the Boston office for training.
I ended up in the computer store accidentally (they don't call me
Wrongway for nothing) and I was given a fairly impressive reception by
them.  Then the people who were supposed to be training me talked me
into sending my resume to DEC.  2 weeks later... I became a Digit!!!

I occasionally stop down at the High Street Store to check outside
prices when I visit where I used to work and they always answer all my
questions and I come away loaded down with brochures and figures. I
think it's unfair to lump all of the stores together under one
reputation and it's EQUALLY unfair to keep slam-dunking sales people
in general when just a small part of the sales populace are
incompetent.

Does anyone that might have been in the Boston area between 1966 and 1969
remember Cousin Duffy on WMEX??  He had a style he called "Lovin' Touch"
and he used to send out small cards that gave a point rating for certain
loving and affectionate gestures, ranging from a gentle touch on the arm
to The Ultimate Loving Gesture.  WMEX was filled with very original DJ's
and I am trying to remember the DJ on that station (during the same time
period) who had that CONSISTENTLY strange "song" (for lack of a better
word) that had lyrics "One hen, two ducks, three squawking geese (SQUAWK!),
Four limerick oysters, five corpulent porpoises...." to "ten lyrical,
spherical diabolical denizens of the deep who hall stall around the corner
of the quo of the quay of the queasy at the very same time!! (boop, boop)".
There was also the "Disgusting Slogan Contest", of which the winner was
"Keep American Clean -- Eat a Pigeon".

Was I alone in Boston to hear all this or are there OTHER strange folks out
there?

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The Lovin' Touch was Dick Somebody.  Cousin Duffy was just Cousin
Duffy.  He once did a phone-in show with John Lennon from Toronto.
One caller said, "John?  John, I just want you to know you guys have
given me a couple of laughs every day ever since I heard of you." (In
the same vein, someone once came up to Paul McCartney on the ski
slopes and said, "Ram was one great album!" and skiied away.)  I don't
know who the deejay was with the porpoises, but one WMEX winner who's
still around is John H. Garabedian.  I hear him on 'BCN some Saturdays
and I think he works for a suburban station as well.  WMEX is now WITS
and lousy.
