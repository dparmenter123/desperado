 I'm almost a good baseball fan.  I discovered I needed glasses at age
 7 squinting to see the scoreboard at Pendleton Park, where the
 Valdosta Dodgers competed in the Class D Georgia-Florida League.
 There was some pitcher named Bledsoe from Macon that I actively
 hated.  For myself, I played many a sandlot game at right field (the
 traditional four-eyes position).  I even played softball quite a few
 years and once averted a riot by suggesting that two unruly mobs (my
 pals and some other bunch of pals) should play each other rather than
 fight for the one ball field.  I've seen the Indianapolis Clowns and
 Al Schacht and the King and his Court.  I go to see the Red Sox a few
 times every year, often enough to have seen them pull off a double
 steal and a suicide squeeze (rarities in the friendly confines of
 Fenway with the lumber-heavy, foot-heavy Red Sox).  I hate Larry
 Barnett (and the puling phony Ed Armbrister).  And yet there is a
 long gap in my record between the time the Dodgers betrayed me by
 leaving Brooklyn (and Vero Beach, only one state away) and the time
 my number-one son was old enough to demand to be taken to games.  In
 that period, to my shame, I lived for a time only three blocks away
 from Wrigley Field and never saw a game.  This despite the fact I was
 working nights and the Cubbies played only days, and also the fact
 that I could have had a free ticket any time I liked since I worked
 for a newspaper.  But I still felt betrayed by the Dodgers and I
 wasn't having any.

 My credentials are imperfect.  I rarely keep a score card, even
 though it adds so much, and I never look at a box score.  I'm a
 casual fan.  I contemn most of of the changes since the Dodgers did
 the dirty deed.  I like the tighter uniforms.  The old ones were
 just a little too goofy.  I like free agency, but I can't see the
 anti-trust exemption.  But I don't like:

        The designated hitter - It's a game of matchups and everyone
        ought to play it.  The most exciting single scene in baseball,
        to my taste, is a pitcher reaching second and shrugging on his
        warmup jacket.  I treasure the memory of Luis Tiant standing
        on second in Fenway in the greatest World Series ever.  And I
        cringe when I think of Orlando Cepeda galumphing down to
        first, past all baseball except the hitting.

        Turf - I like billiards, but I like shortstops better and I
        don't like those mechanical basepaths and the skittering ball
        and the accursed *seam*.  I much prefer the wily groundskeeper.

        The playoffs - the idea that the two number-four teams could
        meet in a world series is absolute anathema.  Let basketball
        and hockey play a season of exhibition games followed by an
        interminable big-money payoff, but give me a long season
        followed by a good series between the two best teams.

        Replacements - At big league rates, these guys are going to
        be paid close to what they're worth, although it's a fact
        that none of them can pull down even minor-league wages.
        They're the ball players who are left *after* all the major
        leaguers and minor leaguers are subtracted.  The hypocrisy of
        this exercise is brilliantly displayed in a piece by Steve
        Fainuru in the Boston Sunday Globe.  Joe Klein, general
        manager of the Detroit Tigers is talking to 500 hopefuls who
        have come for a tryout:  "I want to tell you that we will
        treat you with the same respect that we treat the game of
        baseball."  Having issued himself the perfect setup line,
        Klein proceeded to show his respect for the game of baseball
        by admitting to Fainuru that none of these folks had a chance
        of making even the replacement team.  Fainuru objects.  Klein
        answers, "I think you miss the point entirely.  It's the
        exposure it gives them, the opportunity to touch the game and
        put on the uniform . . . That's the beauty of it, in their
        own minds they do have a chance."  Klein neglected to add,
        "Suckers."

 I have no sympathy for baseball as it is, so if the owners want to
 tear it apart, they may continue.  But it's time to float an idea of
 what baseball could be as it goes into its third (calendar) century.
 There are two changes I'd like to see that would make every game
 more thrilling and bring a new character to the old game that is
 entirely fitting with its past.

 First, adopt the plan of English football whereby the bottom two
 teams in the majors each year are replaced by the top two teams from
 the minors.

 Second, break up the National and American Leagues and replace them
 with three (or four) regional leagues of eight teams each.

 Think of it:

 Eastern League             Central League        Western League

 1 Baltimore Orioles        Chicago White Sox     California Angels
 2 Boston Red Sox           Chicago Cubs          Los Angeles Dodgers
 3 New York Yankees         Detroit Tigers        San Diego Padres
 4 Montreal Expos           Minnesota Twins       San Francisco Giants
 5 New York Mets            Kansas City Royals    Colorado Rockies
 6 Philadelphia Phillies    St. Louis Cardinals   Oakland A's
 7 Pittsburgh Pirates       Cincinnati Reds       Seattle Mariners
 8 Toronto Blue Jays        Cleveland Indians     Portland Skidders
   Atlanta Braves           Houston Astros        Honolulu Ukeleles
   Florida Marlins          Milwaukee Brewers     Los Mayas de Ciudad Mexico
   Habana Reyes de Sucre    Texas Rangers         Nippon Ham Fighters

 If we can get excited about the Graperuit League in years when
 there's a legitimate spring training season, imagine the frisson we'd
 get from the New York championship, the Chicago championship, the
 California championship, the Texas championship, the Canadian (!)
 champion.

 These leagues aren't perfect.  I couldn't really choose which eastern
 team to drop so I decided to give the hit to my former home, Atlanta.
 It's a team that's skipped town twice looking for money and also
 displaced the Atlanta Crackers, so there.  Too many teams clutter the
 Central League  (maybe there should be a Southwest League too), and
 there are too few in the Western League, but forget the details and
 think of a three-way World Series.  The current fake "Championship
 Series" is not half a patch on that.  And there would be no
 meaningless games if the bottom teams were in danger of falling down
 a league.  And what would it mean to Memphis and Pawtucket, Boise and
 Ottawa to have a crack at the big time?  No more playing for average
 if you could move your whole team up a grade.  But no more license
 to print money for team owners either.  Imagine the world-wide
 thrill if the Havana Sugar Kings came into the bigs as the New York
 Yankees slipped down to Triple-A.  The thrill would be smaller, but
 the same, when Valdosta suddenly found itself playing against
 Raleigh instead of Thomasville.

 That's not to mention all the debates about the many small
 differences that would arise between the leagues.  I'm sure the DH
 would survive in the sensation-hungry Western League, but how about
 three league's worth of rumors about rabbit balls and high strike
 zones and "You know, Biff, they just don't come down as hard on
 spitballers in the Southwestern League" and "The reigning Canadian
 champion has never beaten the reigning New York champion" and the
 annual swing each league would take at the other two some time
 around midseason and the incredible growth of nuance and interest
 all around.

 There might even be player leagues, or at least, player owned
 teams, municipally owned (and isn't that better than building
 edifices for others?), or even cooperatives.

 Something's got to be done to snap the grand old game out of its
 dark ages.  This is the seventh strike in 20 years.  Let's toss it
 all up in the air and see what comes down.

Latest InfoPro Release a Big Hit Despite Spurious Output Problems

First the good news. Steven Jacob Fiedler (SJF), the interestingly-named
latest BabyWare product from InfoPro Systems (Rescue, CA), was not only
released two weeks ahead of schedule, but appears perfect in every way,
according to a panel of medical analysts. After initial tests in the OST
Labs, we can attest that SJF appears to operate well within normal
parameters for this sort of product.

The question remains, however, whether the market will accept offerings
of this nature with poor documentation and operational difficulties
(more details below).

First Look

Our first look at SJF (rumored to be a companion product for
the wildly successful Scott Michael Fiedler (SMF) released almost
five years ago) came just before 10 AM on March 14, 1994. We greatly
admire the fortitude of Susan Fiedler, VP in charge of production,
who was extremely involved with the actual delivery. The aggressive
production schedule took just under nine months from start to finish.

And the finish was quite an operation. Even David Fiedler, InfoPro
Systems' CEO, was on hand at the finale, which served as a grand opening
as well as a new product release. It's an axiom in the industry that
Mr. Fiedler is personally responsible for the initial conception of
all InfoPro products and this SJF is no exception. SJF does exhibit
characteristics that show the influence of both Fiedlers, as well
as the effects of careful product design and implementation.

You Want Me to Clean What?

Unfortunately, in the excitement of product release, InfoPro's
quality control seems to have slipped. SJF was delivered with no user
documentation whatsoever, meaning that users will be forced to interpret
and handle all interrupts themselves.

In the case of SJF, this might prove quite a burden. In just the first
24 hours, the OST Labs staff found itself dealing with numerous
audio alerts, some measuring well over 100 dB. Not only would this
level of output be unacceptable in most offices, but only Susan
Fiedler proved capable of stopping this unwanted behavior, using a
complex procedure involving SJF's input port that we feel most users
would not be able to perform themselves.

But wait, there's more. At random intervals, we noted both liquid
and solid output emanating from SJF's dual output ports. We hesitate
to comment on the nature of this output, but feel that it will definitely
prove incompatible with most computer hardware. We were frustrated
to hear that the vendor doesn't expect this problem to clear up for
several years at best.

Summary

In spite of these problems, however, SJF has captured the
hearts of our entire review staff. We are convinced that this latest
offering from InfoPro shows the same potential for universal acceptance
as its previous SMF, and that despite the limited production run,
it will be a total success for many years to come.

Executive Summary: an elegant solution to an age-old problem. Excellent
workmanship and impeccable functioning, though the lack of documentation
could be a problem for novice users. Apparent software bugs (spurious
audio, liquid, and solid output) are problematic, but the vendor expects
these to be gradually eliminated.

Price: not determined at press time. 24-hour support will be included, however.

Supported platforms: will eventually run everywhere.

Subject: Quality Assurance Reports aren't ALL boring...

    ...  So  there's this old QAR floating around from the VMS Version
    4.0  database  that came to light today.  VMS has this 'wonderful'
    little  feature  that  allows  people  to  have  'totally'  random
    passwords  generated for them.  The user decides to change his/her
    password    to    a   generated   string   by   asking   for   SET
    PASSWORD/GENERATE.  Lists of five passwords are shown and the user
    can  choose  from  each list or ask for a new list, until they are
    happy.

    So it was noticed early on in the developemnt of the code for this
    little  command  that  certain  strings  must  not appear in these
    random  passwords.   For  example, the f-word and its ilk.  Hence,
    the  passwords  became  'random'  (quoted),  meaning  that certain
    random ones would be banned.

    To implement  this,  a  list of twelve or so in the Most Offensive
    Verbiage  was  placed into the code, each letter being replaced by
    the  following  letter  in  the alphabet in order that we not ship
    these  actual  words  in  our product.  So there are places in the
    executive where a debugger might show you

                gvdl

    and you can reason it out.

    This worked  fine until our fellow workers in France got a hold of
    it.   The equivalent words in French are, of course, different and
    could  (did)  show  up.   Also  the equivalent words in just about
    every european language.

    What did these kind people do? They FILED A QAR.  What did it say?
    In very nice words, it said we had overlooked a lot of nasties and
    would we please DO SOMETHING.  To further assist us, they included
    translations  from the American list into French, German, Swedish,
    Yugoslav, English, Danish, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Polish.

    (Reading through  the English list made me wonder how Monty Python
    gets on the air at all.  According to this list, 'crap' is English
    for the s-word in American, and it gets touchier still ...)

    The list  makes  for good reading but would certainly get me fired
    if I let it propagate through the network.  As I PAGED through it,
    I  noticed  FOOTNOTES.   I  ran  to the end of the list to see the
    footnotes.

    Foot #1  was that there was no direct translation -- this occurred
    for   the   b-word   (rhyme   "which")   and   the  n-word  (rhyme
    "Heidigger"). These were replaced with cultural approximations.

    The one that really set me rocking, and which spurred this lengthy
    joke/note,  was the t-word (rhyme "bits") in Swedish.  There was a
    blank space in the table with a footnote 2.

    Foot #2 said only: "The female breast is not vulgar in any form in
    Swedish."

    Swedes.  Ya gotta love 'em.  :-)

DEFICIENCY IN VMS PASSWORD GENERATOR
====================================

It come has to our attention that the VMS source code contains a list of
rude words (module CLIUTL, file PASSWORDS.LIS, line 282, routine
generate_passwords). The purpose of this list is to prevent the password
generator from suggesting an obscene password. Furthermore, an attempt
has been made to translate this list into several foreign languages.
Being in an international environment here in Valbonne we really
appreciate this; however, the translation is not complete and does not
include all of the European languages.

Please find below a selection of words from the VMS rude word list with
full translation into ten other languages. We hope you will be able to
use this information in a future version of VMS.

 I disguised all the bad words.  I wasn't offended by breasts,
 bitch, or hell, so I left them alone, but at that I wonder if
 there's really full fungibility between merde and s2t, and I can't
 imagine that bordel is really French for hell, but there it is,
 another piece of unsubstantiated net folklore.  I still don't have

Tom,

I've seen criticism by Brunvald [or is it Brunvand?  Brunvald looks right, like
it means Brown Woods or somesuch] himself of News of the Weird; my take on it
is that Brunvald has seen so many myths that he mistakes actual occurrences as
myths even if they do happen.  Whatever urban legends NotW might propagate,
NotW is not itself the creator of such; blame the original reporters.  Each
story is carefully attributed such that any interested party can look it up,
e.g.

        * In Columbia, S. C., in December, Rev. Noel Vande Grift revealed
        plans to expand his 20-member [Richard M.] Nixon Memorial Church,
        a congregation blending Baptist and Quaker preachings.  Vande
        Grift said the inspiration to name the church after the former
        president came during a prayer.  He told reporters the church
        would be the largest in the South by the year 2010. [The State
        (Columbia), 12-28-94]

The source and date are given, as you can see, and Chuck Shepherd does this
with every story he publishes.  Also, not much urban legend content to this
story:  many of the stories in NotW are not "legend" material - they're more
in the "people can sure be goofy" genre.  Ditto with Randy Cunningham's
column.  Anyway, I'd take some of the stories with a grain of salt, but don't
write them off due to "absence of attribution", but rather due to errors on
the part of the original reporters.

Eric Haines

 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
 Brunvand (whatever, I can't find the books right now) kind of muddies
 the water.  For instance, even as he is telling of several cases when
 someone actually did fill a spurning sweetheart's car with cement he
 identifies the tale as an urban myth.  On the other hand, not
 everything you read in the papers is true.  I really prefer Cecil
 Adams'Inside Dope, Charles Panati's Beginnings, and David Feldman's
 Imponderables, and for the weird stuff I prefer the original,
 Esquire's Dubious Achievements.  I particularly wish Spy maganzine
 wouldn't try this game.
