Tom,

Just a late comment on some recent discussions:

My wife, who is a pediatritian, insists on occasionally
using the word "non-dysfunctional".  After a long discussion,
she won me over.  Apparently it is only used in situations
where dysfunctional behavior is the norm.  Amazing this hasn't
been applied to usenet yet.

Regards,

bill

I wish the Romans had subscribed to the E-Prime philosophy -  from my Latin
textbook I find thirty some odd conjugated forms of 'to be', including

  present:         sum es est             sumus estis sunt
  perfect:         fui fuisti fuistis     fuimus fuistis fuerunt
  pluperfect:      fueram fueras fuerat   fueramus fueratis fuerant
  future:          ero eris erit          erimus eritis erunt
  future perfect:  fuero fueris fuerit    fuerimus fueritis fuerint
  imperfect:       eram eras erat         eramus eratis erant

Bear in mind that this is only the active voice - to include the passive you
must add this many more.  Then if you wish to include such expressions as 'to
be able' (possum potes potest ...) you may add yet another fifteen or so forms
to your repertoire of LUK (Later Useless Knowledge).

I say we should revise the classic languages curriculum post-haste ... I mean,
why not?  Ted Turner colorized 'Citizen Kane' didn't he?

Subject: E-prime

I think that the remark "E-prime is a human language" contains a delicious
irony, since it describes E-prime using the forbidden verb.

Spanish has two separate verbs for "to be".  The verb "ser" is for immutable,
permanent states of being, while "estar" is used for temporary states of being
and for states of location.  "I am here" is thus "Estoy aqui'", and "Are you
sick?" is "?Esta' usted enfermo?", but "I am Paul" is "Soy Pablo".  One always
uses "ser", not "estar", when telling a woman she is beautiful.

&gt; Only the Laconians are laconic and the only mammals are females and a
&gt; pinafore must be pinned on the forepart and a bonfire is only for
&gt; burning bones.

Actually, nearly all male mammals have breast tissue (I can think of no
exceptions, but I've been a biologist long enough to avoid saying "all"--nature
loves exceptions to rules).  Under the proper hormonal conditions, male breast
tissue can develop just like female breast tissue, as many bodybuilders who
overindulge in steroids have found out to their dismay.

Most male mammals also have nipples, the only exception being rats.  The
remaining quesiton thus is, do lawyers really have nipples, or do they wear
falsies to deceive the rest of us?

    marble *every* message with keywords likely to tweak the
    nose of the mythological beast.  In service of such
    cybernoia, the gnu-emacs editor helpfully provides a

    strange paragraph.  (If the frumious Sniffer snatches
    this bit o' bandwidth, I'll be glad to testify at your

Well!  On military machines serving foreign bases, at least, "M-x

he was finally able to reply this week,

 I used to work on a typesetting and layout tool called VAX DOCUMENT.
 Among other things we supported security markings.  A big customer
 and field test site had some problems with the way we had done it and
 sent some suggestions for improvement.  Following up assiduously we
 sent back sample pages marked TOP SECRET ("This is top secret",was
 the text), CLASSIFIED ("This is classified"), and so forth.

 A couple of days later we got a whispering phone call from our
 customer begging us never to do that again.  They had immediately
 locked the sample pages in a drawer and got everyone in to look at
 them within fifteen minutes of their arrival, whereupon they burned
 them all before the security guys could find out that they had
 CLASSIFIED material coming in the US Mail.  (It was during this phase
 of development that I made the curious discovery that UNCLASSIFIED
 is, in fact, a security classification, not a residual category.)

The clones beat Apple to the punch yet again.

From: Guy Hillyer &lt;guy&gt;

Idaho Computing (Orofino, Idaho) has taken multimedia one step further
with the introduction of the ScentMaster, a PC add-in board that uses
chemicals to generate scents. Referred to by the company as the
olfactory or "olaf" board, the $199 ScentMaster consists of a 16-bit
board, three external chemical vials, and a small spray-emitter
module. The chemicals last up to six months and refills are $5.99
each.

The scent board functions as a sound card, interpreting files with an
OLF extension. Instead of playing sounds, however, the ScentMaster
mixes three chemicals (primary scents) to produce the desired
effect. Users can chose from 36 included smells such as "roses," "new
car," "roasted coffee," and "dead animal in wall."

Additional scent software and a Macintosh version are planned by the
end of the year. "We are trying to appeal to all sorts of tastes,"
said Idaho Computing president Jennifer Zimmer. For more information,
send e-mail to idaho@netaxis.com.

Subj:   Plug and Play

Yes, gentle readers, it's time once again for the Windows 9x anecdote of
the day. Today I have two of them.

The first comes a friend of mine who was playing with his beta last night,
and wanted to copy a floppy disk. Try as he might, he couldn't figure out
how to do it. He tried dragging icons around, clicking, and so on, and then
finally decided that well, Windows 95 has this cool new help system, so why
not use that?

He went into help, looked up the word "copy" and saw an entry on how to
copy floppy disk. He clicked that button, and the entry showed him the
command to type, and helpfully let him create a DOS window to do it in.

That's right, gentle readers, the new, user-whizzy, better-than-a-Mac
system creates a DOS window and tells you the command to type. Cool, huh?
Ain't '70s nostalgia wonderful? Look for the accompaning "Brady Bunch"
interactive CD, and polyester bellbottoms to come with Windows 9x to get
you in the proper mood.

For the next one, this course announcement came to an Eristocrat. Take a
look at this -- to learn about "Plug and Play," you pay US$350 and it is
recommended that you already know about NT. To be fair to Microsoft, this
probably says as much about the chutzpah of the instructor and the
intelligence of the system administrators as it does about Win9x. After
all, Dogbert never went broke by playing to the intelligence of MIS folks.

However, in the interests of providing a service to my readers, here is a
course in Plug and Play that I'll only charge US$50 for, simplified
suitably for the Learninge Experience [tm, sic] of the Dilbert's Boss types
of the world:

Chapter 1 -- Hardware
(a)     Turn the machine off
(b)     Connect the new hardware
(c)     Turn the machine on.

Chapter 2 -- Software
(a)     Put the disk in the computer
(b)     Double-click on the installer icon
(c)     When a dialog box comes up, click the button marked "OK"

Gentle Readers, if it isn't that simple, it isn't Plug and Play.

So without further delay, here is the course some clever soul is making a
living at.
