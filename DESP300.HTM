 DESPERADO, Born with the gift of laughter and a sense that the world is mad

 Welcome to the Internet incarnation of Desperado.  What was once a
 monthly Digital deluge has become a daily infobahn drizzle.  Desperado
 started out at DEC in 1978 the day I first received mail from a
 mailing list.  It went on from there for several hundred issues
 becoming quite stylized in the process and then sort of petered out
 along with the rest of my life at DEC.

 After a year or so -- both in and out of work -- of trying to
 continue with Desperado on the Internet in the digested Digital
 fashion, I concluded that I didn't like doing it that way anymore.
 Henceforth, one or two or three or four funky forwards a day,
 interspersed with irregular -- highly irregular -- commentary from
 me.  The usual, but, more often.  I try to add value with everything
 I forward, removing mail-header underbrush, reformatting text, maybe
 adding a comment or chatting back.

 When anything I send out provokes a response, I may forward the
 response too.  But I won't forward every response and I won't
 necessarily respond personally either.  Tough, eh?  I'm going to be
 ruthless in selecting what I forward, so you be ruthless in what you
 send me.

 What you'll get each day is a few selected forwards of something
 amusing that you probably haven't seen before, larded through with
 original stuff from me and my contributors (maybe you), all
 guaranteed worthless junk mail.  I always delete most mail headers
 and all that network crap.  Everything that's indented one space is
 written by me, as is everything enclosed by lines of | (ASCII 174).
 God knows who wrote the other stuff, but I don't make it any easier
 by editing so much out.  The aim is an entertaining experience.  Let
 someone else track down the sources.

 Like other lists, you should just watch for awhile to catch the drift.

 We take our motto, as always, from Langston Hughes:

                I stay cool and dig all jive,
                  That's the way I stay alive.
                My motto, as I live and learn, is
                  "Dig and be dug in return."

 Desperado has been a moderated list since Day One, so feel free
 to use reply-to to get to me.

 News on archiving may be forthcoming any day now, or maybe not.

 To be added to the list, send mail with no subject line to

                majordomo@world.std.com

 with the message

                subscribe desperado

 To escape, it's

                unsubscribe desperado

 Tally ho!
