Classy country singer Janie Fricke has a new song out called

        'The First Word in Memory is Me'

but it has nothing whatsoever to do with computers.

Double-meaning phrase tossed off at a meeting two weeks ago:

        'and then it does computer sorts of things'

The speaker meant 'computer kind of stuff', but someone took him to
mean something more formal.

Smoke and Joke Department:  I was at a meeting in a tiny airless room
the other day.  Since I was the first one there, I tossed the ashtray
into the trash can.

A smoker came to the meeting, bearing one of those smoke-sucker
ashtrays, which unfortunately had a dead battery.  Several people,
including me, said please don't smoke.  She said she'd cut down, but
she refused to comply and not smoke.

Since we were making a presentation to her, it hardly seemed the time
to make a big issue. She only smoked two cigarets, when normally she
would have smoked five or six, but basically the corporate smoking
policy did not work.  I was in a course a couple of weeks ago that was
held in a meeting room in Marlboro with a sign that said 'Smoking by
consensus only' and no one smoked, but I still say the rule should be
no smoking in conference rooms (with regular breaks).

Subj:   Computer-Aided Warfare

In an article entitled "Can Computers Cope with War?" in the Sci-Tech
section of today's Boston Globe, there's a discussion about giving more
decision-making power to computers.  Currently, humans and computers form
a checks-and-balances system in our nuclear defence policies.  A few
interesting points:

   - In the eighteen month span ending June 30, 1980, there were
     3703 false alarms of Soviet attacks.  These turned out to be
     due largely to broken components, forest fires, solar flares,
     and airplane crashes, as well as actual Soviet missile test
     flights.

   - The United States is studying two different, independent proposals
     which will give computers more power in the defense process.  One,
     of course, is the "Star Wars" killer satellite program.  The other is
     called the Strategic Computing Program, which hopes to develop
     computer-controlled, autonomous air-, land-, and sea-based weapons.

Anyhow, a good chunk of the article is devoted to bugs which have popped-up
in more conventional (non-military) computer-controlled applications.  (I
won't list them here; we all see smaller examples just about every day.)

The article ends by quoting James Fletcher, head of the panel advocating
the Star Wars program... "[It is] clearly one of the largest software
problems ever tackled, requiring an enormous and error-free program on the
order of ten million lines of code."

That's followed by a quote from Paul Bracken, a Yale political scientist
and an authority on nuclear strategies (according to the article)... "By
the fifteenth or sixteenth general nuclear war, we'd probably get the bugs
out.  But you only get one shot at this -- you'd better come awfully close
to getting it right the first time."

ie:  There's no version 2.0?  (awfully close?)

Subj:   The Great Chile Cook-off

I wasn't planning on getting involved in the great chile debate; that's one
game you'll never win.  But after trying some of the recipes from the recent
issues of Desperado, I felt it was my civic duty to enlighten those less
fortunate than I.

I won't attempt to give an exact recipe for my chile; I never measure the
ingredients.  I just toss 'em til it tastes right.  But here's an attempt:

  1.5 lbs chuck cut into .5" cubes
  1 lb ground pork
  1 lb chorico or linguico (hot Portuguese sausage) cut into .5" slices
  3 or 4 onions
  3 cloves garlic
  A handful of chile powder
  Cumin seed
  Oregano
  Salt
  Cayenne Pepper
  4 fresh tomatoes or 2 cans tomato sauce
  15 jalapenos
  pinto beans (optional)

I'm not going to debate the relative merits of beans in chile; if you like 'em,
use 'em.  But use fresh ones.  The night before you plan to make the chile, pour
the bean in a large bowl, cover them with cold water, then add 1 tsp oil,
1 clove minced garlic, and a few chopped jalapenos.  Leave it to soak overnight,
and they'll be ready for use in the morning.

On to the meat of the matter:  you may call me a heretic (or lunatic for that
matter) for putting the hot sausage in chile, but trust me.  Sear it quickly
over a high flame.  Drain and set aside.  Then do the pork, drain and set aside.
Then sear the chuck chunks and drain.  Then throw 'em all into a dutch oven.

In a food processor, throw in 2 onions, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 tomatoes, and
most of the peppers.  Whiz it into a red-green pulp and add it to the meat.
Chop the remaining tomatoes, onions and peppers into little chunks and add to
meat.  Rinse the beans, retaining the peppers and garlic you added.  Throw that
into the meat.  Add the spices til it tastes right.  Bring to a boil, reduce
to a simmer, and cover.  Cook for at least 4 hours, stirring occassionally, and
adding water as necessary.  (But not too much - I like my chile thick.)  After
the chile's been cooked, to adjust the consistency, put 3 Tbsp of flour in a
cup, add enough warm water to turn it into a thick, flowable paste.  Add to the
chile and simmer another hour.

Remember:  the longer chile cooks, the better.  And it's great reheated!

Serve with cheese, nacho chips, and lotsa Dos Equis.

Theories abound on the network thing.  Some say it was that chain
letter that I've deleted 37 copies of in the past three years.  Of the
hundreds who forwarded the damn thing, only one has come forward.
Some say some VP (or some President) got a naughty note in the mail.
Some say it's aimed at EMS (hence the use of the word 'subscribers').
Others say that as soon as the ENet police arrive, Engineering will
set up another net of its own so we can continue to live life as we
are accustomed to her.  Some say it's a new manager feeling his oats
(shortly before getting trampled by the horses).  Some say, what good
is a teapot with no tempest in it?

I think that "misuse of ENET" message may have been aimed more at the chain
letter that was making the rounds two years ago, and again about two months
ago, than at things like notesfiles and DESPERADO.  If you haven't seen the
chain letter, it originated somewhere on the ARPANET about three years ago.
I am embarrassed to admit that I was the person who first forwarded it from
the ARPANET into the ENET, almost three years ago.  Most people forwarded it,
I think, not because of the content of the message, but because of the amazing
forwarding history it had accumulated.

After it ricocheted around the ENET the first time, I thought (wished) I'd
seen the last of it.  But this summer, some turkey who had kept a copy in
his mail file for over a year decided it would be amusing to resurrect
it.  Within a week four copies of the message crossed my terminal.
I immediately deleted them.

Shortly thereafter I got a nasty anonymous phone call from someone
in Shrewsbury who complained that the chain letter was clogging up their
systems and not very nicely demanded that I never forward such a letter
again.

I pointed out that I had forwarded it over two years ago, and that
he should be complaining at the turkey who had recently resurrected
it.  He hung up.

I agree that we need to be very careful not to inhibit open use of the
ENET.  But I also don't like getting nuisance calls from anonymous system
managers, so I'd really rather people would just delete chain letters
(especially THE chain letter) than forward them.

Tom, let me tell you a little bit about Bel Cross. He's the new head
of DIS, Digital Information Services, which purports to be the
spiritual home of all MIS departments at DEC. This purportment exists
largely in their own minds, but it is true that MIS enclaves out here
in the revenue boondocks are "dotted-line" to DIS. Bel is in fact the
new Colonel Crawford. He used to be head of some manufacturing
facility up in Augusta, and his chief claim to fame is that once,
during a building freeze, he showed up at committee meetings for six
months straight asking for a new warehouse. The committee, worn to a
frazzle by such relentless tactics, unlimbered the coffers and built
him one.

Prior to his emergence, the only thing I had heard from DIS in the
last three years is a poster that showed up last year with a
four-color mind map on it, labelled the DIS Vision. The fact that this
has never before been mentioned in DESPERADO gives you some idea of
its impact. That they would present a mind map as an end product
instead of the aid to thought that it is supposed to be gives you an
idea of their impact.

So what have we here? We have a department with an impressive charter,
a copy of which I will send you off-line, and a hot shot with curly
hair and no back to his head who has a reputation as a hired killer.
Whether he thinks he can beef up this reputation by taking the scalp
of the one thing that makes this joyless son-of-a-bitching
soul-killing job tolerable is on the knees of the gods. But my resume
is updated, on  the streets, and if anybody out there has a job for an
applications programmer who wants to be a writer, but who is
understandably nervous about signing her name to a diatribe -- hang on
to it, I'll find you somehow!

Subj:   The infamous Cross/PB memo

I have it from a good source that BJ does not view the memo that
started on MTS and made its way into EasyNet, Soapbox and Desperado as
a sweeping policy statement against all non-business-related use of
the EasyNet.

My understanding is that the intent of the memo was somewhat narrower
than that; that it was intended to address a serious resource crunch
in the EMS or MTS world, or that it was aimed at clear abuses such as
the chain letter that has been around for the last few years or at
irresponsible behavior during prime time or on over-loaded machines.

More specifically, I have reason to believe that BJ does not
disapprove of participation in non work related notes files or the
personal use of electronic mail so long as they are done on one's own
time, and in ways that do not harm the company.

The net result is this is still DEC, and you should still "do the
right thing".

Well, if that's what he meant, he should have said so.  I wasn't
planning to quit on the basis of that note anyway.  Nor did anybody
else.  All my regular lists are still sending.  I did hear that BJODAY
was defunct, but I'm not on it and get it only occasionally.  The
following does not necessarily refer to BJODAY.  (Maybe BJ objected to
the name BJODAY, but, considering the acronym involved, it could have
been worse.) (BJODAY is "bad joke of the day", and how!)

I don't think BJ had your little enterprise in mind, Tom.  If you
look a little closer at his message, you'll notice that he specifically
objected to people forwarding things that others will find offensive.
I have a theory on what exactly he meant.

Like you, I get a lot of junk along with the good stuff, and I've noticed
lately that some of the "jokes" have slipped over the edge, descending
from the merely tasteless to the vicious and racist.

A few days ago, I received a collection of such jokes (and hit the D key).
Later that same day, I received BJ's note from somebody else.  I have to think
the two items were related.  I have to believe that somebody else noticed
the increased ugliness and brought the matter to corporate attention.

Taken in this light, BJ is right.  The net can do without racist or sexist or
ethnic slurs.  And if we can police this ourselves, I'm sure BJ will let
us flame away in Desperado and the thousands of notes files.

In any event, Tom, I hope you keep on publishing.  And if they take
away the net, there's lots of Xerox machines around.

Dammit, we need things like this as you say to keep the DEC
culture alive and well.  We Europeans (and even europeanized Americans
like me) depend on Desperados for the latest interesting info and
Btidbits from DEC all over the place.  One thing which has made DEC so
good in the past was that is a NETWORK (read the book Megatrends by
John Naisbitt) with people all over the place helping people all
over the place.  Ever notice how this structure is reflected in DECnet?
Just plug it in and it works.

Subj:   A response to the "E" net usage issue....

        Tom,

        Looking back upon my short(10 yr) experience as a DEC wars veterinarian
        with the recent Bell Cross, "BJ" memo in mind, I find I must speak out.

        This company has grown and prospered because we the people have all
        wanted to "do the right thing". Part of this "do the right thing" is
        the exchange of ideas in an open, catalytic environment. As a result of
        the divisionalization of the company, this idea exchange has been
        slowed even stopped. The "E" net has provided a linking mechanism, a
        means to reconnect the people who want to "do the right thing".

        This company runs on people knowing people not organizational
        structure. For people to know people, to develop/maintain the
        relationships that allow people to get the job done inspite of the
        system, thoughts and ideas other than purely work related information
        must be exchanged. After all we are just people.

        Thoughts and ideas go over the "E" net instead of through face to face
        contact. That communication path must remain open in order for us to
        "do the right thing".

        That said I must comment on the "quality" of some of the recent ideas
        that have come over the ether. The communications can go too far.
        In order to prevent "formal actions", we the users must use our heads
        and think before sending something off.

        In my opinion there has been some real trash sent over the network.
        This trash is what I believe Bell and BJ were commenting about.
        I apply the following rules when I want to input or forward
        anything:

                1. Would I want my wife to see this.
                2. Would it be appropriate in a meeting with my management.
                3. Would it harm the competitive position of DEC.

        CRTICISM of DEC products/strategies/etc is by all means APPROPRIATE!

Obviously I wouldn't agree with #2.  My description of Desperado (from
the note I send to new subscribers)

            'OFTEN ROWDY, BUT NEVER RAW, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT

'Desperado is an electronic rag that I send around the net from time to
time to several hundred Digital desperados from Australia to Sweden,
and even in Marlboro.  Everyone on the list is there by request.
(There are also lots of forwards, secondary and tertiary desperados,
but I don't know about them.)

[reprinted from "The National Inquisitor"]

CHILD ABDUCTED BY WILD FONT

(Silicon Valley)

Nine year old Donna Marie DiAngelo was delighted when her dad brought home
a new "personal laser printer" for the DiAngelo family home computer. "With
this `productivity device' our family will have more effective printed
communication," said Hamilton ("Bud") DiAngelo to his happy household.

But the dream turned into a nightmare when little Donna Marie tried to print
out her Christmas letter to Santa. As the compact marking engine was humming
away on her text page file, Donna Marie tried to open the device to see "Where
all the little pixels go," and before the eyes of her horrified parents she was
dragged into the innards of the system by a wild font.

"It was absolutely horrible," sobbed Betty DiAngelo, "that thing just reached
right out with one of its extruders and snagged poor Donna Marie on its
wicked serifs." "Just like hauling in a fish with a gaffing hook," said Bud
DiAngelo, an avid angler in happier days. "There wasn't a thing we could
do."

The DiAngelos struggled in vain to pull Donna back into the safety of the
family den, but the sturdy font was too strong for them. Despite the
screams of the terrified child, the DiAngelos were unable to extricate Donna
Marie from the clutches of the renegade "Lucida" font. Their daughter was
sucked into the software. When police and fire department rescue squads tried
to go into the printer after Donna Marie, they were halted by an impenetrable
maze of bizarre characters, and ultimately driven back by a mind-boggling
font file format. "Those extended ASCII sets and proprietary font encodings
are real `bears'," said Captain Bert Powers of the Silicon Valley Thought
Police. Authorities are reluctant to turn off the table-top printer to analyze
Donna Marie's whereabouts in the system because, "She might still be in RAM,"
as Captain Powers explained it.

The font's co-creator, internationally famed typeface designer and Stanford
Professor Charles Bigelow, was called in as a consulting expert to help in
the rescue of Donna Marie. "The Inquisitor" asked Professor Bigelow how such
a thing could happen. "You have to understand that this is a new font, just
out of beta test," explained Prof. Bigelow. "It's a young, vigorous, husky
design, with a lot of stamina and strength. People have to be ready for its
clarity and power. It apparently overwhelmed little Donna Marie." Local
authorities asked Bigelow why tragedies like this haven't happened with
other laser printer fonts. "You have to remember," answered Bigelow, "that
most other laser fonts are just worn out veterans of obsolete analog metal
typography."

"For example," he explained, "Times Roman is 53 years old and Helvetica is
27 years old, but it's seen a lot of column inches." Most readers don't
realize it, but those weary old fonts are really past retirement, but have
been pressed back into service because of a lack of imaginative, innovative
designs for digital technology. Basically, those over-worked hot-metal typeface
designs are like a toothless old lion, arthritic with age and limp with
exhaustion. The Lucida fonts, in contrast, are full of excitement, with a rich
variety of expressions and a forceful impact for the new generation of
communicators."

As Bigelow talked, he and his partner, former free-spirit modern dancer
calligrapher Kris Holmes, were arming themselves with the tools of their
trade -- 9H mechanical pencils, drafting film, reducing glasses, digitizer
tablets, cubic splines, and bitmap editors ("In case it gets really rough --
like we meet up with the jaggies!") -- and preparing to go into the printer
controller after little Donna Marie. "We think it's the Serifed Italic that's
got her," said Bigelow, "and that alphabet can be really tough; but Kris knows
how to handle it -- after all, she learned her cursive from Lloyd (`Calligrapher
Laureate') Reynolds." With Kris Holmes leading the way, and Bigelow reciting
a Latin incantation about St. Francis of Griffo, they went off into the printer
at a 45-degree angle.

In the future, the DiAngelos plan to use only sans-serif typefaces for print
out by their younger children. "The Lucida Sans Roman seems safe enough,"
said Betty DiAngelo, "but then it's hard to know what to expect in this new
era of digital typography." And she glanced anxiously at the deceptively
innocuous looking little printer, from which occassional chanting and
muttered imprecations could still be heard.

In discussing the topic with a former manager of CRAY's Technical Documen-

exactly how Digital produces what they consider the best systems documenta-
tion in the industry today!

I'd send this to our publicity folks, but don't know who they are.
I've been seeing lots of ads that go, roughly, as follows:

        Buy this wonderful work-station product!  It has loads of
        capacity, lots of programs, is compatable with others of our
        products, is ever-expanding, and can be used in a network
        environment etc etc etc

After about a minute of this I was convinced that it was a Digital ad.
Then they said "TEAM XEROX".

I've seen dec ads on public tv, but never something as catchy as this
on REGULAR tv, and I'd like to know why!  It was aimed at the business
computer purchaser and was quite effective.  When will our publicity folks
realize that not all of the business purchasers are out there watching
renditions of the Nutcracker or programs on catching polar bears?  Lots
of them watch Knight Rider, Dr. Who, the 5 zillion dollar pyramid and
Monday night football!

Subj:   have you visited the mark twain house in hartford?

While it may not be enough to entice you to drive to Hartford (a drearier
ride this side of the west Kansas prairie is not to be found), it's a good
take. Among other things, one learns that Twain loved burglar alarms and had
them all over the house; but never turned them on for fear that a burglar
would enter the house, set them off, and disturb the household...

Tom,

One other small point on that awful Mark Twain ripoff.  Those fond of the
muddy flavor of catfish meat would seldom use crawfish as bait.  The river
cats are indeed bottem fish but seldom go after "agressive" baits like
crawfish.  They prefer worms and, indeed, "stinkballs".  In addition to
being terrible writing it did not even get the details right.

Cheers,
Hugh

If that's the last Desperado, for the reasons insinuated therein, you're
apt to have a lot of company updating your resume.  We're inventing new
forms of communication, are we?  I love it, I love it!  I always
wondered what we were doing....

And somebody out there obviously just didn't know the difference
between Mark Twain and Uncle Remus.

SUBJECT: SONNY MONOSSON "TESTIMONIAL"

For those of your who could not attend the DECworld press
reception, and for those of you who would like to reflect on the
unprecedented action which took place there, here is a transcript
of Sonny Monosson's impromptu remark at the podium before the
assembled worldwide press This followed Jack Shield's talk in
which he quoted from one of Sonny's newsletters.

"Fourteen months ago, when DEC was in the middle of all its
problems, I said that DEC had become a second tier computer
company.  In the last 14 months, I have watched DEC very, very
carefully.  They have overcome their administrative problems.  I
can attest to that.  Now, I get bills promptly.  They have made
very substantial progress in the reorganization of their company
to keep up with the stupendous, rapid growth that they've had.
These show - there are new people that have been brought in and
its working.  Most important(ly), they have made strides in
technology.  The superiority of its products, more important, the
inovation of its products - the fact that the products are really
here and can be used and sold and bought - have made them in a
class by themselves.  Consequently, I would humbly like to
re-phrase my previous quotation to the following:  DEC is the
number one computer company that is only number two in size."

Sonny Monosson, December 5, 1984.
