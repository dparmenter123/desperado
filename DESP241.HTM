        I was away in Spain two weeks in September, mostly in Madrid and
        environs with four days in Barcelona.

        Two dates hit you in the eye everywhere you go in Spain.

        1936 -- the beginning of the civil war and the beginning of the
        Franco regime.  Over and over you hear or see references to this
        or that admirable activity that suddenly ended in 1936 and didn't
        start again until the late 1970s.

        1492 -- not what you think.  The year that Isabela ran the Jews
        and Moors out of Spain.  Jews, Arabs, and Christians had lived
        together in Spain for 800 years, but by 1492 the Catholics were
        really feeling their oats and Isabela concluded it would be a good
        time to get rid of the Moors and Jews.  They were kicked out with
        only what they could carry.  Some were able to transfer liquid
        assets.  For this forced expulsion,  Isabela earned the title of
        "The Catholic" from the Pope himself.  Over and over you see or
        hear references to this or that admirable activity that suddenly
        ended in 1492 and never started again.

        Fernando hardly rates a mention and is certainly not "The
        Catholic".

        This scandal is severely testing my principle, as stated by Bill
        Russell, that all a performer owes the audience is a performance.

        Up until now, my biggest beef against the self-indulgent Woody had
        been his unbearably screechy and melodically inept clarinet
        playing on the soundtrack of "Sleeper".  Constantly.

        Then, of course, there was his proposition that he had something
        important to say about love and death.

     I read in the Boston Globe several days ago that Marilyn Quayle once had
labor induced for the purpose of making certain that the birth of her child
would not interfere with her taking the bar exam around the same time.  How's
that for Family Values?  It almost sounds like something the Republicans would
accuse Hilary Clinton of doing.

Regular readers of my office door will recall that Nashville mayor
Bill Boner, 45, got himself into trouble a year or two ago by
announcing his engagement to Traci Peel, 34, while he was still
married to his third wife.  Peel compounded the problem by telling all
to the Nashville Banner, including the fact that "Boner's passion"
could last seven hours.

Boner and Peel were eventually united in holy matrimony, but now comes
the sad news that they are getting divorced: Peel claims she has
photos of Boner's car parked outside the home of his third wife, but
was herself forced to admit that she and her boyfriend recently took
an out-of-state vacation.  Meanwhile, the judge presiding over the
divorce case turns out to be one of Peel's ex-boyfriends.

Note 3637.17                   "Cracking" knuckles                      17 of 17
INFACT::BEVIS "Beware the treacherous Eye of Terror" 42 lines  25-AUG-1992 21:54
                          -&lt; From extensive study... &gt;-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RE: .13

    Once (somewhere around the age 12 or 13), I actually took "inventory"
    and discovered I was able to crack every joint including every finger
    (both joints on each), every toe (certain ones "on demand", others
    required a recovery period), elbows and knees.  Vertebrae, being
    difficult to distinguish, I lumped into one big category.  The
    fixed-plate skull joint was, of course, excluded from this set of
    experiments.

    Note that there were certain joints that fell into the "auto-crack"
    category, requiring only slight flexing in certain positions, to
    achieve repetitive pops without external pressure.  Others (such as
    fingers, required steady pressure - or even mild impact - to produce a
    satisfactory result.

    Certain joints (notably the "big" toe), offer dual-mode cracking: the
    "normal" bend-over-and-apply-pressure; and the side-to-side-wiggle (be
    careful experimenting with the latter as you may discover why
    "clipping" is frowned upon in the NFL - things tend to permanently jump
    out of place).

    Still other joints are distiguished as flexion (vs compression) poppers
    - knees are better flexors while fingers are better compressors.

    Finally, there is a distinction to be made in the "clarity" of a
    popper, as some are sudden, loud explosions while others are silent
    (except to the pop-ee) and more accurately described as grinders
    (uppermost cervical vertabrae and oftentimes the mandibular joints).

    I can confirm the earlier notes debunking rumors of health problems,
    with 30+ years of personal (and detailed) study.  No arthritis or
    oversized knuckles to report.

    However, I have always wondered why I could cross the little toe of my
    left foot over the 4th toe of that foot as easily as crossing my
    fingers.  However, the right foot's little toe has almost no
    manueverability at all.  I am left handed.  Perhaps this means
    something?

        Reprinted with permission.  Someone immediately responded that he
        could crack everything Don Bevis named, but he could also crack
        his sternum!  This was from a discussion of what cracks when you
        crack your knuckles (gas) and is it harmful (no).

        So what parts of your body can you crack, wiggle, maneuver, wield,
        or manipulate that most folks can't?

Introduction

        There's only so much to say about what it's like in the field.
        It's not like engineering or like I imagine marketing to be.
        Sometimes I can't imagine a more demanding and less rewarding
        job than Sales Support for Digital Equipment Corporation.

        Except for teaching in the Public High Schools of America.

        Maybe you've heard, and maybe you've heardn't, but I'm off.
        Uncle Ken is giving me a juicy kiss on the forehead, and
        sending me off to become A Teacher, via the Engineers into
        Education Program.  My reasons are all the noble crap you've
        come to expect from me, so I won't ennumerate them.

        This issue of Off Center is dedicated to trying to capture
        things I may have learned while at Digital.  Right now, I
        know I've learned a lot.  I've also become a bit jaded, cynical,
        hopeful, and idealistic.

Aphorisms

        The only difference between Notes and Talk Radio is bandwidth.

        The potential for absurdity is directly proportional to the
        level of technology.

        In sales support, you should gamble with the work load.  Sales
        people ask you to do things.  A certain percentage of these
        things never happen.  With experience, you can ignore some of
        these tasks and still not look stupid (and be more productive!)

        Next time you go off to buy a car and you don't trust the
        salesman, remember that customers can't be trusted either.

        Keep a dictionary in your office.  Today I tried to use
        "prurient" instead of "prudent" and "amorphism" instead
        of "aphorism."

        Call people back right away, even if you have nothing to say
        to them.  I used to wait until I had something to say, and
        they had either forgotten the question or had new ones.  At
        any rate, they would be irritable.  If you call them back right
        away, they often have forgotten the question or have new ones,
        you haven't wasted your time, and they're happy.

        Make room in your office for sentimentality.  It's nice to
        have a potato head kid handy when you're feeling down.

        If you are in the wrong career, eventually you will do something
        that goes directly against your conscience.  Then, if you don't
        change, you will become right for the wrong career.

        There are a lot of nice things about wearing jeans and sandals
        to work.  There are some nice things about wearing a suit, too.
        Wearing jeans feels good.  Wearing a suit makes me feel good.

        If you tell a sales rep that you are going into teaching, they
        can usually tell you how to make money at it.

        Don't hide your resume.  Keep it up-to-date and out in the open.
        Have people review it.  If your resume is around, like a familiar
        dog, your manager won't be afraid when he or she sees it.

        If you have to make enemies, pick shy people.  They'll get you,
        but they won't make more enemies for you on the way.

        I think that if you don't trust someone who is trustworthy, you
        lose a lot more than if you trust someone who isn't.

        One of the best parts of the Sales Support job is calling
        someone and getting their voicemail, but just before you get
        voicemail you hear one to three notes of piped-in Muzak on
        the phone.  The fun part is trying to guess the song, and then
        calling back right away for confirmation.

        Keep personal things in your briefcase.  If a customer sees
        them they remember you're a real person.  And then they'll
        remind you that they are real people too.

        There is training and there is education.  At Digital, you often
        don't know which you'll get until the class begins.  Training,
        of course, you can use Monday morning back at work.  Education
        you can use sometime in the future for something, or maybe it
        was just interesting.

        There is a bug in DECwrite and in DECpresent that takes
        time-of-day into account.  These products crash most often
        between the hours of midnight and 6:00 A.M.

        Some people never initiate -- they're never the ones to call
        and make plans.  That's just the way they are.  Call them
        anyway, and don't be annoyed that they haven't called you.
        Write them letters two at a time and believe they love to get
        them.

        Any metric applied to a process will distort that process.
        Usually, the end result of the process is not fulfilling
        the intended goal, but fulfilling the metric.

        You know if something you've done is good.  People try my
        homebrew and tell me quite genuinely that it is horrible.  Hah!

        Every moment is of infinite importance.  Every moment is of
        no importance.

        Sometimes people get a job with a little authority and they
        become unbearable.  This is a wonderful opportunity!  I think
        they've gotten little respect in their lives -- just imagine
        what your respect means to them!

        If I've been working on a problem and I know the answer, but
        no one will listen to me, I lose ownership of the problem.  I
        don't care about it any more and find it difficult to work on.
        This is probably true of a lot of people.

        Careful!  You never know when you're going to meet the best
        friend you've ever had!

        It takes about three years for an engineer to get comfortable
        in a sales support role.  That's why we don't have any COD
        (Career Opportunity Days) people left in our office.  Sales
        people are used to shorter returns on investment.

        Don't break rules you don't understand.  No, That isn't it.
        Break rules that you understand to be silly.

        These are the only reasons for being embarrassed:  doing
        something you shouldn't be doing, and not taking other
        people into consideration.  Being wrong isn't embarrassing.
        Dropping a gallon of milk in the aisle at the grocery store
        isn't embarrassing.  Tearing your pants isn't embarrassing.

        If you can't understand someone, at least try to be amused
        by them.  You'll find out you like them and after awhile
        they won't be so mysterious.

A Wish

        I've got a terrible feeling that a lot of my dearest friends
        are going to be touched by this next layoff.  When sales and
        sales support got hit, it was difficult, but I don't think
        many of us think of Digital as "family" the way they do in
        engineering.  Most of us in the field work hard and do the best
        we can, but I think we're sacrificing for personal reasons, not
        for our "Digital Family."  This is not a family -- it is a
        corporation.

        Distinguish between all those wonderful warm people that you
        work with from the corporation.  Working hard for the benefit
        of your co-workers is noble and right, and deserves emotional
        investment.  Working hard for the corporation is what we
        get paid for, and if the corporation asks us to stop, that is
        what we must do.

        Remember this if you are laid off.  Your family isn't
        turning their back on you -- you are being fired by a cold,
        calculating, money-generating machine.  It's nothing personal.
        (Easy for me to say -- I'm laying myself off!)

        My wish is that if any of you gets laid off, that your ego
        stays intact.

Epilog

        A lot of this is probably stuff I've just learned from growing
        up.  It's a long way from 22 years old to 31 years old.

        Digital has changed in the last nine years.  I remember when
        Stan Rabinowitz left; he said he came to work for DEC, but
        was leaving Digital.  I didn't really see the changes coming
        like Stan did.  Digital has changed so much that most people
        don't even know who Stan is.  Some people don't even understand
        why the "User claims year 2000 should not be a leap year" SPR
        response is funny.

        From the field, it is pretty easy to see that Digital is just
        another corporation, since we get to look at so many other
        corporations.  Most corporations have noble charters and creeds
        they try to live by, giving to the United Way and taking an
        interest in the whole lives of their employees.  But what is
        always most important is the bottom line, the percentage of
        growth from one fiscal year to the next, and keeping Wall
        Street happy.

        But you all know that by now.

        Do I sound bitter?  Because I'm really not.  I worked hard,
        learned a lot, made some people suffer my presence, and now
        I'm leaving with a great opportunity.  Life goes on.  Somehow,
        I'll learn how to lick postage stamps.

My full name is Christopher Merrell Spellman.  (Merrell being an odd family
name, my wife misspelled it on our wedding invitations, but that's a
different  story.)  That is kind of long and one of the problems which I
typically run into  with it is that many computers do not allow 11 character
first names.  Most of  the time I come out as Christoph or Christophe.

*sarcasm on*

Now I can understand how this happens.  After all, I know *only* about 6
Christopher's personally.  If I were designing a database, I would look
around  at the names of the people I know and judge that there are so few
names longer  than 9 characters that *chopping* the name would be OK.  After
all, what  difference do a few letters make?

*sarcasm off*

Sometimes I do want to choke people.  (Particularly because I think that
they  are programming in COBOL.)

However, the best mangling of my name I ever encountered was when I applied
for  a library card at the Boston Public Library.  My name came back:

        Christphes Pellman

I wish I'd kept it.

A dear friend of my, Lloyd Botway (whom I have lost track of, so
any Desperati who know of him, please let me know, I'ld love to
get back in touch) was a system analyst for the University of
Missouri back when I was a bunny designer.  I remember seeing a
piece of mail addressed to Lloyd as a consequence of his filling
out a computerized questionaire.  He had, as requested, filled
out the name/title field as:

        Lloyd Botway, Systems Analyst

The mail, of course, was addressed to:

        Mr. Botway S. Anal

And remained so until the company folded.  Unfortunately they had
sold their mailing list, so he started getting mail with that
name from more and more people.  I often wondered if he EVER got
rid of that particular accident.

P.S.  When last heard from Lloyd was in Kansas City.

        At Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, ME, workers' Geiger
counter detected radiation in a hole they were drilling into a sealed
building once used to store nuclear weapons. Air Force officials
claim the source of the radiation in the abandoned nuclear
warehouse is radon in the soil. (Citizens Clearinghouse for

"Hello, CNN,
Get Me Rewrite"

        In a congressional hearing on April 8, a general from the U.S.
Missile Command defined an "intercept" as a "pass in the sky" when
the word referred to U.S. Patriot missiles and the Iraqi Scud missiles
they were supposed to destroy during the U.S. massacre of Iraq.
According to the General Accounting Office, in some cases the Army
reported more Scuds destroyed than Patriots fired. The GAO found
that the Patriots were successful only once, but an Israeli Air Force
expert testified that no Patriot ever destroyed an Iraqi missile. During
the hearing Rep. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) questioned why the hearing was
taking place. "We all saw the Patriot work on CNN," he said.

Get a Real Job...

        At the Los Alamos, New Mexico, National Laboratory,
birthplace of the hydrogen bomb, nuclear scientists met in February
to find nonmilitaristic projects to apply their skills to. A favorite one
was to develop ways to detect, intercept and bomb killer comets en
route to a collision with Earth. One scientist called for building a
fleet of 1,200 new missiles armed with the world's entire arsenal of
nuclear warheads.  Another scientist got so excited by the prospect
that he shouted from the back of the auditorium, "Nukes forever!"

Nukes in Space

        The Federation of American Scientists has revealed a secret
government plan to use rockets propelled by nuclear energy in the
Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") system. The plan amounts to
putting 100 nuclear reactors in orbit around the earth. When
launched and while in orbit, the rockets would release radiation in
their exhaust stream. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists,
if one of those rockets started to fly apart, it would spray radioactive
material over a wide area.  According to Helen Caldicott, M.D.,
another military space project, the Galileo space probe, contains
49.25 lb of plutonium, enough to give everyone on Earth a lethal
case of lung cancer if an accident occurred.  Galileo is scheduled to
fly low over the earth in December. (Native Americans for a Clean
Environment)

On the Road Again...

        For years a government nuclear weapons contractor, Martin
Marietta Energy Systems, altered shipping documents to conceal its
sending radioactive waste from the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak
Ridge, TN, nuclear weapons plant to 16 commercial incinerators.
Over 11 years, about 14 million pounds of uranium-contaminated oil
and sludge traveled from Oak Ridge to municipal trash incinerators
in Kansas, Alabama, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Through
the incineration process the radioactive material left the incinerator
smokestacks to blow over the 16 communities and remained behind
in the bottom ash to contaminate area dumps and ultimately the air,
soil, water and food chain, though corporate and governmental
officials claim no harm was done. (Arizona Daily Star)

It's Got to Go
Somewhere...

        Though property damage from Chicago's spring flood will
cost billions from repairs and lawsuits, the environmental damage is
incalculable.  When water cascaded from the river into the city's
underbelly, it carried with it toxics, including PCBs, that had settled
on the river bottom from years of corporate dumping. As it moved
along, the water carried off toxic waste from the subbasements and
sub-subbasements of downtown Chicago. The city then pumped the
water into a deep tunnel sewer, from which it went to a processing
plant and then into the Des Plaines River. The contaminated water
then flowed into the Illinois River and finally into the Mississippi, the
source of drinking water for people all the way south to New
Orleans. (In These Times)

Nuke it Healthy

        Food treated with cobalt 60, a radioactive waste product from
nuclear power plants, is now for sale in U.S. supermarkets, thanks to
the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration and the country's first
commercial food irradiation plant. Vindicator of Florida, Inc., applies
gamma radiation to fruit and vegetables to prolong shelf life, destroy
insects and dirt and lengthen ripening time. Besides produce,
poultry, pork, spices, nuts, tea and wheat flour have all received
FDA approval for radiation treatment. Irradiating food might be good
for food industry profits, but it isn't for public health. Walter
Burnstein, M.D., chair of the food safety consumer group Food and
Water, claims that although irradiating food doesn't leave it
radioactive, cancer-causing free radicals (chemicals) and harmful
molds remain in the food from the irradiation process. Irradiation
also destroys some vitamins. The environmental hazards of
transporting and using cobalt 60 are another problem.  Organically
grown foods are a special target of irradiation advocates.  Sam
Whitney, Vindicator's president, says the FDA's view is that "the food
they sell in health stores is the most dangerous food in America.
This health food stuff has cow shit and chicken shit on it and bugs."
