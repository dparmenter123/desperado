Subject: Official Desperado Seasons mentioned in #1004

Your official Desperado seasons reminded me of something I always
proclaimed back in college, namely, that the new day begins when you
get up in the morning, not at midnight. It was just easier this way.
For example, everybody always spoke of going out partying Saturday night
until 4:00 AM, or being out late Saturday night, or a late night on the
town, etc., not an early morning. An early morning refered to those horrible
days when you had to drag yourself out of bed before 9. Basically, it
is night until you go to bed, the day magically changes while you sleep,
and you wake up in the morning of a brand new day. Much more convienient
than having to deal with day changes in the middle of normal activities!!

It also seemed to me that the sale of beer in 24 hr. supermarkets in up state
N. Y. (where I went to college) followed this scheme. It was illegal
to sell beer from somewhere around 6:00 AM Sunday until around noon
(I don't remember the exact hours). Therefore beer was always available
for Saturday night parties, however late they ran. You could not buy
it Sunday morning when you were usually asleep anyway, but it was
available again Sunday afternoon.

Maybe this is what Margery Goldstein had in mind.

Hi, Tom.  I've got a few amusing stories below which you may want to
send out to ease afternoon tensions for the other DESPERADOS...

1.
  The day before Thanksgiving, we were putting TU78's on VAXWRK.  While
bantering around with our Field Service rep, I asked him:
  "Why don't DEC Field Service people celebrate Thanksgiving?"
And after shaking his head that he didn't know, I told him:
  "Because cannibalism is illegal in this country."
He chuckled and then remarked:
  "What have they got to be thankful for anyway?"

  The following mail is an explantion of what had allegedly been a "serious,
mysterious problem in VMS when migrating from RSX to VMS, using BASIC."

Subj:   File and forget

        In our last episode of "Adventures in VMS" we met an ISAM file created
on an 11M system. When read on VMS, some component of VMS was allegedly doing a
Shift Eight Bytes And Misalign. Well, it turns out that there was a bug in the
user program. (I know it's hard to believe, but users do make mistakes.)
        Due to a minor coding error, the user program was doing a Convert
Double To Single Precision With Total Loss of Accuracy. This quaint construct
was implemented in a rather simple fashion: write all floating point variables
as double precision; read them as single precision. This explains why things
were showing up multiples of four bytes too soon.
        The moral of the story is that the relationship between accuracy and
precision is not necessarily linear.

        Tune in next time for the saga of the Line Printer that did not rewind
the ribbon on dismount. For those of you who would like to do some background
reading, the associated mount command is:

  While discussing a problem involving tape drives on our 11/750, a colleague
bemoaned the fact that we only have a TS11:
  "It'd be nice to have some real tape drives on the 750.  Then we could take
the TS11 out and use it for a boat anchor."
  After thinking about it, he further remarked:
  "With our luck, it would probably float!"

anything too inappropriate.  (He told us that he was keeping himself
clean so his probation officer wouldn't have him sent to jail.)

There is a non-DEC software package called LOCK-11 that is supposed to
increase the security of RSTS/E systems.  The vendor was offering a
$300 reward to anyone who cracked it.  Mitnick did, and collected.

Subject: A request and a kludge

1) Does anyone out there know of a version of LOGO that runs on VMS?

2) For the growing DESPERADO catalog of DCL kludges, here is a way to get
DCL to recognize special function keys intermixed with commands.  The method
takes advantage of the fact that the &lt;ESC&gt; key is a line terminator for DCL
and that the VT100 can send an answer-back message which, for this to work,
must consist of s single carriage return.  The same procedure will work on
non-answer-back terminals (e.g., GIGIs) but you have to hit a &lt;RETURN&gt; after
each special key.  How inelegant.

The following article is from SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE, December 1982.  In
light of the recent interest of the CMU campus computing strategies, I
thought that enet readers may find this information useful.

         I B M  a n d  C a r n e g i e - M e l l o n
            s i g n  j o i n t  a g r e e m e n t

     International  Business  Machines  Corp.    and   Carnegie-Mellon
University  have  teamed  up  to develop what they believe will be the
most comprehensive computing environment at any university anywhere  -
a  prototype  distributive computing system designed to give every CMU
student  and  faculty  member  direct  access  to   the   university's
information resources.

     The goal of the three year program is to lay the  foundation,  in
equipment   and   programming   for   computer   work   stations   and
communications services.  By  1986,  several  thousand  personal  work
stations for the university's staff, faculty and 5500 students will be
in place, CMU officials predict.  The development effort will build on
existing  software  research  done  by  the CMU Department of Computer
Science,  but  with  "transitional"  hardware  while   IBM   completes
development of an as yet unannounced system for the CMU project.

     To help students and faculty members get  experience  in  working
with  personal workstations, a substantial number of existing machines
will be brought into the university in Pittsburg, Pa.  over  the  next
two years.

     6 8 0 0 0 - b a s e d  w o r k s t a t i o n

     Currently  under  evaluation  as  the  transition  machine  is  a
workstation  with  a  68000-based  16-bit  processor  and a bit-mapped
graphic display, produced by the IBM Instruments Division.  Initially,
over 100 transition machines are expected to be available on campus in
the fall of 1983, in dormitories, in laboratories, classrooms and  the
library,   growing  to  several  hundred  over  the  next  few  years.
Software, including an editor and text processing facilities, will  be
developed  at  the  CMU  Computation  Center  to  function with a Unix
operating  system.   it  is  expected  that  Fortran,  Pascal,  and  C
programming  languages will be supported.  The transition machines are
expected to be replaced by 1985 with IBM 32-bit systems with up  to  1
Mbyte  of  memory.   Other  features  of  the  '85  system  will  be a
bit-mapped display and graphics tablet with electronic "mouse."  Voice
input  capability  is  under  consideration  for  the  updated IBM/CMU
system.

     Rather than using built-in disk storage, clusters of  50  to  100
workstations  will  share  a file server through a local area network;
the clusters will be linked together and to the university's mainframe
computers  through  a backbone network.  Under the current plan, users
will be able to access any files from any workstation in the network.

     While the transition system  is  implemented  and  evaluated,work
will  begin  within a CMU-IBM Infomation Technology Center on software
developments.   During  the  evaluation  period,  IBM  will  work   on
networking and it's advanced workstations.

     Richard M.   Cyert,  president  of  Carnegie-Mellon,  says  CMU's
objective is to begin deploying all elements of the expanding computer
environment, including a new operating system for distributed personal
computing,  in  late  1985.  "By 1991," Cyert says, "we expect to have
about 7500 personal workstations, each with its own powerful  computer
and  graphics  display,  all interconnected through a high speed local
area  network.   In   addition   to   communications   between   every
workstation, there will be a unified data file and a central computing
facility available to all workstations.  Our objective  is  to  expand
this  computing  system  and  support network for faculty and students
beyond the CMU campus to the  greater  Pittsburg  area  through  cable
television or telephone lines."

     The Information Technology Center will be staffed by 10  IBM  and
23  CMU  personnel.  The agreement also expresses the intent of IBM to
continue it's support through 1987,  based  on  the  progress  of  the
project.

     IBM will provide funds and equipment for the center  expected  to
top $20 million over the first three years of the program.

     Although the initial program  centers  on  work  to  be  done  at
Carnegie-Mellon, the agreement with IBM provides for the establishment
of a consortium of universities, with each  university  designating  a
person  as  primary liason with the CMU-IBM project.  Regular meetings
will be scheduled as elements of the program become operational.

If castigation was intended in re: my overzealous appearance of expertise on
Indians, consider it accepted...  Anyway, the difference(s) between the Eski-
mo and the classic American Indian are:

1.  Eskimos are generally short and stocky, usually having heights in the 1.5-
    to-1.6 meter range.  American Indians, with the notable exception of the
    Seminoles, are usually much taller and relatively lean.

2.  Some Eskimos have wavy hair; the pure American Indian strain always has
    straight hair.

3.  The Eskimos seem to have a fair population with type-B blood; this type is
    extremely rare among the Indians.

4.  The Eskimos have a unique language, not allied to any other know language.

Most of the above information was dug out of my trivial mind (strike that,
read "mind full of trivia"); the rest is courtesy of Collier's Encyclopedia.

Mike Vosbury's description if "Indian burn" reminds me of the more painful form
employed by schoolboys when I was one:  place the hands around the victim's
wrist, with the thumbs adjacent to each other.  Apply enough pressure to
guarantee good friction.  Rotate the hands in opposite directions...

I would recommend making the OED the "official" Desperado dictionary; under-
stand, however, that there is a certain British bias therein.  American
Heritage does tend to be faddish and incomplete.

OED (Oxford English Dictionary) is the official Desperado dictionary,
with able assistance from Webster's New Collegiate.  No castigation
intended, by the way, but a professional anthropologist once told me
that the difference was that Eskimos were not Indians, but Indians were.

Boy, this burns me up!!!  I hope (but doubt) that someone in power reads
this semi-periodically published epistle, and takes some corrective action
(are you a Desparado, K.O. ?).

At a party this weekend, I struck up a conversation with a neighbor who,
for the sake of anonymity,  I'll call Ms. Lats (Lady Across The Street).
Ms. Lats works for a local municipality who has tentatively approved funds
for a small computer system, pending the receipt of an estimate on the cost
of a system deemed adequate for her needs.

Ms. Lats called our "main" number in Maynard, and said that she would like
to be put in touch with someone who could meet with her to discuss her appli-
cation, tell her what she needs to buy, and how much it'll cost.  After
several transfers, she was put in touch with the office of what she thinks
was a district sales rep, who was to call her back, and hasn't.  After re-
peatedly calling the sales office, they have yet to call her back.

        Ms. Lats expressed little surprise when I told her our
        salaries have been frozen because sales are off.

While our sales people indulge in decadent bacchanals in celebration of
themselves, customers with money in hand and a finite level of patience
are going elsewhere.

In this instance, the situation can be remedied merely by having our sales
people do what they are expected to do.

In general, I think our sales approach is going to have to be more attuned
to the times around us.  Personal computers are being marketed like appliances,
i.e., in attractive stores where you can lay down cash and walk home with
something.  I think to stay competitive, we should look at selling our larger
systems as office appliances, where a small businessman can walk into a nice
showroom, see the stuff, and get quick answers and demos.

This is exactly how Ms. Lats bought her Trash-80 for her home, and doesn't
understand why she can't to the same with an 11/23.   She thought the various
Digital Computer Stores that exist are probably fine if you live in downtown
Boston or San Francisco, but don't do much good for anybody else.  If there's

At the risk of being excoriated for being a figurative illiterate, I
would like to point out that the phrases "I could care less" and
"More than likely" are more than hackneyed and less than successfully
ironic.

I wonder if other Desperados have any favorite phrasal candidates for
oblivion?

Well, I won't excoriate you, Dennis.  I gave that up after I
matriculated, but I think our language is made up of letters, words, *and*
groups of words.  Some of these we consider hackneyed cliches, others
we don't even notice.  "I could care less" serves the valuable
function of annoying literal-minded people who think it should be "I
couldn't care less" and "more than likely" feels like a fairly usable
idiom to me.  I am, as always, willing to entertain further debate.

1) It is a good thing that we don't tie ourselves too closely with
   sales to DOD. Around 10 years ago, Raytheon did the majority of
   their business that way. They went through a few difficult years
   during which they released thousands of engineers. About that time
   they also got a new CEO who saw the wisdom of diversification. Today
   their DOD revenue is down to under 35% and all-in-all they are a
   healthier company.

   Another reason is that margins are lower when dealing with the
   govt. They DEMAND the lowest price at which you sell to your best
   customers, but they themselves do not feel obligated to act like
   one of them. Within the last 18 months, DEC was publicly accused
   of overcharges, based upon that philosophy. Our response (supported
   by several others named in the accusation) was that doing business
   with the govt incurs greater overhead than with private industries,
   hence the difference in pricing structures.

2) So you can run VM370 on top of itself -- big deal!! Richie Larry
   did the same thing with OS8 years ago. He did it in less than 8GB
   of memory and still had enough CPU cycles left to do real time.
   Trying to do real time through the layers of IBM software stated
   would be like trying to sustain A/D sampling at 10KHZ through RTEM,
   running on the RSX AME, running on VMS, running on a 730.

I really enjoyed this. Cheers.

I heard a good story - allegedly even true - when I worked for manufacturing.
It seems that a couple of years ago, the Navy bought a number of 11's - some-
thing like 8 11/40's, I think.  The catch:  They had to be IDENTICAL.  The
FA&amp;T (Final Assembly and Test) plant that worked on them had to clear out
enough space to line them all up.  Switches on the front panels had to be
exchanged because of slight variations in color.  Every board had to be of
exactly the same revision level - and probably every part on each copy of
each board on all the machines had to come from the same vendor.  Every time
a problem showed up on one of the machines - as they always due, that's why
there's a T in FA&amp;T - you had to run through all the machines to make sure
that any replacement part you put in was no different from the other machines.

As I recall, the person who told this story claimed to have worked on the
damn things.  They were at it for weeks.

And, in answer to the obvious question:  He didn't know WHY the Navy wanted
8 completely identical 11/40's; they probably wouldn't say.  But they were
willing to pay for them...

Your funny headlines mail has got to me. How about this one. It appeared, I am
told, in a west coast newspaper some years back when Nixon was still president.

The reference is to a price freeze on meat.
