||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
This is from David B. Wilson, the Globe's "conservative" in-house
columnist.  He was writing about Cheap Chic, i.e. bragging about how
little you spend on heating your house, etc.  The quote:

        "A four-cylinder 1983 Japanese car is an ingenious vehicle
         indeed; but compared to a 1956 Oldsmobile 98 Starfire it
         scarcely qualifies as an automobile."

This is correct.

Any desperados out there know where "all the bells and whistles" comes from?
Stephen spent the evening searching through all the various Dictionaries of
This and That, and couldn't find any clues.  We think it might be from steam
lore (railroads, steamboats, etc.) but can't find any real clues as to where
the phrase comes from.  Perhaps it originated in DEC committee meetings, where
it's heard most frequently!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I think HARDY::SIVA::WARBURTON may be right.  However, an alternative
explanation is that it is a reference to the trap drummer, who must
provide all the sound effects in a band in addition to his role as
timekeeper.

UMass's call letters may actually be to avoid the obvious embarrassment
of sound like an undependable news source for Barbara Walters:  WUMA.

My favorite road sign comes from my youthful travels through
Georgia and Tennessee.  The signs were billboards placed a quarter
mile or so in front of what were then known as filling stations that
had little diners inside:

                EAT HERE, GET GAS.

Speaking of WOOF in Hoople, North Dakota -- the station is probably a figment
of Prof. Peter Schickele's fertile imagination, as La Eppes indicated.  The
university undoubtedly is, too.  But Hoople and Zap and all the other North
Dakota communities mentioned on the record ("P.D.Q. Bach on the Air") surely
do exist.

North Dakota jokes are very much in vogue in Montana now, but I can't recall
any offhand.  Lucky for Granite Staters and Little Rhodies that people in
Massachusetts have too much important work to do and thus can't be bothered
making jokes about our l'il neighbors.

Subject: Ma Bell area codes.

Area code assignments are not quite random, at least at the low end of
the numbers.  Area codes which took less time to dial (remember dial
phones?) and to transmit with mechanical switches were assigned to
regions with high population and large numbers of business phones.

Area codes all have 0 or 1 as a middle digit, and anything but 0 or 1
as the first and last digits.  Thus the shortest area code to dial is
212.  Not peculiarly, this is assigned to New York City.  The next
two, 213 and 312, are Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively.  313 is
Detroit.  412 is Pittsburgh; 214 I can't find just glancing at my
phone book.  215 is Philadelphia; 512 is San Antonio.  314 is St.
Louis; 413, western Massachusetts (a ringer!); 414 Milwaukee; 415 San
Francisco; and so forth.  It works for the first few anyway, and that
really was the reasoning.  Bell Labs published a great deal of
justification about this ordering ten or fifteen years ago.

Think of all the millions of little clicks that were saved by having
NYC, LA, and Chicago at the top of the list!  Oh, thank you, Bell Labs!

By the way, area codes are not exactly static.  Those of you who have
suffered through a change of zip code (e.g., anyone in Nashua, NH)
or a change of phone number (anyone who has ever worked at DEC) can
imagine how a change of area code traumatizes an entire city. The area
code for San Diego changed last week.

Well, I got several emergency calls from people out there doing a
benchmark.  They left messages containing this peculiar area code, to
wit, 619.  I discovered almost instantly that DEC's clever centrex
system--the little computer you get when you dial 8 that tries to put
your call on a cheap WATS line if possible--did not know about 619.
As of ten minutes ago, by the way, it still doesn't.  It won't until
February, according to the phone company.  Ah, technology.

WGST was the commercial station, which used to be owned by GaTech but was
operated for profit by professionals.  Georgia Tech sold the station some
10-12 years ago, and it has now moved to quarters away from campus.  It is
now an all news station (except when broadcasting Tech games).

WREK was (and is) the non-profit, FM, student station.

That:

Yes, the area codes were initially assigned to reduce OPERATOR and NETWORK
work time.  The low digits at the beginning and end served both needs.  The
middle digit obeyed a different rule, more closely coupled to OPERATOR work
time than NETWORK work time:  If there was only one area code in a state,
that state had a middle digit of zero.

Since that assignment the network has grown and new assignments have had no
reason to observe the old rules.

The requirement that the middle digit of an area code be a one or zero will
be eliminated some time in the next 40 years, as the available ones which
do follow that format are used up.  Only ten remain, and two of those are
going into service within the next two years (New York City and Los Angeles).
San Diego just got a new area code three weeks ago, but calls will complete
both ways for a couple of months.

Don't scoff at IBM's 370-on-a-chip.  Remember that the original version of CMS

IBM had a version of CMS partly running on their 5110 desktop computer.  The
operating system disk was a single RX02-style floppy.  CMS can run almost any
DOS or OS application.  The user interface is the closest thing to a decent
interactive programming environment that IBM has.  If IBM comes out with this
as an addition to their PC, we're going to have a hard time selling Pro-350's.

             RIT SELECTS DIGITAL'S PERSONAL COMPUTER

ROCHESTER, NY --November 16, 1982 -- Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT) today took another significant step toward
becoming a national educational leader in the utilization of
computers.
    The Board of Trustees of the 153-year-old university approved
Monday a plan to offer personal computers to students, faculty
and staff at a substantial reduction in cost, and to develop a
campus-wide network to support them.  "The agreement we've
entered into with the Digital Equipment Corporation will offer
the RIT community high quality computer equipment that can be
tailored to meet individual needs.  Now and in future years it
will mean that members of this institution will have access to
state-of-the-art computer technology that will fit any area of
specialization," say RIT President M. Richard Rose.
    Students and RIT employees will have a comprehensive range of
Digital equipment to choose from, including the Professional 325,
the Professional 350 and the DECmate II.  An array of software
packages also will be available.  The agreement calls for Digital
to use the RIT campus as a research model for a new networking
system that will be capable of linking all personal computers to
each other and to other computing facilities on campus.
    "Digital's interest in working with RIT as a model for
computer research will have an energizing effect on our efforts
to achieve some of our educational goals," comments Dr. Robert
Quinn, RIT vice president for Academic Affairs and the architect
of RIT's computer expansion.
    "Last year all of our faculty made a commitment to become
computer literate.  We are well ahead of schedule in reaching
that goal.  We also intend to have the utilization of
sophisticated computer hardware and software as an integral part
of the RIT educational experience," Quinn adds.
    The Institute also will offer financing plans for the
purchase, leasing, or leasing with the option to buy the
computers.  In addition, RIT will operate a maintenance and
repair service.
    A $4,800 hardware and software Digital system, for example,
will be available for approximately $2,800.  Students living on
campus will be offered the option of jointly leasing computer
equimpent, further reducing costs.  The voluntary purchasing or
leasing of computers by students will be entirely  separate from
and will not affect tuition costs.
    Students financially unable to afford the new computer
equipment will have access to personal computers through an
existing laboratory.  Quinn says that, in spite of these
difficult economic times, RIT will provide maximum access through
this innovative plan.
    "This new effort correlates with our other recent
announcements in the field of computing, including our computer
literacy requirements for students and faculty, our $4.2 million
computer acquisition, and the initiation of the nation's first
undergraduate program in microelectronic engineering," explains
Rose.
    "The fact that we have one of the largest undergraduate
programs in computer science and technology in the nation is just
part of the story.  We plan to offer everyone, from the student
studying art to the individual studying business, the opportunity
to own a highly sophisticated personal computer.  This will have
a significant positive impact on the educational environment of
RIT," he adds.
    According to Digital's Joel Schwartz, marketing vice
president, Personal Computer Group, "As a widely recognized
university, committed to the advancement of computer science, it
is fitting that we announce the first of such agreements here
today with RIT.  It marks, we believe, the beginning of a new era
in that the benefits of personal computing will be available on
an individual level to every member of the RIT community.
    "We applaud the foresight show here, and are genuninely
excited about the potential this agreement represents both here
in Rochester as well as throughout the entire educational
sphere."
    RIT is a multi-faceted university in upstate New with nine
colleges.  It offers more than 200 options in its professional
career program.  A national leader in cooperative education, a
program that alternates academic work with paid experience in
business and industry, RIT enrolls 16,000 students.
    Digital Equipment Corporation, headquartered in Maynard, MA,
is second in the world in computer sales based upon its reported
operating revenues of $3.9 billion for its 1982 fiscal year.  The
company is a leading supplier of information management systems
for office, factory, and laboratory automation, personal
computing and small business.  There are currently more than
one million Digital terminals running on Digital computers doing
word processing and electronic mail.

        "Well Igor, what have we here? A new version of software?" snickered
        the evil villain, Kreigh-fish, "Looks like we'll have to push this
        thru the ringer a few times"

        "AH, AH, AH, Yes master, lets do terrible things to it!" moaned Igor
        as he slid his drooling hunchbacked body towards the distribution
        tapes"

        It grew darker, and the installation proceded at a feverish pace.
        Flashing lights could be seen from the laboritory window as Igor
        and Kreigh-fish tryed out their new monster.

        "Igor???!!!! What the hell is going on here??!!!" cried Kreigh-fish
        as the system puked all over itself, "This thing can't handle 618
        terminals and all sorts of deviant software, Those fools are trying
        my good nature and patence! Bring up the old software, and lets get
        even!!!!"

        The first strike of Kreigh-fish occured in downtown Virtual City.
        A computer stole $35,000 from the First Virtual Bank, leaving no
        clues other than a scattered series of dots all over the CRT of the
        banks central computer system.

        Commissoner Mcleod was called called to the scene. "Has anyone touched
        this terminal??" he asked, as he studied the CRT more closely.

        "Steve Parks, Junior systems programmer at your service" replied the
        computer operator on duty, "This is exactly what it looked like when
        I came to work this morning - and there was this print-out in the
        line printer this morning."

        Commissoner Mcleod studied the print-out. "What bank did this fund
        transfer go to??"

        "One on the east coast, two hours ahead of us, two hours before we
        were able to detect the robbery" replied Steve, "The money was then
        taken out by someone there and taken away - Its gone."

        The Commissioner thought for a moment. "This is a Job for VAXMAN and
        the boy wonder, RSX"

                                                To be continued....

        The Attack of the killer Kreigh-fish

        Chapter 2, Somewhere deep in the heart of Virtual city.

        A beeper sounds and awakens Gene Hoffman and an un-named evening
        guest. A cheery "What the HELL??" in uttered as a wandering hand
        reaches up to find the OFF button on his screaching beeper.

        Data from a distant center is taken and Gene returns the call.

        "Hello, this is super star Gene, No question too hard to solve on
        the first try" stated a moderately buzzed Gene as he stumbled over
        to the bed.

        "Why hello Gene" said the voice on the other end of the phone, "I'm
        having a ...."

        And before the voice had a chance to say anything else, Gene popped
        in and replied "Oh yeah, thats a known problem, and the only thing
        to do in this case is apply these 867 patches that effectively turn
        your huge computer system into a limited capability 4 function
        calculator."

        "BUT BUT BUT" muttered the voice on the other end of the telephone
        line.

        "You don't need to thank me" replied Gene proudly, "I'll get a SEMI-
        TRUCK out in the morning to deliver the patches to you. Unfortunately
        these patches are not on any kind of computer media like a tape or
        anything, You'll have to type them all in by hand. Well good-night!"
        And Gene hung up the phone and plopped back in bed.

        A voice cooed "Who was that Gene?", Gene replied back "Huh? Who was
        what?" and Gene promptly fell asleep.

        Deep in the laboritory of Kreigh-fish, Igor scurries about as his
        master turns blue in the face.

        "Just what does that fool take me for, All I wanted to know was
        how to load a tape on to my tape drive" stated Kreigh-fish, "This
        action is intolerable -- Igor, prepare the network for another
        bank job"

                                                to be continued
