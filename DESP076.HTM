HAMBURG -- West German scientists have developed a POCKET-SIZE
"supernavigator" that will tell anyone carrying it where on
earth he is -- within a 100 meter radius.

Prof. Guenter Seeber of the Institute for Geodesy at Hanover
University introduced the instrument at a meeting here of the
International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.

Based on an American instrument for military use, the "super-
navigator" works with the help of the US satellite system.

Seeber said it could eventually supersede the compass and other
navigational instruments when it is marketed in about 1990.

Last Monday, some friends from Pennsylvania (a couple in their early 60's)
arrived at the front desk at ZK and asked for me.  I used to work with the
husband at CONRAIL in ALLENTOWN, PA.

Apparently the Bullocks (that's their name) make an annual pilgrimage to New
England to visit the wife's relatives in ANDOVER, MA., and to climb MT
WASHINGTON with a retired CONRAIL exec who lives on a farm near WHITE RIVER
JUCTION, VT.

Over drinks at the TARA, the Bullocks recounted the following "true story":

They were on their way to their friend's farm last Sunday morning when they
saw a roadside sign on a backroad:

Well, it so happens that Mike Bullock and his wife "love to eat fresh peas"
while driving along the road, and Mike LOVES pancakes... So they decided to
stop and indulge themselves.

When they arrived at the roadside stand, "an old man with white hair" was just
opening up (it was about 8:00 am).

"How much are your peas?"

"75 cents a pound."

"We'll take three pounds."

"Well, I'll need to pick the peas... should take about 20 minutes.  Why don't
 you go over to the house and taste my wife's pancakes?  They're real good.
 She used to serve them to the state legislature..."

"OK.  I LOVE homemade pancakes."

They finished their pancakes.  Then Mike remarked to the hostess: "Your husband
said you used to serve your pancakes to the state legislature?"

"That's right.  When my husband was governor, we used to have delegations down
here all the time..."

Just then, Mel Thompson marches in with three pounds of fresh peas in a little
cardboard container marked "CUBE MOUNTAIN FARM"...

By the way, if any of you are interested, you can buy a copy of Mel's book,
LIVE FREE OR DIE, for $10.95, and he'll autograph it for you... Just get off
Insterstate 91 at the ORFORD exit (route 25) and drive down to the vegetable
stand at Cube Mountain Farm...

As a result of the the New Hampshire state police operation SPITE (state
police intensified traffic enforcement) one of our coworkers received a
warning for going 67 on the Everett Turnpike this morning.  The trooper
said that the operation is part of the federal government's (actually, he
said "President Reagan's") nationwide effort to enforce the 55 mph limit.

On the warning notice:

    The primary goal of the New Hampshire State Police Operation SPITE,
    is to save lives -- yours included!"

... And I had thought that spite implied malicious ill will.

On the subject of terminals with transposed backslash and line feed
keys: VT102's (and maybe some others) have a Set-Up option that controls
whether these keys are in their normal positions or are interchanged.
This latter is called 'word processing' layout for some reason.

Of course, sanity requires that you select the Set-Up setting that
corresponds to yer actual physical keyboard layout... you can sort-of
switch the keycaps around, but it's not too satisfactory since the
caps are dissimilar in profile, being on different rows.

How come I know things like this but don't know anything interesting?

About Tesla: just this very today I bought a copy of "Radio-electronics"

One facet of the acrimonious AC/DC debate was this: When it was time to bring
high tech to penology--the electric chair, that is--Steinmetz and Edison began
lobbying ferociously for their favorite currents. I believe that Steinmetz (AC)
won out despite the fact that he was a dwarf. The system worked as well as most
field test products: They succeeded in executing the prisoner, but only after
two jolts. (They'd figured the necessary voltage incorrectly, probably because
human bodies are so nonlinear.) There was much gasping, retching, and
expression of Victorian disgust in the execution chamber, not confined to the
prisoner. Fortunately, the prisoner was indeed guilty and unrepentant and was
not a framed-up Renaissance man like Rubin Carter. A papparazzo was on hand
(from those wonderful people who brought you the Spanish-American War), with a
high-tech miniature camera strapped to his ankle, to record the event. You push
the button, we'll do the rest.

I hesitate to say whether this should be added to Tesla's long list of
accomplishments, because maybe my memory doesn't serve me well, and Edison won
out. If I'm wrong, my apologies to Tesla fans; I'm sure his system would have
worked the first time, like all his other prototypes. Even if I'm wrong, it's
been pointed out already that Edison got better press than Tesla, so he doesn't
need this one.

Meanwhile, Mark Twain was still writing good stuff (almost lost his ass
investing in a new high-tech typesetting machine, though), Scott Joplin was at
work with low-tech musical instruments, and Clarence Darrow was beginning to
form different ideas about humane law. This is to say nothing of Emma Goldman,
who apparently was unimpressed with arc lighting and other high-tech goodies:

        There is only one revolution! There is only one flame trying
        to light the hideous darkness of life on Earth!

Klick, his relatives are Corich and Marich.

I'm thankful to have an accomplished American Croatian like Tesla to pull out
of a hat. Other than him, I only have Mike Bilandic and Dennis Kusinich

Reading about the great war between Tesla and Edison over AC vs. DC power
reminds be of a variation which I heard several years ago.  In this version,
George Westinghouse was the proponent of AC, with good old Tom once again
on the DC end.  It seems that one of Edison's arguments against AC was that
it was more dangerous than DC.  At one point during the debate he suggested
that since the French had named their famous beheading device after its
major proponent, M. Joseph Guillotine, perhaps we should call the electric
chair The Westinghouse!

Having recently moved to an apartment in Somerville, I am now learning
to cope with the differences between a blue collar neighborhood and
the pastoral bliss I relinquished in Nashua:  screaming children,
loudly idling autos in the driveway next to my bed room, and an insmoniac
landllady who more often than not gives the impression that she is
rehearsing a three-ring buffalo circus at 2 A.M.  Fear not, age brings
patience and, if not understanding, then resignation.

Last night, just before retiring, I was confronted by my heretofore
unannounced roommate -- a small rodent -- who was equally startled
when I broke in on his (or her) dash across the kitchen and rapid
disappearance somewhere near the sink.  Now far be it from me to make
pronouncements about the rights heaven's creatures to have a decent place
to live.  But I haven't had a single contribution toward the rent since I
arrived, which is categorically undemocratic.

I have therefore, decided, to evict the intruder post haste.  Problem
is, you see, I've never before had to perform such unpleasant duties.

              CANTABS:  CAN'T BEAT 'EM, SO BIRTH 'EM

(CAMBRIDGE, <b>August 12</b>) -- Cambridge Cantab team management doesn't
believe in making hollow promises.

Last winter, team owners <b>Jonathan Ostrowsky and Celeste Ronciglione,</b>
discouraged by the 'tabs recent performance in the Baby League,
vowed to grow their own talent at home, rather than continue their
policy of investing in free agents.  Today, they proudly displayed
the first dividend of their new policy.

<b>Tess Elizabeth Ostrowsky</b>, this year's rookie of the year in the Womb
League, was introduced to Baby League correspondents at an impromptu
<b>6:40 P.M.</b> press conference at Boston's <b>Beth Israel Hospital</b>.  The
<b>9 pound, 6 ounce</b> slugger was immediately assigned
Number 8, and will be given a shot at the starting shortstop job,
Owner/General Manager Ostrowsky indicated.

Ostrowsky professed to be unconcerned by reports of the midget mauler's
fielding deficiencies.  "Maybe she can't go to her left," Ostrowsky
conceded, "but she can't go to her right, either."

Team co-owner and manager Ronciglione, who reportedly spent the entire
nine-month Womb League season working with the rookie, is just glad
the young infielder is finally with the Big Club.  "We had hoped to have
her available to us in early July," she noted, "but then her team made
the playoffs, and we had to wait until now to get her on the roster."

Reporters noted an uncanny resemblance to the team's owners in the rookie,
who has reddish/blonde hair and a face like an angel.
