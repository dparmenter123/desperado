So here it is, Patriot's Day, and being patriotic, I've come to
work.  Unfortunately, I have frittered away the morning thinking
up movie titles.

        o  On the Beach Blanket Bingo

        o  A Patch of Blue Lagoon (or Hawaii)

        o  Dick &amp; Jane Eyre

        o  The French Lieutenant's Woman of the Year

        o  The Meaning of Life With Father

        o  We of the Never Never on Sunday

        o  Table for Five Easy Pieces

        o  It Happened One Night of the Living Dead

        o  Bad Boys in the Band

These aren't exactly kosher, but they're close:

        o  An Officer and a Gentlemen Prefer Blondes

        o  Marathon Manhattan

        o  High Road to China Syndrome

May 2nd issue.  I thought you might get a kick out of his baseball
qoute of the spring, by Jim Wohlford, an outfielder who was traded
by the Giants to the Expos during the winter:

"Ninety per cent of the game is half mental."

the police to arrest a person who refused to identify himself is
unconstitutional.

The court said that the law permitted the police to decide who

Subject: Does Desperado have a Personals section?

The following appears in the PERSONALS section of the latest issue of
National Review.  (The Personal ads in that magazine are, for the most
part, the dullest reading since the BLISS-32 Language Guide, but
occasionally, there's a gem.)

        My partner, who does not know I am doing this, is WASP,
        widowed, witty, articulate, elegant, charming, straight and
        50.  He is also hostile to any opposing opinion, and there
        is room in his vast hostility for every bureaucrat
        everywhere, most activities of government, some complete
        countries with all therein, and dark unclean individuals.
        He hates bad manners, non-drinkers, picky eaters,
        Volvo-owners, and opera.  He is a dromomaniac, but is
        usually in the Eastern U. S. or Western Europe.  I seek for
        him a comely lady over 33, probably fair, who derives from
        similar circumstances, and shares his opinions and his real
        passion for love, laughter, liberty, and property; she will,
        I hope, take him off someplace so I can get some work done.
        Write to Dr. Louise Henke, 103 Hampton Court, Lexington, Ky.

        vitae.  I will get back to you quickly.

Then there was the time Ohm's Law became false by act of Congress.  It seems
that there was a need for standards of measurement for electrical quantities.
Based on (unfortunate) technical advice, Congress defined the ohm in terms of
the resistance of a cubic centimeter of mercury (or some such) under specified
conditions; the volt by the output of some standard cell; and the ampere by
the amount of copper plated out in a given setup in a unit of time.  As it
turns out, there were systematic errors in the experiments used as a basis for
the standards which exceeded the error estimates given, and written into the
law.  As a result, when better experiments were done not long after, Ohm's
Law, which relates these three measurements, was suddenly false!

Every Wednesday, the New York Times runs a column called "Metropolitan Diary",
which is pretty close to being a print analogue of Desperado for New York.
Today, the following interesting item appeared:

        Breaking up is hard to do unless one lives on the West Side, where
        conversations are always on two levels and sometimes four levels.
        Consider this recent exchange between a trench-coated couple in Amy's
        Restaurant at 72d Street and Broadway after what was quite likely
        their last lunch together.

                He:  What else do you want?
                She (snappishly):  Nothing!
                He:  How do you take it?
                She:  Very light.

        With that, they walked out of the restaurant and into the rain.  She
        turned north, he south.  Neither looked back.

Over the last couple of weeks the Diary has been collecting palindromes.  This
week's gems:

In the April 14 issue of EDN Magazine, there is a NewsBreaks item that merits
a lot of attention, if it really means what it says.  I quote:

        "MODULAR LOGIC ANALYZER COMES WITN BUILT-IN MANUAL

Biomation's (Santa Clara, CA) first modular logic analyzer, the K105-D,
accepts a mix of high- and low-speed sampling boards ... The instrument also
features a complete mini manual stored in compressed ASCII in an on-board ROM.
It costs $89.95 to $18,000, depending on options."

I couldn't believe the last DESPERADO.  Egan stole my thunder exactly.
I am also leaving DEC, after some 10 years, and could have also told
stories about the old Mill and then Marlboro.  I too feel the call of
smaller is better and agree that DEC used to be that way and isn't

the way and the stimulating contact provided by the Enet.  Keep up the

two following types:

1.  An experienced CAD co-ordinator, whose responsibilies would include  co-

    efforts with those of other groups.  Some creation of CAD tools is prob-
    able, and the co-ordinator would also manage our CAD systems.

   2.7  RSX-11M COMPATIBILITY MODE - AME

   This section describes VAX/VMS Version 3.3 changes to the Applications
   Migration Executive (AME).

   2.7.1  Retraction of Version 3.2 Patch

   VAX/VMS Version 3.2 included a patch for RSXSHR.EXE which modified how
   the  AME  handled  the C-Mode PC when an exception occurred.  Although
   the modified behavior was closer  to  the  equivalent  behavior  under
   RSX-11M,  some  VAX-11  optional software products depend on the AME's
   incompatible behavior.  Therefore, a patch to retract the Version  3.2
   patch is included in Version 3.3.

DIRECTION TO SET UP 5 STORY BAMBOO BIRD CAGE

Step 1: Set up sides A.B.C.D. and floor E by connecting the 4 corners with
     sticks.  Secure the floor E by fitting the overlaping sticks on floor
     E to the holes of A and C,

Step 2: Connect sides F and G with 4 corner sticks to step 1. which is already
     set up.  Set roof H connecting by insertion of the four short 2" sticks
     through the piton screws (second story)

Step 3: Step 4 and 5 are the same set up as step 2

Step 6: Set up K are the same Set up as H.

Step 7: Set up I.J. are L.M. the same set up as F.G.

Step 8: Set up O and P they have four holes and set roof S connecting by
     insertion of the two long 10" sticks through the piton screws.

I've got a nifty-keeno-golly-gee-whiz collection of privileged tasks for
RSX11M+ V2.0/2.1 written in my more insane times (descriptions follow below).
If you would like to get a copy of them for yourself, send me mail at
TSC::MOLSON::OREILLY.

ADB -- Program to look up a selected common region, and print a dynamically-
       updated list of all tasks currently mapped to it

PWQ -- Program to print the contents of the partition wait queues for all
       system-controlled partitions, including the reason the task is in
       the queue (run request or checkpointed)

CKP -- Program to print the contents of the system checkpoint files, to include
       the task name, size (in disk blocks), and starting block number in the
       checkpoint file where the task resides

CKQ -- Program to print the entire contents of the clock queue, not just
       tasks, but also time-based requests queued by the executive

CKD -- Program to print a summary listing by file extension for all UIC's on
       a disk or a specific UIC.  This program is not privileged, but does
       direct I/O to the ACP's.

Please note the above tasks are guaranteed to run only on M+ systems (they
*SHOULD* run on M systems, but I'm too chicken to try them out).

Also, I've got a couple more privileged tasks, but they have an obscure bug
or two -- they tend to execute EOS (end-of-system) occasionally...
