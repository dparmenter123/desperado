Subject: About that VAX-11/782

 (Doing what I can to remain anonymous)

 There's a story floating around that the VAX-11/782 that was intercepted
 en route to the East did not happen quite that way.

 The story says that the machine intercepted was a CRAY, not a VAX-11/782.
 But when the Commerce Department and CIA realized what they had, they
 decided to change the name to forestall a panic in the high-tech sector.
 After all, if a CRAY had fallen into Soviet hands, what do we have left?

 The story says that Digital was approached, and allowed Commerce to give
 us some free publicity (and good publicity too) by picking an obscure VAX
 of little significance to defense. After all, it wasn't DECs fault, in any
 case, so nothing to loose and a lot to gain.

 Meanwhile, DEC is being reviewed by Commerce in terms of import/export
 regulation. If the result of this review is mild, then I think we can say
 that this story obtains some credibility. Can anyone in the DESPERADO
 readership confirm this story?

  {If the story is true, then revealing it might have nasty consequences.
   Bear that in mind if you elect to publish. Likewise, leave the means by
   which this story reached you confidential, OK? }

  Thanks and best wishes -

Okay, everybody.  Don't tell a soul.

This makes sense of the comment that the seized computer was 'of no
conceivable civilian use'.

I'm passing this along an obvious rumor.  I have no idea whether it is
true, but whoever sent it to me heard it from somebody and Desperado
is just another part of the rumor grapevine.  Besides, it's a great
story, and I wouldn't pass it up anyway.  Maybe I made it up.

Our readers in the National Security Agency already know what kind of
computer was seized, and so do the Russians.  And it *was* seized.
There are only a few dozen Crays in the world; they're much easier to
keep track of than VAXes.

And, of course, readers in the National Security Agency are too smart
to give credence to the rumor by hassling me.  Right, fellas?  Fellas?

The latest issue of Forbes has an interesting quote from Ken Olsen:

&gt; Every DEC office in the world, from Europe to Japan is connected here
&gt; [the Mill].  It's wonderful.  It used to be, if I was sore about something,
&gt; my secretary would have to type and retype the memo, get it printed up and
&gt; mail it out - the whole process would take three days.  Now, if I come in
&gt; at 8 a.m. and I'm sore, everybody in the company, worldwide, can know it
&gt; by 9 a.m.

        I guess he hasn't been sore lately...

Subject: Soviets and VAXes

About the Soviets getting VAXes...

        A  few years ago,   Military Electronics &amp; Countermeasures  had a
report on three new Soviet military aircraft designated the RAM-J, RAM-K,
and  RAM-L  under development at the  Ramenskoye  Experimentation  Center
(hence the  prefix  "RAM").    The RAM-J  was a clone of our  A-10 ground
attack aircraft,  from the above-wing pylon-mounted engines right down to
the  30mm anti-tank gatling gun in the fuselage.    The RAM-K was so much
like an F-14 that experts concluded that the Soviets are in possession of
the engineering drawings of the  F-14.    The  RAM-L was observed to be a
cross between an F-16 and an F-18.

        Even if it's possible to keep the Soviets from getting VAXes,  if
they want them badly enough,   they'll probably do what they've done many
times in the past...  reverse-engineer their own.   The rather pedestrian
technology  and  high utility of the VAX makes it a perfect candidate for
copying.

        Since they'll probably have 'em  one way or the other,  we  might
as well make a buck out of it.

BUT, I don't think they could back-engineer a Cray, and I don't think
we would want them to have one, however they got it.  And I don't know
that they could invent one.

For the "...at this point in time..." crowd, here is another bit of linguistic
overkill I saw recently.  The US Commotion (oops, read 'commission') on Human
Rights no longer uses the word "killing" - it has been supplanted with the
infinitely more explicit (?) "unlawful and arbitrary deprivation of life"...
I wonder if it's impossible to teach the KISS philosophy of design  (Keep It

My first computer was also a DIGICOMP-I... I'd read the Sept 65 Scientific
American special issue on computing and decided that I wanted to play with
one of those toys, so my dad got me one for Christmas...

Well, I don't have it anymore, but I think of it often. You see, it was a neat
little box, and even came with some programming examples. It also had a long
section in its manual on "theory" which was understandable. The problem is
that it never gave you even the vaguest hint as to how to actually program it.
All you had was three (maybe four) sample programs, without comments. (One of
them simulated an elevator system...) I must have spent months trying to
figure the beast out. Finally, we sent a very nasty letter to Edmund Scientific
and got a reply back that they were getting together a new manual that actually
said how to program the thing and they would send us a free copy... It never
arrived.  Whenever I read some of DEC's better manuals I think of my
DIGICOMP-I. Sometimes I think the DIGICOMP-I documentation is an improvement
over some of what we ship... At least it had programming examples.

        As I recall, DESPERADO has had some talk of the "personal names" from
MAIL.  The idea, I assume, is to put a line of useful information in so that
people can identify you beyond your username.  For example,

                    "Jym Dyer DTN 381-1302 ZKO1-2/F02"

is a reasonable personal name.  However, there are some who see fit to use
these names to scrawl graffiti, such as

                    "RSTS/E did it better!"
                    "This space intentionally left blank."

        I must admit that I fall into the latter group of people.  I don't hang
on to the same one, though; I change it from time to time.  Until recently, my
personal name was

                    "Official Mail of the 1984 Olympics"

which is a reasonable personal name to have these days.

In your netnews article referenced above, you refer to the 1984
Olympics.  I have not heard of any electronic mail facilities for the
1984 Olympics from DEC, but there *is* an electronic mail system being
developed by AT&amp;T for the occasion - a large one, in fact (it's being
done by the people down the hall from me).  This effort is being given a
lot of publicity by AT&amp;T.  Unless you do in fact have some official
association with the 1984 Olympics, I suspect you really don't want to
be posting public articles that imply that you are affiliated with our
work.  (At least, I suspect our lawyers wouldn't want you to...)

After experiencing a Magnitude 6.2 earthquake at 1:15 PM today, the
entire Silicon Valley disk industry has been wiped out.  Industry sources
report millions of warped disks and miswritten servo tracks. There is
some speculation that Gov. Dukemajian will be requesting federal emergency
disaster funds to compensate the estimated 10^18 bytes of storage capacity
destroyed today.  Reports of head crashes have just started filtering in
from the field, including one account of a whole population of RM05's
crashing in Sunnyvale.  The news is apparently not totally bleak as rumors
circulated later this afternoon that five startup companies are being formed
to recycle the damaged disk drives, media and heads for double density
applications. They have already hired all the employees of other disk drive
startup companies whose cash flows would not sustain them through today's
production loss.  The aftershocks of this earthquake are being felt on Wall
St., where venture capital for startups building new disk products is expected
to dry up completely.  As one industry analyst put it:  We expect to see
a resurgence of interest in bubble memories."

A G0004 is described, in which many G0003 involving strikingly
different G0005 and levels of G0006 can be made.  The question "What
differentiates the good G0003 from the bad G0003?" is discussed, and
the problem of how to G0008 a G0009 G0010 of the G0011 G0012 to come
up with such G0003 (and to have a sense for their quality) is
considered.  A key part of the proposed system, now under
development, is its dependence on G0013 G0014 G0015 of G0016
interacting "G0017" (selected at random to G0019 with G0020
proportional to G0021 assigned "G0022").  Another key G0023 is a
G0024 of linked G0005 of varying levels of "G0025", in which G0026
spreads and G0027 controls the G0028 of new G0017. The shifting of
(1) G0033 G0034 inside structures, (2) descriptive G0005 chosen to
apply to G0030, and (3) G0043 perceived as "G0031" or not, is called

(2) the permanent ("G0035") G0005 and links in the G0036 network, or
"G0037 network".  The G0038 of this system is G0039 as a general
G0038 suitable for dealing not only with fluid G0003, but also with
other types of G0039 G0040 and G0041 tasks, such as musical G0040,

As I mentioned earlier, I now have a different view on versions

                V1 is a necessity
                V2 is a sign of ingenuity or weakness
                V3 is a sign of failure

We're in the business of producing and selling products.  If we don't produce
them, we can't sell them.  Therefore V1.  Sometimes, we release V1 before its
ready in order to prepare the market.  Hence, V2.  But other times, we take
a perfectly reasonable product and one plus it because we don't have anything
better to do.

V3, and there have been many at DEC, is a real failure.  Usually we are trying
to develop some really new ideas.  But the process of starting a new product,
the reluctance to leave an old friend, the bullshit of product maintanence,
cause us to hide the new idea inside an old idea.  Bad news!

        o We don't gain the full benefit of a new product
        o We end up dealing with a lot baggage when we should just flat out
          tell the customer, if you want the stuff you've got to have the
          right hardware.  After all, we are in the business of selling stuff.
        o We end up giving the new stuff away to a large number of customers

Let's use VMS as an example.  V1 was bare bones.  V2 made it a real contender.
But V3 should have been called VMSplus V1 or something.  A new product.
V4 called VMSclusters V1.  Meanwhile MicroVMS V1 would have been created and
out by now.  Another new product.  I beleive that the directions that VMS has/is
going would have much clearer.

Much of my thinking here comes from notes from Ron Ham.  Just to show I'm not
biased, P/OS sure is stretching the point.  V1.0, V1.1, V1.5, V1.7, and V2.0.
And V3.0 is rumored to be coming in the fall.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
This is really an eye-opening idea.

Go back and read it again.  Every strength is a weakness.  Samson's
hair made him strong, but Delilah cut it and it made him weak.  One of
DEC's great strengths is compatibility, but it's a weakness as well,
when we try to preserve the purity of every command procedure and
program that anyone might have ever written.  I think the RSX-11M
customers would not have minded if we'd left it alone starting four
years ago and worked only on RSX-11M-PLUS till we got that in pretty
good shape and then switched to Micro/RSX 18 months ago.  In some
ways, that's what happened anyway, but we didn't know it.

How would this idea apply to your product?

systems; apparently they haven't survived.  One example:  OS/360 - a theocracy.
You can get anything you want, if you know the right incantation.  (I think
that one was mine, but enough of them flew around that I wouldn't swear to it.)

The SPR reproduced in #1092 is authentic.  Andy Goldstein, at the time the
erstwhile keeper of DUNGEON, wrote the SPR response.  If I recall correctly,
the bug had something to do with defining a group logical name for LOGINOUT
to point to your own trojan-horse image that then got activated with
privs when someone logged in.  As may be apparent from the "fixed in VMS V2.3",
this answer dates back about 3 years.

It was interesting to read in Lou Cohen's account that buildings in some areas
of Japan are numbered chronologically. I suspect that was how the buildings were
numbered here at the Mill.

Subj:   DEC Hardware - The coming Year

For Mike, and others, I am periodically called on to give an overview of
Digital's hardware / software strategies for the coming 2-3 years.
It's been about a year since I last updated my presentation, so sometime
in the next couple of months I'll prepare a new one.

The purpose of this mail is to point out the unique position Digital is
in.  Over the next 12 months we will replace virtually every major
hardware product offered by the company!  I don't think any other vendor
has ever had this level of product line revision in such a short time
period.  Even more amazingly, if the plans work out, we'll replace
everything again within another 18-24 months.

On May 1, 1985 Digital's hardware product line will look something like
this:

Current Product                                 Replacement Product

AND ON AND ON!!

Not to mention the VT220 for the VT100 and the VT240 for the VT125.

But we still don't have a floppy device with a switch on it that says
'IBM' on one side and 'DEC' on the other.  That, along with a Q-bus 8086
would give us easy transfer of software between them and us.  We have
'The Bridge', but it seems expensive for what you get.

Just a thought.

Don't forward this stuff outside the company.
