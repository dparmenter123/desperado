The prelude is accompanied by the plaintive yet ennobling strains of
the Prisoners' Chorus from Fidelio. I have just emerged from an intense
three weeks of performance overload, from _Carmina_Burana_, in which I took
the part of Coro II, to _Arsenic_and_Old_Lace_, in which I played Abby, the
elder and battier of the two sweet little old ladies. And may I say what
a pleasure it is to see the light of day and your smiling faces again!

And before we get down to it, let me acknowledge the half-dozen folks who
sent me a long but compelling article by James Fallows, from the Atlantic
Monthly. I didn't print it because I got it from so many sources, but
in this article, Mr. Fallows, who writes about culture shock in
Asia, describes what he has to go through to submit material to the Atlantic
via MCI Mail from Malaysia. Made me think of an interview with Wayne Shorter
that I heard on NPR's All Things Considered. Shorter described how he
assembled his new band -- he got on the net and sent electronic mail to his
buddies in Europe. This is a long way from going down to the ballerinas'
union hall and seeing if you can pick up a gig...

Anyone who didn't see the Fallows article can send me a request and I'll
send it along. And while we're on the subject of modern times...

Subj:   This is what happens when you send a 5 line letter to Vogon News Service

From:   THUNDR::ADVAX::CASEE::VNS "The VOGON News Service"
To:     ADVAX::THUNDR::MINOW
Subj:   Your Letter to the VNS

    Dear Reader,

        Your letter to the VNS has been accepted by the publisher, however,
    there is not enough space to publish it in the current issue.  The VNS
    will attempt to find space for your letter in the next few days'
    issues.  If space in the letters page is not available within a few
    days your letter will be returned to you and will not be published.

        Due to the need to respect the network and resources that support
    us, the VNS allocates a limited amount of space for letters in each
    issue.  Incoming letters, if they are not too big or rejected by the
    publisher for other reasons, are held in a "pile" pending available
    space.  When each issue is compiled the letters to be published in it
    are chosen from the pile according to a set of factors that include:

        o       brevity, although, to avoid the letters page becoming a
                sequence of one-liners, letters shorter than 750 characters
                (9-10 full lines) are counted as being that long,
        o       "newness" of topic, *Note* only one topic per letter please,
        o       how recently the author has had a letter published,
        o       how long the letter has been waiting on the pile,

        In other words, you have the best chance of your letter being
    published if it is short, on a new topic, and if you haven't had a
    letter published recently.  If space in the letters page is not
    available within a few days your letter will be returned to you and
    will not be published.

        Also, the VNS sets a limit of 3000 characters per letter -- about
    40 lines.  Note that leading spaces and tabs are not counted and blank
    lines are only counted as one character.  Your name and location are
    added automatically by the VNS and are not included in the calculation
    of the size of your letter.

        Please note the publisher will reject letters that contain
    obscenities, DIGITAL proprietary information, non-textual characters
    (graphics), offensive statements, personal attacks or statements of
    dubious legality.

        While we welcome intelligent correspondence on a wide range of
    topics it should be understood that we consider our primary purpose to
    be the provision of news and information to the network community.

    Regards,

Subj:   sexism in Desparado #1145

I've just finished reading the latest issue, and noticed something that
may conflict with the Corporate guidelines regarding sexism.  I have "sought
and found" contributions that denigrated

    1)  the National Security Council (all male);
    2)  the last 5 US presidents (all male);
    3)  male gay vampires;
    4)  Sid Vicious (ex-male);
    5)  the (female) editor of Desperado.

Although the last example shows that at least a token effort is being made,
you've still a ways to go to achieve a truly non-sexist publication.

Somewhere over the network
There waits news.

I sit waiting for digests
Can't you see?
Some small part of my heart leaps
When I see UUCP.

Somewhere across the telephone lines,
   Where Lauren plays and Upstill pines,
   They're waiting;
The crazies who will flame at me
   on poli-sci and arms-dash-d and ARPA-gating.

Somewhere over the network
News flies free,
News flies over the network,
Why not, why not to me?

Subj:   Is this perverted enough for DESPERADO?

     This is the  LAT.   There's  ten  million  bits  out  there,  all
churning  around  as  though they're important.  Yeah.  I should know.
Every microsecond I have to trace down some poor header for  an  irate
user  who  can't  tell  a  distributed  queue  from  a terminal-slaved
printer.

     I was sitting there  thinking  these  morbid  thoughts  when  she
logged  in.   I  tell  ya, I've seen some users in my day, but she was
somethin' else.  She had
                                 NOTE

             Due to new net  regulations,  several  paragraphs
        are intentionally left blank.  If you really MUST have
        a description, insert  any  two  paragraphs  from  the
        latest edition of "Hustler" or "Screw".

     "Where's my file?", she typed.

     "$ What?" I replied.  I was still scanning.

     "My flie!" she mistyped.  Real nervous.  I wondered what she  had
to  be  nervous  about.  "I PRINTed it ten minutes ago and now I can't
find it."

     "Which queue did you use?" I asked casually, while trying to flip
through  ELF  to  find out more about this broad.  There was somethin'
real funny about her--I mean, normally you  don't  find  these  upper-
management types rummaging around without ALL-IN-1 or DECmail support.
What was she doin' at the DCL level anyway?

     "I just said 'PRINT', and it was SUBMITted to CLUSTER_PRINT.  But
it didn't show up at the printer, and now it's not in que."

     "You mean 'queue'", I corrected, just to show her who was boss in
this  territory.  So my disk quota's only 1,000 blocks--but it's mine.
"You sure someone else didn't walk by and pick it up?"

     "Do a $SHOW  TIME,  Jocko!"  she  snapped.   "It's  1:00  in  the
morning.   The only people in the building are hackers, and they don't
work from hardcopy."

     "Okay!  Clam down." Damn!  Now she had ME making typos!  I buried
myself  in work to take my thoughts away from her looks.  A quick scan
of the distributed queues showed that they were empty.  Really  empty.
It gets lonely here at night, you know what I mean?  Those queues just
sit there silently, with empty lists so vast that you can hear marbles
roll down them like rocks in an alley.

     "There's nothing waiting to print", I said.  I  didn't  share  my
poetic  thoughts  about  queue  space  because  I  didn't  think she'd
understand.  I had a slight glimmer of an idea...  "What kind of  file
was it?" I asked.

     She hesitated.  "Graphics."

     "I need more information than that.   What  kind?   ReGIS?   GKM?
Digitized?"

     "Digitized.  I thin.  I dont no." Her typing was really  breaking
down under pressure.  I ignored it.

     "Then the only printer we've got around  here  that  will  handle
something  like  that  is the PrintServer.  How long ago did you check
it?"

     "Five minutes."

     "Long enough.  Digitized files aren't like  ASCII,  honey.   They
take  up  a lot of space and take a long time to transmit.  Also, they
were probably shuffled off to the PrintServer queue, and then  to  the
PrintServer memory, while you were lookin' around in the wrong place."
I was heading down the hall while I talked.  By the time she  realized
what I was going to do, it would be too late.

     "Wait!" she finally said, scrambling after me.  I was already  at
the  printer,  but  she  dodged  past me and pulled the sheet from the
tray.  I got a glimpse, but a glimpse was enough.

     "Tom Seleck," I breathed.  "Nude.  Where'd you get that?"

     She held it blank  side  out,  defensively.   "Some  experimental
software.  It can alter images."

     "And take clothes off pictures," I sneered.  "You got your print.
Also,  you learned that stuff takes a while to get through the queues,
especially when they're distributed."

     "I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't say  anything  about  this..."
she began.  She was talking to my back.  I was already walking away to
my cubicle.

     Once there, I had a good stiff pull on the vending  machine  Coke
to  get  myself  together.   There's  lots of slime out there; lots of
people ready to turn a fast disk or juggle  some  software.   However,
there's this picture of Samantha Fox I've got...

     This is the LAT.  It's a jungle at  times:   things  with  teeth,
ready to byte...

Subj:   The Other Shoe

A guy is always in bed at 10 prompt. A new neighbor moves into the
apartment above who doesn't go to bed until 12. The first night our
guy is sound asleep when the neighbor sits on his bed and starts to
take off his shoes.

Boom! He drops the first shoe on the floor. Our sleeper bolts upright
in his bed. Boom!, goes the second shoe. Then all is quiet; the guy
lays back and falls asleep.

Next night, same thing. Boom! goes the first shoe. Guy wakes up, puts
his feet on the floor. Boom! goes the second shoe. Guy runs upstairs
and pounds on the door. Neighbor opens the door, standing in his
socks.

"What's that bloody noise you just made?!?!" our guy yells.

"Sorry, friend, I just took off my shoes. Didn't know it'd bother
anyone. I'll be careful next time," says the repentant neighbor.

Next night, our guy's asleep when the neighbor sits on his bed.
Boom! goes the first shoe. Oops! He forgot. He takes off the second
shoe and puts it quietly on the floor.

Meanwhile, the guy downstairs is sitting up in bed, waiting for the
other shoe to drop.

Subj:   dropping the other shoe

See, you're in this cheap two-story motel by the side of the road
somewhere in the rural US. You've been driving all day and you're
going to be driving all day tomorrow. The walls are so thin you
can hear the couple at the end of the hall having a fight about
his mother and the truck driver next door is a sports fan, so you've
been listening to wrestling and roller derby broadcasts all evening.
You went to bed early so you could be fresh for the long drive tomorrow,
but the roller derby didn't end till twelve, then the couple
having the fight made up and kept everybody awake for another
hour or so, and then somebody upstairs insisted on singing in the
shower to the accompaniment of banging pipes.

But finally it's two a.m., everyone is quiet, and you're just drifting
off to sleep, when . . .

BANG!

You are jarred out of your wonderful semi-drowsing state by a shoe
falling on the floor. You hear the creaking of the bedsprings as the
person upstairs lifts the other foot to untie the other shoe --

and you just try going to sleep before that one falls, too!

     I was intrigued by the lament a couple issues back about the fear
     that  some  idyllic  island  in the Caribbean would be overrun by
     "ugly Americans."

     Having done a fair amount of traveling  in  the  last  couple  of
     years,  I  am  not  convinced  we  are  any uglier than any other
     nationality.   I   have   observed   French,   German,   British,
     Australian,  and  Japanese travelers being peevish, stubborn, and
     demanding in England, Italy, Hong Kong, and China.  In these same
     locales,  I  have  seen  Americans  be  sensitive,  generous, and
     without complaints.

     However, there are not as many of them as there are  of  us,  and
     more  of  us  have  more money than most of them.  Thus we travel
     more and have far more opportunities to be observed doing  coarse
     and  insensitive  things in other countries.  When the Brits were
     making the rounds of the globe in the last century, they were not
     terribly popular either.

     It is indeed crushing to return to that the special island in the
     Caribbean  or charming town on the Amalfi coast and find it awash
     with excess  humanity.   Most  of  that  excess  speaks  American
     English,  and it's most unpleasant to find yourself in the thick of
     what were trying to get away from.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The saddest thing is when you are abroad and behaving the way you do at
home, which is to say quietly, politely, and charmingly, and somebody
mistakes you for some other English-speaking national. In England, it
always used to be Canadians we were taken for, and a delightful lady in a
mouth-watering shop in Strasbourg took me for English. My husband tried to
winkle me out of this shop, and I explained in my halting French that
he was my husband, who had no patience. And the lady laughed and said,
"Tous les hommes sont les memes! Les Francais, les Anglais..."

And I keep thinking I should stand up and proudly claim to be an American,
to try and counteract our awful reputation, but somehow...

Subj:   Medical Ethics in the time of Chaucer

From Usenet net.med:

        The Bergen County (NJ) Medical Society Bulletin recently reprinted
a list of rules of conduct supposedly given to medical students in the
time of Chaucer.  These rules, taken from a book titled
_The_Astonishing_History_of_the_Medical_Profession_, by E.S. Turner,
indicate that physicians of the period were extremely canny in warding
off problems of patient satisfaction.  Here are some samples:

 o Tell the patient that, with God's help, you hope to cure him, but
inform the family that the case is grave.  Then, if he dies, you will
have safeguarded yourself.  If he recovers, it will be a testimony to
your skill and wisdom.

 o When called to a patient, find out from his messenger as much about
him as you can before you arrive.  Then, if his pulse and urine, tell you
nothing, you can still suprise the patient with your knowledge of his
condition.

 o When feeling a patient's pulse, allow for the fact that he may be
disturbed by your arrival and by the thought of the fee you are going to
charge him.

 o If you are asked to dinner, stay sober.  During the meal, inquire
frequently after the patient, lest he suspect that you have forgotten him
in your enjoyment of his viands.

 o Do not look lecherously on the patient's wife, daughters, or
maidservants, or kiss them, or fondle their breasts.

 o Do not disparage your fellow physicians.  If you do not know them
personally, say you have heard nothing byt good of them.

 o If you find the patient dead on your arrival, show no suprise.  Say
you knew from the account of his symptoms he would not recover and
inquire the hour at which he died.  This will enhance your professional
reputation.

        Following these rules feudal physicians did not experience a
single multi-million-dollar-plus judgement.

    and James Trefil, a scientist -- have identified nearly 5,000
    names, concepts, proverbs (from "Absence makes the heart grow
    fonder" to "Youth will have its fling"), idioms, historical
    characters and events, technical terms, places and other entities
    most of which tend to appear regularly in serious newspapers,
    grown-up magazines and popular books of a thoughtful kind.
    These expressions are the tokens of communication between writers
    and readers in our society, Mr. Hirsch believes, the tools
    of the culturally literate, and people who can't use these
    tools are laboring under a handicap.  He thinks a high school
    graduate ought to command them.

    Mr. Hirsch's findings, and his supporting arguments, will appear
    next month in a book called "Cultural Literacy," published
    by Basic Books.  For now, however, here is a quiz consisting
    of just 100 items -- and not the hardest 100 -- selected from
    Mr. Hirsch's list by the editors of The Book Review.  The answers
    do NOT appear elsewhere in this issue, so readers will have
    to score themselves.  You know what these things signify or
    you don't.  Be honest.

    A score of 100 is passing, Mr. Hirsch believes, and 95 could
    just be bad luck;  85 to 95 suggests you may be missing out
    on something; below 85, there is cause for concern.  Below
    75, either this quiz is a "Procrustean bed" or else "Ignorance
    is bliss."

UHCLEM::CROLL is now one of my favorite people. That issue of the NY Times
Review of Books has been mouldering in my cube for weeks waiting for me
laboriously to type it in, and then this appeared on the doorstep. My husband
and I hit all 100, but I am disgusted that it rates us only as "passing".

A pre-season trivia question:

Name the pitcher who three times won 25 games and did NOT win the
Cy Young award (ever, I believe).

Hints:  He pitched in both major leagues.  His three 25-win seasons
        were all with one team.  He was right-handed.  His career
        was post-WW2.

Other hints:  His 25-win seasons were in the National League.
He had a distinctive, high leg-kick.
He once bashed John Roseboro of the Dodgers in the head with a baseball
bat.

Yep.  Juan Marichal.  He was 25-7 in 1963 when Koufax was 25-5.  He
won 25 agin in 1965 or 1966 when Koufax was 27-9.  And he won 25
in the pitcher's year (1968) when Bob Gibson was virtually unhittable.

    According to the NY Times, seen in a car window in New York City:

        I'm not going to lie to you.  I do have a radio, but it's
        broken.  Actually, it's stuck on one station -- WQXR.  So
        unless you like classical music, it doesn't make any sense
        for you to break into my car.  I am planning to get the
        radio fixed, maybe even add a tape player.  I'll keep you
        posted.
