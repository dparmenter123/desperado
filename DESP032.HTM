            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEW FROM DIGITAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        In keeping with Digital's striving to provide the best in
remote diagnostic support for its customers, we are pleased to
announce TELE-PATH (tm). Using the recently developed Hewlett-Packard
SOS (seance-on-silicon) chip technology, we have finally developed
the last word in remote trouble shooting.

        By allowing one of our diagnostic computers to dial in to your
system we can start a TELE-PATH sesion to track down problems past,
present and future. Won't you be the envy of every system manager on
your block, when you are able to predict down to the second your next
system crash and even be able to pre-notify field service of impending
problems? Think of the savings to both time and money.

        It all starts out like this. Your OUIJA (tm) front panel will
inform you of the need to contact the diagnostic center. Because our
SOS system will be expecting your call you won't have the usual
contract verification delays. Don't worry if you've deleted the dump
from the crash, SOS technology will bring back the spirit of the crash
for analysis. Running the system tester, EXORCISER (tm) we will be
able to remove demons from your disks, poltergeists from your
peripherals and fix posessed processors. All of this will be
classified under the revolutionary new system known as TWIRPS (tm)
(Telepathic Worldwide Identify &amp; Resolve Problem System)

        No need to contact the Digital local office for this service.
                                We'll know when you need it..........

Here are some more chocolate recipes.  These are from my wife's
dessert cookbook, titled EATME.  We published the book with some
friends about ten years ago.  She got a 10-pound bar of Yucatan dark
coating chocolate for Christmas.

1.                      TRIPLE CHOCOLATE WOW

A substantial, silky sweet--more solid than frosting, lighter than
fudge.  A perfect medium-easy treat for a winter night.

1 C. crushed vanilla wafers
2/3 C. soft butter
1 1/3 C. sifted confectioner's sugar (*must* be sifted first)
2 egg yolks
2 bars, 4 oz. each, German sweet chocolate, melted
2/3 C. chopped walnuts
1 t. vanilla
2 egg whites, stiffly beaten

Melt chocolate slowly over hot water, crush vanilla wafers (paper bag
and rolling pin, or blender--crumbs should be very fine), chop nuts
(which really should be *walnuts*; much drier and crunchier than
pecans) coarsely, sift and measure sugar.  Let egg whites wait to be
beaten until you need them.

Sprinkle half the crumbs on the bottom of 9" square cake pan.  Cream
butter and sugar, stir in the egg yolks, chocolate (cooled a bit),
nuts, and vanilla.  Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry, fold them
into the chocolate gently.  Spread over crumbs in pan, sprinkle
remaining crumbs over top.  Chill at least 1 1/2 hours, cut in 9
servings.  Try to save a morsel out so you can see how good it is at
room temperature.  A different sensual experience entirely.

2.                    COLD HOT FUDGE SAUCE

In an occasional ice cream parlor you can find hot fudge sauce that
solidifies on the ice cream instead of staying gloppy.  If you're that
kind of goose, this is your sauce.

2 oz. unsweetened chocolate
1 T. butter
1/3 C. boiling water
1 C. sugar
2 T. white corn syrup
1 t. vanilla

Using a double boiler, melt chocolate over hot water.  Add butter and
stir until melted.  Add boiling water and blend.  Add sugar and corn
syrup.  Over direct heat, permit sauce to boil gently, without
stirring, for 8 minutes.  Cool somewhat, then add 1 t. vanilla and
serve over ice cream.  Wowie zowie.

3.                         WARM FUDGE

Warm because it rarely has a chance to cool before it's eaten.
Everyone cuts and ruins their teeth on fudge.  Don't bother with those
debased marsmallow/chocolate chip travesties.  *Real* fudge, creamy
and nutty and chocolate, is worth the trouble.

1 C. milk
2 C. sugar
1/8 t. salt
2 oz. Nestle's Choco-Bake (liquid unsweetened chocolate)
2 T. butter
1/2 C. chopped pecans
1 t. vanilla

In a heavy saucepan, bring milk to a boil.  Remove from heat, add
sugar, salt, and chocolate, and stir until all is dissolved.  On
medium heat, boil without stirring to 238 degrees.  Remove from heat,
add butter, and cool without stirring or justling in any way to 110
degrees, or until bottom of pan feels only warm.  Add nuts and vanilla
and beat until fudge is stiff and has lost its sheen.  "Lost sheen" is
a very real stage--when it happens you'll recognize it.  Get it out of
the pan ond onto waxed paper by whatever means you can devise; press
it into shape, and cut into squares.

As usual, if the fudge won't turn, persevere.  If perseverance gets
boring, pour it out and check later.  Sometimes it turns, sometimes it
doesn't.  If not, get out the spoons and try again another day.

Subject: Here is a truffle recipe, makes about 10 dozen:

2 lbs   Dark coating chocolate
6 oz    Unsweetened baking chocolate
3 oz    Unsalted butter
3 dl    (1 1/4 cup) Cointreau

Chop the chocolate.  Melt together with the butter over simmering
water.  Stir continuously with a rubber spatula.  Don't let water get
into the chocolate.  Warm the Cointreau to the same temperature as the
chocolate.  Slowly blend the Cointreau into the chocolate (still over
the water).  Stir continuously.  Do this slowly (as if you were making
Hollandaise).  Using an electric mixer, beat the mixture until cool and
somewhat thickened.  (Takes about 5 minutes; you'll need a good mixer.)

Line a large baking sheet (11 x 17) with wax paper.  Pour in the truffle
mix.  (This will fill the pan.)  Chill in the refrigerator until solid.

Use a pizza cutter to cut the stuff into strips (peel off the wax paper),
then into squares.  Take each one, mash it in your palm, and roll in
cocoa.  Chill some more.

Substitute other liqueurs (Chambord, Amaretto, Kahlua) and coatings
(chopped roasted almonds, finely chopped candied orange peel, coffee
beans run through a nutmeg grinder, etc.)

One of the disadvantages of the net is that you can't just wander past
my office and try one.

Subject: More about the formula of speech...

I'm no tough legislation nut when it comes to the spoken word.  And poetic
license opens up a galaxy of creative expression for literary pyromaniacs
who don't burn themselves up in the attempt.  (Nice.  I like that.)

But let us not dismiss order for the sake of creative freedom.  The
spoken word has very few restrictions, which is why dialects can be so
entertaining.

But formal rules of writing have their place as well.  And to discard
them as a nuisance seems dangerous as well as blase.

The national reading level is a perfect example of the problem.  Not
only are students generally becoming less literate, but those
providing the instruction seem to suffer the same malady.   Spend an
afternoon listening to conversations in any K-Mart and you should come
away from it wondering if Devo hasn't really got something.

Language always changes and grows:  it's alive.  But civilization has
the collective ability to maintain order at the same time.  Today's
world seems to have less and less responsibility to posterity (we
sweep nuclear waste under the carpet).  We should at least maintain
the ability to communicate to posterity that there may be ghosts in
the closet (or under the rug).

12:01 A.M. indeed!  Does this mean that 12:00:59 A.M. is still part of the
previous century?  It is bad enough to be bound by the limits of our
chosen symbols, let alone by the choice of one possible symbol from the
many which exist.

There are perfectly acceptable classical means of describing the EXACT
moment at which a century turns over - if such a moment exists.  Should
time turn out to be quantized (or worse), either the question or our
understanding of its terms will need redefinition.  Given the frequent
use of centuries as an inexact implied measure of the degree to which some
previous (or subseqent) state of civilization differs from the present one,
perhaps it would be more useful to unbind the definition of 'century' from
its linear relationship to measurable time (which may itself be elastic)
in order to obtain a formal unit of measure for this difference:  thus
could comfortably large numbers of centuries cluster about the present
where we need them most, with the concentration trailing off as the
separation by time (or culture) dulls our appreciation.

The screenplay for Henson's "Dark Crystal" was authored by David Odell (no
apostrophe), an erstwhile software technical writer and colleague of mine
while we both worked at Honeywell. David spent most of his time studying
Russian, and talking about scripts he intended to write: he claimed to have
gotten seed money from United (or Allied, I forget) Artists for an option on
Burgess's novel "A Clockwork Orange," but nothing came of that (for him, any-
way). After dithering about for a year or so, he quit, telling his boss he
was off to write screenplays. You can imagine the boss's response. David's
first cinematic effort to make it to the silver screen was the immortal
"Cry Uncle," a true cultist's delight; this one is so obscure, most cultists
don't know about it. I saw it during its brief (one day, I think) run at the
Embassy in Waltham. It starred Allen Garfield (or Goorwitz, as he is now
billed), and had Barnard Hughes in a short, but pungent, supporting role.

Subsequently, David moved to England and joined the Henson staff; you see
his name on the Muppets show reruns. He also worked on the first Muppet movie;
in fact, his name is the last thing you see ("With special thanks to David
Odell").

Every time I see our ex-boss, he asks what Odell's doing, and I always make it
a point to tell him, in the most glowing terms possible.

Other things of equally little moment: a friend received an Atari for Xmas,
with Space Invaders and BASIC. Tiring of Invaders, I turned for surcease to
the BASIC manual that came with it. Immediately my eye was captured by a most
deft nonsequitur, which appears in the Preface (which NO one ever reads), para-
phrased as follows:

"When it first came out, BASIC could be learned in just a few hours. After
improvements, it now takes two or three weeks to learn."

Hmm... the other items were of such little moment I've forgotten what they
were. No matter.

Subject: More favorite country-western song titles (#1012)

Dennis Elfstrom's comment reminded me of two of my own favorites. "Drop
Kick Me Jesus Through the Goal-Posts of Life" was a real song; that is,
someone recorded it for serious and it got air-play. "I Got Radiation
Sickness Since My Fallout With You" was, I believe, a novelty song -- used
perhaps in someone's comedy routine? (I'm sure any number of Desperados can
fill us in on artists, dates, and discographies.)

Calvin Trillin, a very funny man, wrote a novel called "Runestruck"
apparently to exorcise a fit of awful-awful country-western tunes titles
that kept coming to him at embarassing moments (like at the supermarket:
"It's No Wonder Your Hair's Always in Curlers 'Cause You've Never Been
Straight with Me"). The character Duane Minnick was a gas-station attendant
who penned and sang such treasures as "I'm Just a Loaner While You Wait for
the Two-Door Hardtop of Your Dreams." (You used to be here, but right now
you're there./ You done left me for chrome and factory air.")

"Runestruck" is hard to find -- out of print; your local library might have
a copy. But "Uncivil Liberties," a more recent book of Trillin essays, is
still available. Some of these examples come from the essay "Country Sounds"
in that collection.

My favorite C&amp;W song title is "Separate Barstools".  Currently on the
C&amp;W hit parade is "She Got the Gold Mine (I Got the Shaft)".  Johnny
Cash sings, as a joke, "Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart",
which reminds me of that old (non-country) Blues Magoos favorite, "You
Can Take My Love and Shove It Right Up Your Heart", which reminds me,
in turn, of the Bobby Bare (country) song titled "Bathroom Tissue
Paper Letter" with the chorus:

        There was a bathroom-tissue-paper letter hangin' on the wall,
        It said "I just can't take no more and you can have it all,
       "I'm takin' what good sense I've got and leavin' you behind,
       "And you can take this letter, and wipe me from your mind."

who was a large gorilla always looking for "'nanas."   Most mornings
Bradley would have the Emperor Fenway featured in some radio skit where
he would mistake some unlikely object (e.g. a canary) for a 'nana and
eat it.  Years later, I ran into the voice and the fixation again in
