        Perot = Even George Romney was more impressive.

        One Perot supporter:  "He said he quit because he didn't want to
        disrupt the system.  I thought that was why we started this
        thing."

        Somebody around here was using "Perot's the dude" as his p-name.
        He was called on it the morning of Perot's flit and changed it to
        "Perot's the dud".

        How about that prediction in #3066 though?

        Newton, which gives a much nicer acronym.

        Today is approximately the twelfth anniversary of the Desperado
        mailings.  I received  my first piece of mail from a distribution
        list on July 28, 1980 -  something about a meeting, probably - and
        sent out my first mailing, to all the RSX writers, the next day.
        I won't say it came to  me in a flash and I saw all Desperado
        would become in an instant, but I had a pretty good idea I could
        have some fun with it.

        The first two mailings went to WRITERS.DAT.  Then, Jonathan
        Ostrowsky (jo@odi.com, as he is now) asked if he could be on the
        list, the first to ask.  I said yes, but since he was obviously no
        writer, I asked him what he was.  "Me?  A desperado, I guess."  I
        put him on the list and renamed it  DESPERADO.DAT.  He also
        established the principle that no one gets D'o without asking, or,
        at any rate, without having bumped into to somebody somewhere who
        thought they ought to see it.

        I found out the default file type the next week, and thus went
        from DAT to DIS.

        At any rate, as they form a set, here are the first three
        mailings.

My macrobiotic neighbors, as it turns out, bought some of the vegetarian dog

some meat in it.

They didn't buy any more.  Oscar is as healthy as any of them.

        also  the first forwarded response to a previous mailing.

        downhill elements, turned himself into a writer despite the

Subj:   Henry Adams on the 1884 elections

    "I know no more than Robinson Crusoe what is doing in the world, and
    care but little. Politics at this stage of an election are duller to me
    than at any other time. The mid-summer waiting for the average idiot to
    make up his mind is like the stopping in mid-ocean to repack the
    steam-chest; it makes me sick."

    "The public is angry and abusive. Every one takes part. We are all
    doing our best, and swearing at each other like demons. But the amusing
    thing is that no one talks about real interests. By common consent they
    agree to let these alone. We are afraid to discuss them. Instead of
    this, the press is engaged in a most amusing dispute whether Mr.
    Cleaveland had an illegitimate child, and did or did not live with more
    than one mistress; whether Mr. Blaine got paid in railway bonds for
    services as Speaker; and whether Mrs. Blaine had a baby three months
    after her marriage. Nothing is funnier than the letters, affidavits,
    leading articles and speeches which are flying through the air. Society
    is torn to pieces. Parties are wrecked from top to bottom. A great
    political revolution seems impending. Yet, when I am not angry, I can
    do nothing but laugh."

    "The amount I hear of this tom-foolery is calculated to make a
    tortoise-shell cat turn green. One would suppose that this country had
    never till now elected any president except G. Washington. Dear, dear,
    dear! How their grandfathers did squeal about T. Jefferson!"

    "Financially we grub along and talk poor, but the loss of thousands of
    millions has little outward effect. No improvement need be expected
    until things have got settled to a new economic bottom. Most of us are
    really better off when the great properties shrink."

Subj:   Fits to a T

Tom,

    My full name on my birth certificate is "Thomas Gregory Ames III".
Like you, I go by my middle name.  Have you ever noticed what a pain in
the neck it is to fill out the standard computer data entry form?!?
"First Name, MI, Last Name" - I swear, some companies' computers know
me as "T. G. Ames", "Thomas G.  Ames" "Gregory T. Ames" (I love that
one - "let's just reverse it and give him a mandatory first name, MI" -
usually a result of giving my full name over the phone), "T. Ames",
"G.  Ames", and all of the above with "III" on the end, beginning, or
somewhere in between.  When I first registered with the Network
Information Center (the Internet administrators) to be added to their
"whois" database, they stuck me in as "Thomas Ames III Gregory," or
something like that...

Even better is when the form wants "Last, First, MI".  Am I then "Ames,
III, T. Gregory", or "Ames, T. Gregory, III"?

When I went to the Connecticut DMV (better known as "Land of Form
Hell") at age 16 to get my driver's license and tried to explain that I
went by "T. Gregory Ames, III", I got a funny look and was told in a
droning monotone: "First Name, MI, Last Name".  After trying to explain
this a few times, I must have uttered the right sequence of tones to
trigger the "semi-independent thought" reflex, and I was told, "Oh,
well, I have to put First Name, MI, Last Name on your new license, but
you can come in any time (even tomorrow) and have us change it to FI,
Middle Name, Last Name if you want".  Now there's government
bureaucracy for you!  I won't even describe how much fun it was when I
came in and tried to do the "Thomas G." to "T. Gregory" switch.  :-)

I think we should form the "Down with First Name, MI Forms Foundation"

T. Gregory "Just Greg" Ames, III

        III, eh?  My college roomate was named Thaddeus Adamaczek XIII and
        he claimed he came by it honestly.  Let's see, that's at least 350
        years of Thaddeus Adamaczek compared to maybe 50 worth of T.
        Gregory Ames.

        By the way, I refuse to read any books by the so-called "T.
        Corrughattan Boyle" or whatever his byline is because I know he
        made the name up and it's a stupid name.  This is an application
        of my long-held belief/fave proverb:

                One speck of shit spoils the whole salad.

Subj:   D'o 3066 -  you think NMI is bad?

    In a somewhat former life, I heard of the following from my friend Zeph
 Stewart, younger brouther of Supreme Court whiz Potter Stewart, and a
 gentleman of unimpeachable veracity.

    When Zeph was being inducted into the Army early in WWII, he was preceeded
 in the processing queue by a fellow whose name was exactly "R B Jones", no
 more letters, no periods.  Needless to say, this posed a major problem, and
 impeeded the induction process by several hours.

    After receiving conflicting advise from numerous levels of superiors, and
 unsolicited, even more conflicting, and generally abusive advice from those
 waiting to be processed, the induction clerk finally decided to enter the
 name as "R(only) B(only) Jones".  At the moment, this struck all parties as
 satisfactory and unambigous.  However, when this initial paperwork reached
 its subsequent stage for an even more official level of processing, it was
 obvious to the responsible clerk that no red blooded American could have
 parentheses embedded in his name, even if nicely balanced.  So, naturally, he
 chose not to transcribe them.  This had the effect of condemning the young
 man in question to spending the next several years known to one and all as
 Ronly Bonly Jones.

"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the

it up on the shore.  Then they sat down and collected the good fish in
baskets, but threw the bad away."

Subject: Kids and misconstrued phrases

The net has gotten to be very important in my life.  I have access
at work and spend my lunch hour reading news.  I've made friends,
acquired recipes, gotten advice, received consumer information and
learned an amazing amount of trivia.  I often talk about the net at
home and repeat things I found interesting.  Even my friends have
learned to say "what does the net have to say about such and such."

Recently, I posted in another group and a reader telephoned (!) while
I was away from the house.  When I got home my husband said something
to the effect of "you'll never guess who called" and Jeremy said "yeah,
you'll never guess....it was that woman you talk about all the time."

Well, my husband looked a little baffled and explained that so-and-
so called.  As I was picking up the phone to return the call, I explained
to Jeremy that this person (with a very traditional male name) was a man
and not a woman.

Jeremy said, "Oh, I thought Daddy said Thenette called."

suppose I should just ask Jeremy to draw me a picture of what he thinks
Thenette looks like.)

Why You Should Participate:

Motif and X Window programmers continue to be among the highest paid
professionals in the UNIX arena.  The challenge we face is maintaining the edge
that makes us worth those elevated salaries.  Magazines and Internet are
irreplaceable resources, but they cannot provide the same level of help that
can be gained from direct, one-on-one contact with experts and peers who have
lived through the problems you face and have found solutions.   That's what
Motif'92 is for: the most respected experts in the field helping each other and
all the other developers and users to get more value from their investment in
Motif.

what I have found out.  I am espcially grateful to Bill Innanen and
Thomas Greene for telling me (us) how to access the LC info.  What
follows is from a posting to the RUSSIA listserver and internet.history.

      The exhibit "Revelations from the Russian Archives", opened today,
June 17, 1992, at the Library of Congress.  Those who wish to retrieve
selected portions of the documents contained in the exhibit may follow
the following instructions.
        FTP to seq1.loc.gov
        USERID: anonymous
        PASSWORD: anything or your address
        CD pub
        CD soviet.archive
        get README

The README file gives information about the documents available.
Continue to transfer files of interest using "get [filename]." Files are
in ASCII format and are not very long (no need for compressed files).
For those files with the extension .GIF (images of original Russian
text) you need some type of GIF viewer. This software is available on
bulletin boards.

More on the Top Secret Russian documents

Yesterday Linda F. sent around mail that I received regarding some
top secret Russian documents made public by the National Archives and Library
of Congress and the Russian Government.

It is not a hoax.  It is real.

While testing my chapter on Macintosh FTP software today, I logged on
to PATHWK and FTP'd three GIF images of three secret documents.

They are running on my Macintosh --whenever I am away from my desk.
This little slide show takes about one minute, so if you are passing
by please feel free to take a look.

I agree with the author of the original internet mail who says

   the fed. government is really using the internet to
   provide a service that we can really use.  (This isn't the first,
   but one of very few)

It is ironic that the ARPANET, a Cold War byproduct,
has given us yet another new way of promoting freedom of information.

Though this isn't as dramatic as the fall of the Berlin Wall, or demonstrators
challenging Soviet tanks in the heart of Moscow, it is another small sign of
the times.

The Red Army Choir recently performed in concert here in Israel.  That alone
would have been hard to imagine a few years ago.  But what really shows how far
things have come is that while here, they also appeared in a television
commercial for one of the national lotteries.  According to the local press,
each singer-soldier received $79 (the equivalent of 3 months salary) for this
appearance.

I wonder how Lenin would have reacted to the idea of the Red Army Choir being
paid to appear, in full dress uniform, in an advertisement, singing and waving
lottery tickets.

IMPACT OF LIBYA SANCTIONS ON US FIRMS/PERSONS IN SWITZERLAND

As a service to US firms and individuals, we would like to bring the following
to your attention:

The current U.S. trade embargo on Libya includes a general prohibition against
any transaction anywhere in the world by "U.S. persons" with the government of
Libya or with entities controlled by the Libyan government (specially
designated nation SDN). The U.S. government has identified TAMOIL SUISSE SA,
with over 300 gasoline retail outlets, as such an SDN. The rules would e.g.
prohibit an individual U.S. citizen from purchasing gasoline at a Tamoil gas
station, as well as purchasing shares in TAMOIL or providing services or sales
of equipment to such an enterprise.

A "US person" is defined to include individual U.S. citizens and permanent
residents and U.S. companies, but not separately incorporated foreign
subsidiaries of U.S. companies. According to a U.S. Treasury Department press

Subj:   How to get a free copy of your TRW credit report

&gt;From the RISKS Digest:

From: MCULNAN@guvax.georgetown.edu
Subject: Free TRW Credit Report

The RISKS of not checking one's credit report periodically, and especially
before applying for a mortgage or other loan or a job have been well documented
here and elsewhere.

According to USA Today, beginning April 30, you can get a free copy of your TRW
credit report once a year by writing to:

  TRW Consumer Assistance, P.O. Box 2350, Chatsworth, CA  91313-2350

Include all of the following in your letter: full name including middle initial
and generation such as Jr, Sr, III etc., current address and ZIP code, all
previous addresses and ZIPs for past five years, Social Security number, year
of birth, spouse's first name.  Also include a photocopy of a billing
statement, utility bill, driver's license or other document that links your
name with the address where the report should be mailed.

Subj:   "Why people are disinclined to pay attention to environmentalists."

&gt; There was a photo in the Boston Globe of a house (really a
&gt; concrete bunker) buried in the ground with slit windows and
&gt; more dirt piled on the roof, surrounded by "native low-water
&gt; shrubs".  Except for the glass in the windows, there was no
&gt; difference between this structure and an abandoned machine-gun
&gt; nest on the battlefield at Verdun.

=o= If this is the house I'm thinking of, the _Globe_ probably
got the photo from Mass. Electric.  Utility companies from coast
to coast tend to have an affinity for the most repulsive-looking
models of energy efficiency they can find.  I can't imagine why.

=o= That such an eyesore could even be taken semi-seriously is
surely due to the influential concrete block aesthetic foisted
on the world by Le Corbusier.  And thanks to Le Corb, the
energy-hoggish alternatives are little better:  The American
West is covered with concrete block houses, the same with a dab
of stucco, and aluminum-sided mobile homes -- all with giant air
conditioning units glommed on like so many symbiotic parasites.

=o= Most environmentalists aren't very fond of Corby's approach
to building design.  We tend to be more enamored with the work
of his most brilliant rival, Frank Lloyd Wright, which stressed
environmental harmony in design, materials *and* aesthetic.
This includes energy efficiency:  Wright was building passive
solar homes in the 1940s!

=o= There's a mini-Wright Renaissance going on even as we type.
It's spread as far as the snowbound Scandinavian lands, where
they're building some beautiful self-sufficient solar homes
(apparently the news that solar technologies are unworkable
hasn't reached them yet).  And the bunker at Verdun must contend
with far handsomer rivals made of adobe and terra cotta.

        Well, it could have been power-company propaganda, but the Globe
        doesn't go in for that sort of thing, plus, I was raised in a
        power-company household, so I've seen a lot of Edison Institute
        propoaganda.  I'm pretty sure that the "fashionable Corbu"
        explanation is more likely than the conspiratorial Reddy Kilowatt
        explanation.  It's all in "From Bauhaus to Our House" by Tom
        Wolfe.  The point I remember best was that brick looked good in
        all kinds of weather, but Corbu's "raw" concrete only looked its
        best with the sun shining brightly on it.

        There are a ton of Wright houses in Chicago and environs, in fact,
        ten tons of fabulous architecture in Chicago.  And, if you're ever
        in Pittsburgh, take the long and winding trail (about an hour) out
        to Wright's "Fallingwater" house.  You may have seen many photos
        of the house perched over the waterfall, but only when you see it
        will you understand what a wonderful house it is, how *nice* it
        would have been to live there.  Every room has a fireplace and a
        balcony, for instance.  One of this year's calendars in my office
        is all pix of "Fallingwater".

        (It might not have been *entirely* nice to live there.  Wright was
        known for objecting to the owners' choice of china and curtains in
        *his* houses.

        On the propaganda angle, I recall seeing a "Safetymobile" designed
        and built by Ford back in the 50s.  I believe it weighed something
        like two tons and I remember that it was plug ugly, with a sort of
        traffic guard rail all the way around the perimeter.  I thought
        even then that they were probably trying to discourage people from
        pushing for safer cars.

        And, uh, the phrase "symbiotic parasites" is a tad off.  Symbionts
        live in a happy relationship with one another, helping each other
        out whenever they can, but parasites are freeloaders who can kill
        the host.

I put a floppy into the drive of my SPARCstation 2 and unloaded some
software.  Then I realized that I'd have to get the floppy out, and
that this was UNIX, so who could guess what it would take?  wzx?
frmp?  mpltzk?  So I figured what the hell, and typed "eject".  The
floppy came out; I nearly fainted.

As I prepared to donate blood, an attractive (and I trust somewhat naive)
young lady questioned me about my medical history:

Q.  Have you had any surgery in the last five months?

A.  I don't think a vasectomy should prevent me from donating blood, do you?

[She paused to write "Vasectomy" on the form.]

Q.  Was that day surgery?

A.  Yup.  Just a local anesthetic.

[More notes were jotted.]

Q.  Has the condition been resolved?  Are you back to normal function?

        An article by Chen Zude describes the continuing growth of both
        professional and amateur Go in China. Last year's Qiwang
        tournament drew over 10,000 spectators to Ezhou in Hubei
        Province despite rainy weather and even though it was the first
        professional tournament ever sponsored in that city.
        Public commentaries were given in a gymnasium using a

That's half a football field.  Television might reach more people, but

Subj:   RE: Some internet groups

Yes, and some of the groups are kind of interesting themselves.  For example,
there is alt.forgery, which is just for forged messages, and, last time I
looked, mostly contained discussions of how to get the last vestiges of the
truth out of the headers of the your posted message.  Then there is
alt.hackers, which is a moderated group with no moderator so you have to figure
out how to forge moderator approval to post to it.

There are also a couple of FAQs that contain lists of groups with
"descriptions".  As I recall, they describe the alt.binaries.pictures hierarchy
as "megabytes of copyright violations" and the alt.sex.bondage.particle.physics
group as "the truth about the proton".

        caught the tone and guessing Unix, logged in on the guest account.
        He was trapped in mail with the header:  "Apply to speak to the
