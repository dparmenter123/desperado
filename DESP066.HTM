                Next to being right in this world, the best of all
        things is to be clearly and  definitely wrong, because you
        will come out somewhere.  If you go  buzzing about between
        right and  wrong, vibrating  and fluctuating, you come out
        nowhere; but  if you are  absolutely  and  thoroughly  and
        persistently  wrong, you  must some of these days have the
        extreme good fortune of knocking your head against a fact,
        and that sets you all straight again.

Have cut down on listening to WFNX, previously reported to be new boss
sound in town -- their playlist, while generally excellent, is very
limited.  New fave rave is latest incarnation of WBOS, where old
Boston jock Maxanne Satori has taken over as programming director.
Nice mix of new wave white, black, and oldies sounds.

Yes, this is so.  I am listening as I type.  Almost every time I turn
on WBOS I hear something I want to hear, although Dexy's Ubiquitous
Midnight Runners are welcome to that  weekend pass.  And they just played
the dread Doors, but it is easier to listen to than WBCN these days.
WBOS is at 93 FM.  Station owned by Dubbleware Overalls.  It's a
little MTVish, but still, when's the last time you heard Aretha and
Marvin Gaye?  Paul Revere and the Raiders and Tommy James and the
Shondells?  Elvis Costello and the Shoes?  All on the same station?
Plus reggae, rap, and the magnificent George Clinton.

Did you know that the U.K. has the highest proportion of home computers
in the world?

U.K. is the home of Clive Sinclair who built the ZX81, the first real
computer for 50 pounds (at $1.60, I'll let you work that out). This
was followed by the Spectrum, a colour computer for 125 pounds (16K)
or 175 pounds (48K). I believe this is to be marketed in US under
Timex flag. There has also been a government-inspired computer
literacy project, with subsidies for schools, and also a popular BBC
series with a specially designed micro, the BBC microcomputer (Model A
at L299 and Model B at L399). The 'Beeb' has proved extremely popular
and that is why there are not many micros in that price range (like
the Commodore 64) over here.

From the Technology column on the first page of Section 2 of the Wall
Street Journal a few days ago:

   Shortages of International Business Machines Corp.'s Personal Computer are
worsening. Across the country, major retailers are receiving half of the IBM
computers they order, and some get as few as 25%. The result is substantial
losses at stores that until recently had been very profitable.

   The supply problem is most severe with IBM'S new XT model. Retailers say
that for this month, they are being allotted only one of every seven ordered.
But all three IBM models are hard to get.

   "We're starved for product," says Rick Inatome, president of Computer Mart,
a 13-store chain based in Troy, Mich. As a consequence, Computer Mart is
showing a loss of $300,000 a month. Warns Anthony P. Morris, president of
Morris Decision Systems, a New York retailer, "We'll see dealers going belly
up because of this."

   The shortage stems from forecasts by IBM and its dealers that turned out to
be far lower than demand. Already this year, IBM has twice increased
production of the small computers. "We're doing everything we can to make
more," a company spokeswoman says.

   Meanwhile, however, the shortage is a boon for makers of other computers,
particularly those that can use programs written for the IBM. Some dealers are
promoting Apple computers. Some are selling slow-moving brands of computers
and related equipment at below cost. To reduce their dependence on a single
supplier, some IBM dealers are planning to stock computers made by the likes of
**Digital Equipment**, Texas Instruments or Compaq, a maker of a portable
computer that works like the IBM.

   "Thank God for Compaq," says Seymour Merrin, president of Computerworks of
Westport, Conn. "My lost IBM sales in May were $750,000. If I hadn't had
Compaqs to sell, I'd have lost about $160,000, bottom line."

   Even Compaq is frustrated, however. "We're already shipping as many
computers as we can make," says Rod Canion, president. "The demand is bigger
than IBM. It's bigger than both of us."

Subject: commercial market sensitivities

In a recent DESPERADO, a newspaper (or some such) article was quoted
as saying:

        The commercial market will be key to the Seahorse's success, one
        third-party source said, because the commercial market is
        dollar-sensitive, and not throughput-sensitive.

Which sounds like businese for what I've thought for a long time, that
people in the commercial sector will buy anything as long as it's
cheap -- never mind that it doesn't do anything.  Oh, well.

Well, it was bound to happen,

        first - The Preppie Handbook
        then  - The MBA Handbook
        then  - several other books in the same format.

....and NOW you guessed it.....

        The offical Silicon Valley Guy Handbook!?

You guessed it folks! A true handbook for REAL hard-core hackers.
Starring that lovable tool Bob Glazar as our hero Ray Fifo.

I received this book the other day as a gift/joke, it really is
TRASH reading but it does have some good points.

Silicon Valley Guys (abbreviated SVG's) are the Preppies or
Valley Girls of the Computer Set.  They even have their own
language and say things like:  "Let's hit the radio-shack".

Radio-shack is defined in the glossary as "a convenience market for
SVG's".

Starting your new job:

"Check out your wall mate's environment. Is his terminal on? Is
his chalkboard full of meaningless mathematical scribbles? Is his
IN basket full of printouts and candy wrappers? If so you can feel
confident your new neighbor is an SVG just like you."

"If, however, the desk is in pristine order, with the telephone in
a prominent position and the terminal is off, you can be pretty sure
this guy or gal is bucking for management. Proceed with extreme caution
in any endeavors to contact them either verbally or by electronic means."

"Perhaps your wall mate fits in neither of these two categories.
Perhaps, if you are extremley lucky, your wall mate's cubicle
will look like this:

        1. Cat calendar on the wall.

        2. Coffee cup with bunnies and/or lions on coaster on the
           desk.

        3. Bud vase with silk flowers next to terminal.

        4. Complicated-looking telephone with extra buttons
           on desk.

        5. Pillow in chair.

If the cubicle next to yours looks like this, you have been placed
in the high-rent office district of office modules. You're situated
next to a processing technican-a team secretary-a mom substitute
who'll take such good care of you that life in the office will be the
next best thing to coming home for Thanksgiving."

And then there is retirement:

"Retired. Not a pleasant word for someone whose main recreational
activity has been working late. Somehow the wizened old souls of
thirty-five learn to cope."

"It's not unusual to see two or three of these senior chippies
(another word for OLD SVG) show up at Burger King at about 11.30 a.m.,
in plenty of time to spot the younger guys from the plant coming
in for lunch. After a few informal edit statements (SVG talk), they'll
launch into a story about the good old days that bores the younger chippies,
but is nonetheless listened to with respect and tolerence for age. Who
CARES what life was like back in 1982? The retirees do. Some of
these guys remember TUBES. The first beeper (SVG status symbol plus).
Disks were more faulty than floppy. Living in the past is a BIG part
of the retirement years."

Interesting to note the photographs of Ray FIFO are all in DEC-standard
cubes using Rainbow 100 and GIGI equipment. Is someone trying
to tell us something?

The book is written by Patty Bell (no relation) and Doug Myrland.

By the way there is a Patricia A. Bell in the Digital Phone Book
in the New York City office.

Well, it doesn't mention VALGOL, but "The Official Silicon Valley Guy
Handbook" ($3.95, Avon) is otherwise pretty funny.  This takeoff on the popular
"Valley Girl" craze gives the inputs and the outputs of being a true
"chippie".

The book features "Ray Fifo" as the prototype SVG, and gives hints on
"Mainframe Fueling" (food), "Shopping for Software" (clothes),
"SVG Couples" (when chippie meets chippette), etc.  I don't know if it's
relevant, but the pictures of Ray Fifo's office show a Rainbow 100,
VMS manuals and an EDT reference card.

Some timeslices (samples):

(On teen-age SVG's):
        Q: How many teen-age SVG's does it take to change a light bulb?
        A: Five.
           - One to reroute the high-voltage lines from his
             neighborhood to Canada, causing a brownout all
             along the West Coast.
           - One to hijack a shipment of arc lamps headed for the Astrodome.
           - One to rewire the house with 12-inch coaxial cable.
           - One to install the six-ton air handler and cooling system, and:
           - One to unscrew the old bulb to substitute the greater
             light source.

(The Women of Silicon Valley [the entire chapter]):
           The computer industry has never been accused of discrimination
        on the basis of sex.  Here, if you've got the brains, you get
        the bytes.  There's only one important thing to say about the
        female aspect of the Silicon Valley type:
           The Silicon Valley Girl is simply a Silicon Valley Guy with
        longer hair and smaller feet.

(Popular Songs Heard Around Silicon Valley):
        We All Live in a Yellow Subroutine
        I'm in the Mode for Love
        Let's Get Digital
        I Heard It through the WATS Line

(Glossary):
        Bipolar - A big white bear who swings both ways.
        End sum - The love you take is equal to the love you make
        UNIVAC  - ENIAC's daughter, not to be confused with carpet sweepers

I got a big kick out of this book and, dare I admit it, found that a lot of
the SVG attributes applied to me; at least when I was in high school/college.
It's not great literature, but it's fun.

Ken Proxmire, a former tool grinder at the Detroit Cadillac factory,
quit his job upon learning he had won $10,000 in the state lottery. He
subsequently won the million dollar pot, making his earlier decision
to retire seem a little less impetuous. He has since gone into debt,
his fling at bowling alley management in California having collided
head on with the recession. Now living in the Sierras, Proxmire
suggests that lottery winners be given cost of living increases and
tax-exempt winnings.

"After all," he reasons, "it's the losers who should pay the taxes."

I should have known when you asked me about DECUS ET TUTAMEN that I
should go home and ask Richard, former Latin student and coin
collector. He stumbled across the Desperado mail on the subject and
said, "Well of COURSE that's what it means." (He also pronounced the
HONOR AND DEFENSE translation "not even close," in this particular
context, at least.)

It turns out that the inscription is not new for English coins and
that it was TRULY an ornament and a safeguard. Richard showed me a
1677 English crown, which has exactly the same inscription, and
explained that in those days the actual weight of a coin was very
important (governments hadn't yet come up with the idea of merely
assigning values to hunks of metal: a pound sterling was a pound
sterling). The inscription on the rim prevented unscrupulous types
(your baser elements, as it were) from filing silver from the rim and
passing off a coin worth less than its full face value. As long as the
inscription was intact, the coin was good.

So, now you have the full story. Was it worth it?

Cheers,

An article entitled "Intel Reveals Plans for 32-Bit Successor To
16-Bit Multibus" (Electronic Engineering Times, May 16/23, 1983, pg.
82), makes a number of statements about DEC's future plans:

"And DEC is expected to introduce a new faster multiprocessor-oriented
32-bit bus along with its low-end micro-VAX, the 11/610, and high-end
11/810, sometime this summer."

"It is not known if DEC is working on any kind of LSI interface chip
for its new VAX 11/610 or 11/810.  But observers strongly believe that
both will entail considerable new LSI, particularly the 610 that is
termed by some to be based on a "VAX on a chip."  It is more likely
that the 610 will use some enhanced version of the J- or T-11 chips
that emulate the PDP-11/70 and -11/23 instruction sets respectively.

"The desktop VAX, code-named Scorpio, is said to include a two-board
set using a new 32-bit bus."

We here in Scorpio and BI land were highly amused by this.  We were
also wondering who in DEC was making a J-11 emulate the VAX
instruction set.  Any of you folks in Hudson know?  We sure don't.
